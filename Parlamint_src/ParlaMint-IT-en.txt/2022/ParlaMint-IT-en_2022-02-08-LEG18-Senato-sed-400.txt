ParlaMint-IT_2022-02-08-LEG18-Senato-sed-400.ana.u10	CORRADO (Mixed). Mr President, on Saturday 29 January Geneva Sorresa, a two-year-old girl from Mesoraca, in Crotone, died at the Child Jesus Hospital in Rome. The young girl, who, after being positive at the Covid a couple of days before, had received the first care from the health care of 118 Campizzi, was then transported to the hospital Apulian Ciaccio of Catanzaro already in critical conditions for the serious respiratory failure and from there, with a military flight, because in need of ventilation in ECMO (Extracorporeal membranes oxygenation), to the paediatric hospital of the Capital, where however its conditions have made useless the intervention of the health care. As a rule, tragic events such as this awaken only for a few days the attention to the health deficiencies that Calabrians face every day in the spotlight. In the territory of origin of the small Geneva in particular, the High Marchesate of Crotone, which includes, besides Mesoraca, Cotronei, Petilia Policastro, Santa Severina and Roccabernarda, the users of more than 26,000 residents are seeing their right to health dismantled. The only medical care is in fact a clinic in the years gradually depowered, lacking in staff and with serious structural criticalities, started to an inexorable closure in the indifference of regional policy, despite the constant mobilization of the citizens. From the statements of the health care workers of Catanzaro who took charge of it, it seems that the small Geneva has been fatal the lack in Calabria of a center with pediatric ECMO therapy, but immediately President Occhiuto announced the creation of a complex unit of pediatrics in Catanzaro at the university hospital. As a Calabrian, although I hope that this announcement will take place as soon as possible, I would like to invite those responsible for regional health care to make every effort to address fully the difficult health situation of the whole territory, linked also but not only to the shortage of medical personnel who constantly desert the regional calls, also called in question by Occhiuto in the statements to the media. We need a real will to intervene to create better conditions in terms of meritocracy, technological and digital implementation, possibility of continuous professional updating, in order to really attract health professionals in Calabria and start a turning point. In the absence of skills and human capital, however, there would be any effort made in other directions, from the creation of new structures to the purchase of the most modern equipment. Pending this general reorganization, I hope that President Occhiuto will take the opportunity to finally listen to the cry for help of the community to which the child belonged, urgently restoring the essential services of which she has been deprived. Perhaps it would be a late form of moral compensation to you and those citizens who have been treated too long as children of a minor constitution. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-02-08-LEG18-Senato-sed-400.ana.u13	LEONE (M5S). Mr President, today with this speech I would like to pay attention to the oldest prisoner in Italy and to the serious health condition in which he is living. He is certainly a detainee from the malavitous curriculum of a certain thickness, but at the moment he is in very painful health conditions and aggravated by the age of eighty-eight years. Today I therefore have the opportunity to focus the attention once again on the Italian prison condition, that is the final segment of the entire judicial chain in which all the evils of the country peep, except then remain unsolved in those places. It is intolerable that everything that does not work should remain the responsibility of the prison police and the operators who work there, who are undersized and mostly with a certain length of service behind them. This systemic dysfunction, which runs parallel to the outside society, can no longer be overlooked: it is urgent to put your hand and as soon as possible. For example, the many-time-ventilated alternative measures have never been implemented systematically, as this case would deserve, precisely for the respect of the dignity of the person, which remains so even if held. In the speech given a few days ago by the President of the Republic, the appeal made to us parliamentarians to seek innovative solutions was particularly strong. Let us not miss this opportunity to make this epochal turning point; it was an invitation to all of us to find more dignified solutions for this large category of people, who are the prison population, but who do not cease to be a citizen of a democratic state. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-02-08-LEG18-Senato-sed-400.ana.u16	VANIN (M5S). Mr President, this speech I made today is part of that initiative, intended by the women of Parliament, which we called the relay for women in Afghanistan. My speech gives voice to the women and refugees who are in Italy, who have begged me to be their voice and to say their words. So I'll speak on behalf of the A2030 association. The situation of women in Afghanistan is getting worse, not just because of the cold, the economic crisis and the struggle for a piece of bread. On the human and civil rights front, the persecutions of young activists which have been publicly exposed in the most recent demonstrations or are already included in the black lists for their work in the years of cooperation with foreign organisations are intensifying. The recent news regarding the capture and disappearance of Alia Azizi, director of the women's prison of Herat, and of the other activists captured in recent days makes fear the worst for women who have played prominent roles such as judges, attorneys, policemen, journalists and human rights activists. In the same way, all students are in danger, who are formally still entitled to education, but who in fact see their courses closed and ask for the right of access to education. Study courses deemed suitable for women will be tolerated, invalidating study paths on which students have invested years and labors, but above all in which they had placed their hopes. Some testimonies gathered from the project Afghanistan 2030-Next Leaders, promoted by Culture Italy and the voluntary organization A2030, offer an important insight into this reality, on which we can and must act, in Italy, for young women ready to start a new life, and in Afghanistan, for women still in danger. Among the few lucky people who managed to leave the country we welcomed in Italy: graduated in nursing with three years of experience in the vaccination department, who hopes to continue his career in Italy; professor of computer science, Java language expert; computer science researcher, who developed a study; graduate in economics and student of the master's degree in economics. And many others, of which unfortunately we cannot name. With Afghanistan 2030-Next Leaders five different strategies of intervention have been identified, depending on the target audience: students, activists, teachers, professionals and entrepreneurs. This is an important project, characterized by a participatory design with the beneficiaries of the interventions, developing their requests for intervention on themes and targets considered priority and developing a partnership network that facilitates matching between the selected profiles and the opportunities for socio-economic integration, with the involvement of the private sector. For students who intend to continue their studies, students are intercepted opportunities for scholarships supporting candidates in the selection, registration and territorial transfer, also thanks to the support of Refugee Welcome Italy. For teachers contact the welcoming universities, indicating the opportunity of research grants and positions of visiting professor. For professionals and entrepreneurs a collaboration with Migrants is activated, for the validation of previous skills (this is important) and for the matching with the labour market; an accompaniment to migrant entrepreneurship. On the international front we are supporting students and teachers who hold scholarships in Italy, but the conditions for obtaining a visa are not at all favourable. Entrepreneurship programmes that model fair trade and online university courses are among the most ambitious goals they would like to achieve. For the most qualified profiles it would also be possible to send aid through the Migrants program and activate protected entry corridors through work matching with companies seeking specific skills. The first findings suggest that the path taken is the right one, but we still need an appeal to the institutions. There have been people blocked for months in Pakistan: for example - I say only the initials - S.M., already holder of a fully funded three-year scholarship, was on the expatriation lists already in August and today lives hidden in a shelter in Kabul, where he will soon put his son to the world without being able to leave his hiding place. We are asked to launch an appeal to universities (in Italy and beyond) to further promote scholarships and research, so as to allow a legal channel of exit from the country. I also appeal to professional federations to promote opportunities for qualified inclusion, internships and opportunities for training and conversion of titles, for example for women lawyers, journalists and human rights activists who are still in Kabul. The channels of aid from international policy need to elect female channels of aid distribution. We are here to bring the testimony of this association of women who are in Italy, but who ask us for help. [[Applause.]]
