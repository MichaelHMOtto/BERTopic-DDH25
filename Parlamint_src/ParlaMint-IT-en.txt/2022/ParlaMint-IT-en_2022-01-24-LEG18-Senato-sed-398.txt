ParlaMint-IT_2022-01-24-LEG18-Senato-sed-398.ana.u6	LANNUTTI (Misto-IdV). Madam President, in 2021 there were 1,404 deaths from accidents at work. Of these, 695 on locations of activity, with an increase of 18 percent compared to 2020. Also this weekend he was tormented by the white deaths with three other injuries, in the aftermath of the tragic end of Lorenzo Parelli, the eighteen-year-old student who lost his life on his last day of training. A worker died at Silca di Busano, in the province of Turin; another worker died in Pomezia, in the province of Rome, after a flight of five meters from the roof of a shed. Yesterday the thirteenth death of 2022: Alessandro Marcelli, in Lorica, Calabria. If every death at work is a death too much, that of Lorenzo, happened in a context that had to be even safer since it involved young students engaged in an alternation course school - work, is even more unbearable and difficult to accept. In Italy we are faced with an infinite massacre, says "L'Osservatore Romano" (L'Osservatore Romano). On 21 January, in fact, an eighteen-year-old boy from Friuli, Lorenzo Parelli, lost his life in an accident at work. My son - said his mother, Elena Dentesano - went out to school and never came back. A heartbreaking, unacceptable event that has struck and must make us think. For CISL, the internship in a company should guarantee the future to a young man, not lead him to death. For the Teacher Gilda we cannot think of exposing our students to exploitation, or worse, to accidents. The student from Friuli died working for free to mature educational credits. School is something else. Madam President, in my opinion this is also the poisoned fruit of neoliberalism practiced by this Government that makes use of the liberal thinker Bruno Leoni, funded by ENI, Confindustria, Autostrade, Rai, Generali, Fastweb, Exxon Italy, British American Tobacco, Vodafone, Google, Diana Bracco and the Swiss financier Tito Tettamanti, from whom the Government fish consultants. I close and thank you, Madam President, with the invitation to reflect on our times, on Law No 107 of 2015, but above all on that fetish called dictatorial neoliberalism which, having no care or respect for human life, has degraded people to the rank of goods. Thank you for your attention.
