ParlaMint-IT_2022-06-20-LEG18-Senato-sed-442.ana.u9	IANNONE (FdI). Mr President, we are truly shocked at the way the work is taking place, because for a week now three Commissions - the 1st, the 5th and the 7th - have practically been seized by the divisions of the majority. We express an extreme concern about such an important measure as we are going to examine, which will certainly be fired with the confidence of this House and run the risk that even the House will have to work on the weekend to meet the deadline. It really seems to us to be extremely serious that such a far-reaching measure, on which so much political attention has been drawn, is seeing an unprecedented development. We have seen so many in the current parliamentary term, but what is now being consumed has really gone beyond the loss of dignity of this House and of Parliament's institution. [[Applause.]]
