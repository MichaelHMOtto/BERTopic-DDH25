ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u7	I'm asking to talk.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u9	DESSI (UpC-CAL-Alt-PC-AI-Pr.SMART-IDV). Mr President, I would like to make it clear to the House why we decided not to vote on the timetable yesterday at the Conference of Leaders. Mr President, the acceleration that has taken place in recent days and the political situations that have arisen in recent months give rise to a particular moment, perhaps fundamental to Italian democracy. As you will know - I reminded you yesterday and we also spoke about it personally at the end of the Conference - thanks to a liberticide amendment fired by the House in recent months, only some parties and movements will be obliged in the next few days to collect over 70,000 signatures to have the possibility - they and therefore, through them, part of the Italian people - to submit lists and nominations at the next elections on 25 September. This amendment, President, written and drawn up - I must say - in a skillful manner by the historical parties and parties which composed the parliamentary majority until a few days ago obliges my party, the parties and members of the Group, other members and other groups in this House to spend the month of August, until 21, to compose the lists, to present the electoral symbols and to collect - as I said - over 70,000 signatures. Therefore, Mr President, you will have to forgive me if I continue with an alternative proposal for a timetable, which is the following. It is proposed to suspend immediately the work of the Senate in order to allow the Italian parliamentary democracy to be complete and, therefore, to give the possibility to the Groups, who did not receive the grace to have the exemption from the collection of signatures, to proceed to the same and to restart the work of the Assembly on 22 August, when the whole process of collection, collation and presentation of lists, nominations and symbols will be completed. [[Applause.]]
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u10	I put to the vote the proposal to amend the schedule of the Assembly's proceedings, tabled by Senator Dess√¨, to suspend the Senate's work and resume it on 22 August, in order to allow the Groups which must collect the signatures the time necessary to do so. It's not approved. [[Applause.]] The timetable for proceedings adopted by a majority of the Conference of Leaders and communicated by me to the Assembly remains therefore final.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u11	The next item is the continuation of the debate on document II, item 12. I remember that the debate ended at the sitting on 12 July. The rapporteurs asked that their replies be made following the examination of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure on the amendments tabled. I call the rapporteur, Senator Calderoli.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u12	Mr President, even if we interpret the thinking of the rapporteur, Senator Santangelo, we will give up our replies, if not to say that the work of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure has been carried out further. At the end of our work, all the amendments that were adopted were unanimously voted on, as was the unanimous mandate given to the rapporteurs. I would therefore like to make the possible explanation of the amendments and express my opinion on them.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u13	The rapporteur, Senator Santangelo, therefore does not intend to speak in his reply. I note that the vote on the individual articles of the document, as well as the additional amendments, requires an absolute majority of the members of the Senate. As agreed by the Conference of Leaders, these votes will take place at the end of the examination of the amendments relating to the text approved by the Junta. I would also point out that the votes for which an absolute majority is required are final decisions. Therefore, after these votes have been taken, the final vote on the document as a whole will not be taken.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u14	Mr President, with regard to the amendments referred to in Article 1, the Junta expressed its views as follows: the opinion is opposed to Amendments 1.1, 1.2. 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9. The opinion is in favour of amendment 1.10, while it is still opposed to amendments 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13. The Junta gave a favourable opinion on amendment 1,300. On 1.14 there is an invitation to withdraw. The opinion is opposed to Amendments Nos 1.15 and 1.16, while it is in favour of Amendments Nos 1,17. On Amendment 1.36 the opinion supports only point (a) and, therefore, there is a call for it to be reworded excluding point (b). The opinion was also in favour of amendment 1,301. On Amendments Nos 1,18 and 1,19 there is an invitation to withdraw, while the opinion is opposed to Amendments Nos 1,20, 1,21 and 1,22. On Amendment 1.24 there is a call for withdrawal, with the possible transformation of the agenda. The opinion is against amendment 1.26, in favour of 1.27, and still against amendments 1.28, 1.30, 1.31, 1.32 and 1.33. The opinion was in favour of amendment 1,302, against amendments 1,38 and 1,39 and still in favour of 1,40. On Amendment 1,43 the opinion is in favour only of point (a); therefore, if the presenter rewords it to that effect, the opinion would be in favour, since the amendment was identical to 1.44 on which a favourable opinion was expressed. The opinion is also in favour of amendment 1.45.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u17	SCHIFANI (FIBP-UDC). Mr President, I welcome the proposal for a partial rewording of Amendment 1.36. I would like to briefly inform the House of the content of our proposal, which is partly accepted and partly not accepted, but is then resolved in the context of the examination of Article 5, which deals with the issue of changing shirts and the limitations of contributions to Senators who change Group. The part on which the speakers spoke favorably provides for the abolition of a rule that we did not foresee, namely that to set up a Group in the future Senate it is sufficient to refer to a regional councillor elected in a single Region. There would have been an anomaly, Mr President, so it is sufficient for an adviser to be elected in the Abruzzo Region, in the Lombardy Region or in the Sicily Region, under the aegis of a certain symbol, to bring that symbol into the Senate, bringing together other elected parliamentarians in other parties. We felt that we did not agree with this proposal, because it is not part of the limitation that we gave ourselves during the current parliamentary term of office to reduce the possibilities of setting up groups that do not attach themselves to a national or European electoral round, as provided for in the current reform of the Rules of Procedure and as provided for in our work in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. The section on Article 5, on which the rapporteurs have spoken in the opposite direction, is resolved on the occasion of the issue that will be dealt with with with one of the last articles of the document, which we agree, because it concerns a hypothesis: the withdrawal of the entire contribution that every senator brings to a Group - a rule of the Rules that we know - in the event that this Member changes Group. We then agree on the disincentive, but we do not agree on the violation of Article 67, which provides that the Member is elected without limits of mandate, because we considered it an ablative solution to a constitutionally guaranteed right. This is resolved by a hypothesis that we have suggested and that will be accepted, also because there is an amendment signed by Senator Zaffini in this sense that we have shared, which provides for the limitation of the contribution and a coating between the Group that loses the senator and the Group that transposes it. This is good as a balance, but there must never be any penalty - initially feared in the work of the Junta - for groups that should lose their contributions to other Members already registered in their own country. This is the summary of Amendment No 1.36 and the reasons that lead me to accept the rapporteur's proposal for rewording.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u35	DE VECCHIS (Misto-IPI-PVU). Mr President, this amendment, which, in my opinion, is the synthesis of democracy, provides for the regulation of all parties that can request 2 per thousand. I would now like to make an appeal to all the group leaders, to you, Mr President, but also to President Mattarella. The vote will take place on 25 September. That's good. With wisdom President Mattarella decided to dissolve the Chambers. We respect it, but there is one problem: there are the smaller parties that have to collect signatures in the middle of August. I also address the other group leaders, Senators Malpezzi and Romeo, and all the Heads of the Senate: in August, with the courts closed, with the staff of the municipal offices on vacation, with the Italians on vacation, how can you think of giving voice to the minor parties if you do not meet these formations? I am not saying this for my party, but in the name of democracy to give all citizens the opportunity to find a symbol that represents them. I am truly appealing to those who have a heart for democracy: give everyone the opportunity to participate in the elections. Otherwise, do not speak of abstentionism and do not speak of a lack of institutional representation. Are we being wronged? I don't know. We would have collected her signatures, but in August it can become difficult, not only for us but also for other formations. So I appeal to all the political forces that love democracy. This is the house of democracy: let's give everyone a voice! Have the courage to give voice to everyone. Have this courage. ( [[Applause).]] Senator Pharaoh, Senator Malpezzi and Senators all help us! Help us defend democracy: not our party, but democracy. Otherwise, it's all hypocrisy! I don't want to attack anyone and I really mean it with simplicity. Italian citizens have the right to choose more symbols, otherwise we are not in democracy. In democracy there is a majority and opposition. We give the opportunity to win the opposition, because if there is only a majority, it is not democracy, but it is something else. And because here you all want to fight that other thing, called dictatorship, you help the minor formations. Prove courage! Have the courage to help democracy and not parties. Long live democracy! We'll be there somehow. Long live democracy! ( [[Applause).]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u39	Mr Malan (FdI). Mr President, I rise to vote in favour of Amendment 1.30. Coming into the substance of the proposal, today the Junta for elections and parliamentary immunity has a peculiarity, compared to the other Juntas, having a very particular task that is to decide on the election of one senator instead of another in the case of disputed elections or when there are appeals. It is a matter of deciding on arrest, authorisation to use telephone interceptions and other extremely sensitive issues. The Rules of Procedure currently in force today, very wisely, provide that the Assembly for elections and parliamentary immunity, unlike the others, cannot be a place where senators enter and leave and where a senator can be removed from the position of rapporteur on one of these important measures, this in order to prevent the Junta, which has very delicate functions - someone says courts, someone says parajurisditional - where, in any case, it is not decided in the last instance, because ultimately it decides the Assembly, but we work on issues such as arrests and legitimacy of election, become a political instrument in the hands of the Leaders group - who have, well understood, all our esteem, starting with our own - whereas today it should be an instrument that is based on the law, rules and defence of the prerogatives of the Senate rather than of the individual senator. While it has its justification to conform to the rules of the standing committees, for example, the junta for the Rules of Procedure, ensuring that if there are passages from one group to another the representation always respects the current conformation of the parliamentary groups, in this case the principle of faithfully representing the parliamentary group as it is in the Senate assembly as a whole should fall, because there is a much stronger principle, that is, that it must be decided on the basis of law. Imagine what would happen if a rapporteur who had to intervene in the matter of arrest did not comply with his group's expectations: he could easily be expelled from his group and perhaps then re-entered after a week, so that the Group would not lose this senator either, in order to assign the position of rapporteur to another senator who is faithful to the Group's indications. Since these are such sensitive issues, choices must be made according to science and conscience and not by group discipline, which is very useful in general parliamentary discipline. I therefore reiterate my request for a secret vote, recalling yet another detail: the rapporteurs for the election and confirmation of the senators of the various regions are chosen by a random mechanism established by the Rules of Procedure. In this way, we overcome this randomness that is extremely opportune, because obviously a senator member of the Junta can be of one party or another, and in the Regions unpredictable problems emerge and it is better to unpredict, otherwise we risk having also in this case a pilotage of the rapporteurs of the individual Regions and this would really go against the principles of thirdness, of fidelity to the law and to the science and to the consciousness that should be the fundamental principle of the work of the Junta for the elections and the immunity. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u42	FACTORS (Mixed). Mr President, I am speaking in support of what Senator Malan has said, having proposed such an amendment. We are faced with a very particular case, where the members of the Junta can be blackmailed by their party and can be expelled and removed from the Junta, in case maybe there is an authorization to proceed questionable or that concerns someone who has the strength to blackmail the senator in the Junta and to have him removed. The Juntas should have a different configuration than the other parliamentary committees. I call on you to reflect on the 5 Star Movement, which has always been very faithful to its own philosophy that a Member of Parliament should be judged as a common citizen. You realize that here we are faced with a partycracy, including with regard to justice within these classrooms. I call for caution when making amendments to the Regulations, because majorities change, parties change, party leaders change, and one day such a reform could turn against those who proposed it. I therefore welcome the request for a secret vote and welcome the calls for the members of the Junta to be treated differently. I address in particular the members of my former parliamentary group, inviting them to be very careful, because many of you have voted for permits to proceed delicately, where it was easy to be blackmailed. A tomorrow could happen that someone, who would like him to be brought to justice (as it should be), cannot be, because some senator will be expelled from his party and then will be expelled from the Junta.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u45	Mr Perilli (M5S). Mr President, I should like to make a brief comment, because since Senator Fattori's last statement, someone might assume that this matter was not dealt with with with all the pros and cons of the Junta, which, on the other hand, did a job in which it took account of many things, including the constitutional principles and the different opinions expressed by the various political parties. The current wording, which is essentially intended to protect, according to the statements of colleagues, is the exact opposite of the will and spirit of the Junta. We have made anti-transformism rules, which are at the root of the evil that parliaments are experiencing right now. I ask these Members whether it is right that a political movement, a party or a political force, which has seen so many Members elected in their ranks precisely because they were in these Juntas, now has no longer, within these same Juntas, parliamentarians representing the people who elected them. [[Applause]] We are faced with a condition and an abnormal state. It is the opposite: we represent the citizens and the citizens want us to sit in these bodies, so that we can decide on such delicate matters. But we are no longer in these bodies, because some of our Members have gone through other political forces. So it does not seem to me that there are the reasons for fear or great negativity expressed in reference to this rule; indeed it responds to a more general project, which concerns the contrast to transformationism. I see that there is from the right, that it also calls for a secret vote, an attempt to degrade or diminish the architecture of this norm. If they are in favour of transformation, they will tell us immediately (then we will learn it in the course of the votes). It seems strange to me that you come out of the Junta with an opinion and then, through an activity of the House (legitimate, for goodness sake), you tend to protect the transformation. It seems very clear to me the plan that the right and the Brothers of Italy are carrying out. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u48	Mr Quegliariello (Misto-Iac (I-C-EU-NdC (NC))). Mr President, this matter is very sensitive and cannot be resolved with a slogan. On the other hand, if someone knew what the historical phenomenon of transformation was, perhaps he would also have some extra caution. Let us put it this way: we have a Parliament which will be reduced in the number of its members and, of course, the modern parliaments will also work because there is party discipline, which must not be considered a negative thing, but which has indeed been the cornerstone of the functioning of parliamentary democracies. A great liberal, named Gladstone, said that a gentleman always chooses his own party between his own conscience and his own party. They were other times, evidently, and also other men. Having said that, if obviously there is a need for rationalization, in a Senate of 200 people that cannot become a Senate of 200 notables, there is also a principle that in some areas absolutely must be protected and is the principle of freedom of mandate. Where there is a strong involvement with conscience this is absolutely indispensable. Otherwise we would not disassemble transformism, but we would be in danger of disassembling the principle of representativeness which is the cornerstone of our parliamentaryism. And we would risk introducing, instead of the principle of representativeness, a mandate bond. One thing is party discipline, another thing is the bond of mandate. If there is a bond of mandate, you come out of the perimeter of parliamentarism. That is why I find the remarks made by Senator Malan to be entirely sensible, and I also ask you to be able to vote on this amendment by secret ballot. [[Applause.]]
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u49	I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u51	CUCCA (IV-PSI). Mr President, the subject is indeed sensitive and, even in this parliamentary term, we have had very hard and severe discussions on many occasions. I believe, however, that it should be remembered that the Council of Parliamentary Elections and Immunities should always decide on these matters by law and not by mandate or because it belongs to one party or another. [[Applause]] The law should apply, but it should apply to all and in the same way. On the other hand, in this House - and this is why, obviously speaking on a personal basis, I share the content of the arguments put forward by Senator Malan and reiterated by Senator Quagliariello - it has happened that there have been established principles whereby immunity must not be allowed to anyone, except that the same people who affirmed this principle, when they have been involved in such problems, have asked for immunity from the Junta. A minimum of right must be there and if we had in mind, I repeat once again, that the Junta must always decide according to the rules of law and not according to the personal gain or the intention to bring out an image or another, perhaps things would be much better. The problem is only this: to decide what is the task of the Junta, which would be decided in itself. I repeat this for the umpteenth time, because I have been repeating it for nine years: the decisions that the Junta takes must always be taken according to right and not according to membership, or to obey party orders. Always the application of the law: I personally, but also the groups of which I have been a member in these nine years, have always adhered to this rule and I believe that, all in all, we have always done well. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u60	BUCCARELLA (Misto-LEU-Eco). Mr President, I would like to point out to the Bureau that in voting on amendments 1.5, to Senator Zaffini's first signature, and 1.6, to Senator De Falco's first signature, we took a single vote, on the assumption - it seems to me wrong - of the identity of the substance of the two amendments. On the other hand, I think I can say that Amendment 1.5 proposed the deletion of the third period of Article 14 on proportionality guaranteed to non-attached senators, whereas Amendment 1.26 basically proposed the deletion of the second and third paragraphs. It's a different content, unless I'm wrong. We voted with a single vote for both proposals but, given the importance of the measure and to ensure that the vote is correct, I should like to point this out for the determinations that the Presidency will wish to take. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. What are the amendments in question? BUCCARELLA (Misto-LEU-Eco). 1.25 and 1.26. I believe that it was not right to vote in a single vote for both amendments. PRESIDENT. - The debate is Senator, amendment 1.25 has been withdrawn, so let's talk about nothing. BUCCARELLA (Misto-LEU-Eco). Excuse me, but in the announcement of the vote it was said that, given the identity of the content, one vote would take place; so I was allowed to point this out. But if one of the two had been withdrawn the question does not arise.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u61	Senator, we have already voted and we have reached the end of Article 1. If anything, if there had been something to say, it would have been said before the vote, not when the vote has already been taken. However, I have checked and it does not seem to me that its importance is fundamental, regardless of time issues. We shall now proceed to the examination of Article 2, on which amendments have been tabled, which I would ask the authors to explain.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u62	Mr President, amendments 2.0.3, 2.0.7 and 2.0.9 aim to regulate the professional figure of the parliamentary collaborator, by preventing the working relationship with the Member of Parliament from being left to the sole and sole bargaining between the parties, i.e. the senator and his collaborator, with the risk, which is widely noted by the professional associations, as well as by the information bodies and the Institute itself for Research on Public Administration, of producing distortions and irregularities which, colleagues, we are well aware of. I would like to thank the College of Quaestors for their attention on this subject, but, at the same time, to point out that the wording proposed by the rapporteurs only reiterates what is already in the readiness of the Senate Presidency Council, with the further limit of formally excluding, with a rule of law, the possibility of regulating the matter on the European model, i.e. direct contractualisation by the Institution on the advice of the Senator. In the light of this, Mr President, I would like the above amendments 2.0.3, 2.0.7 and 2.0.9 to be withdrawn at my signature.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u63	Mr President, with regard to amendment 2.0.1 to my first signature, I can only welcome the result achieved and for this I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Sant'Angelo and Mr Calderoli, for the excellent mediation work that has been done by redrafting my original amendment, which had been signed by so many colleagues from different political forces. The reformulation, as was in my original intention, provides for the digitisation of parliamentary acts, providing that the printing and distribution are replaced mainly by the digital format, entrusting to this and to the future Council of Presidency - let us talk about the Rules that will be in force from the next legislature - the definition of the acts that will be printed and distributed by means of the press. I am proud to have raised the question of the digitisation of acts to this House for the next parliamentary term. I would like unanimity on the vote on this amendment because, for the first time, I believe - perhaps I exaggerate if I say for the first time, but let me be a little proud - the Senate gives an example as regards digitisation to the entire public administration. Allow me, then, Mr President, to say a word of appreciation for Amendment No 1.44 in my signature: you know how much I have fought in recent years to guarantee the voices of dissent, and I am glad that this amendment has also received the favourable opinion of the rapporteurs and has been approved by this House. As I intended, the three minutes will be reinstated as a deadline to declare the vote in dissension with respect to your Group. I think it was essential to protect the voices of dissent and my amendment did what was right to do. I hope that this House will speak unanimously on Amendment 2.0.2 because it would be a good time for democracy.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u64	Mr President, first of all, I shall withdraw the amendments on which the Junta has expressed its opposition. We also withdraw amendment 2.12 (correct text), which we had tabled for the vote on a certain date, because we agreed on another text: we are pleased that we have achieved one of the central results in the amendments to the Rules of Procedure, so the agreed text will be the one we will vote on.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u99	Mr Zaffini (FdI). Mr President, we have taken part in the drafting of the new Rules of Procedure, as you have been able to verify, even in the restricted Committee, in a spirit that is absolutely available and constructive. I would also like to thank Mr Malan for having been more assiduous than I have been in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. It is clear that, when we are about to correct the rules governing the operation of a branch of Parliament, there can only be an approach of maximum seriousness, maximum correctness and maximum objectivity and not instrumentality. Well, this same spirit and attitude have only been grasped sporadically in the various speeches of my colleagues representing the majority. In fact, this is a regulation written by that majority that, at the time when the Draghi Government was still alive and therefore the concept of majority and opposition was valid, considered to write an organized regulation on contingency. That is what we have objected to from the very beginning. The rules of operation of the Senate of the Republic, in our opinion, cannot be written under the influence of an absolutely original circumstance such as the one that determined the course of the past legislature, by virtue of which the Chambers were dissolved a few days ago, as is known. The original circumstances of the course of that legislature have, for example, determined the hypertrophic representation of the Mixed Group, here as well as in the Chamber. Those circumstances were particular and original, I repeat: do we want to say that they were motivated a little 'also from the result of 2018? Are we to say that this Parliament was, from the outset, placed under a shadow, represented by the fact that a large part of its representatives were precisely members of the party that someone called "run away from home" (not me, but someone else)? Rules must be written to prevent this from happening again. It does not seem useful, for example, to predict the economic damage to the workings of the Groups when there are changes from one Group to another, when we know that the financial allocations of the Groups are obviously not benefits ad personam, but they are resources necessary to ensure the functioning of the Groups, even more so when about 30% of the Senators will fail with the implementation of the reform of the reduction in the number of Members. On the contrary, therefore, the resources, if anything, at a time when the groups will have to cope with legislative and secretariat work, for example, and with the increased work required of senators and Members, were to be increased. Another circumstance that does not convince us at all, as Senator Malan has explained perfectly, in his statement and in the request for the secret vote, is this bringing back to a political logic the functioning of the Council for the authorizations, as we imagine it will give rise to many messes that will then reverberate, as the colleague has rightly said, not so much on the prerogatives of the senators and not on the so-called privileges told with journalistic abbreviation by observers a little 'too' inattentive, but on prerogatives of the Senate to ensure an objective and objective operation. In all these circumstances, Mr President, which we have also discussed extensively in the debate on the functioning of the Junta, we shall abstain from voting on Rule 1 and then we shall see how we can vote on the subsequent articles.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u106	MAIORIN (M5S). Madam President, I wanted to briefly explain this amendment because, of all living beings, the human being is the only one who can boast such a sophisticated and articulated form of communication as verbal language. Language has always been the object of study and reflection, since the ancient philosophers, beginning with Heraclitus, Plato with his "Cratilo," passing through Aristotle, Epicurus and Cicero, to the modern linguists and philosophers of language, such as De Saussure and Chomsky, to mention only the best known names... (Brussio). It is true that, in addition to language, we are also able to produce guttural sounds, but we should use the human articulated language in this House. [[Applause]] Well, among the many theories about the origin and function of language that have followed over the centuries, on one thing all these thinkers are basically in agreement, that language is the fruit of the culture that expresses it. Analyzing it, in fact, is possible to understand much of that culture. Language describes reality and not only makes it communicatable, understandable and narrative, but it can also shape it or mystify it. The simplest and most widespread form of mystification is omission. Let me give an example: at the meeting there were Paul and Daniel; there was also Francesca, but I do not mention her and my interlocutor will think that she was not there. I didn't lie. I just omitted her. This is what language does with women today in the vast majority of cases, in bureaucratic, administrative and even institutional language, which should instead include and represent all and all. That is why I really want to thank, from the bottom of my heart, the rapporteurs today, President Calderoli and Senator Santangelo, together with all the members of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure in general, because I know that this amendment has also been a cause for animated debate, but in the end the spirit and the objective have been shared. The Rules of the Establishment of the Senate of the Republic are the son of a period in which women were a sporadic and exceptional presence within the institutions and democratic representation. This is no longer the case today, and this change must also be accepted and supported by the language of the Rules of Procedure. It is good, therefore, that we have been able to seize this opportunity of change to update the language, including women, by expressing them and not by omitting them. Beware: I know that not everyone agrees and that there are also women who prefer to be called "the president," "the director" or "the secretary," but can continue to do so. It is the choice that is lacking today, because the Rules of Procedure only cover men. [[Applause]] Where there is a choice, there is democracy; where 52% of the population is expressed and represented, there is democracy. We are proud to leave to those who will come after us a Regulation respecting democratic representation and the changed contemporary sensibility, especially that of the new generations. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u109	SCHIFANI (FIBP-UDC). Mr President, I would like to remind myself and my fellow Members that, initially, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure had been convened by your lordship on a binding and imperative subject, that of adapting our Rules of Procedure to the changed numerical composition of this Branch of Parliament. This was the object and this was the due motivation: to ensure that the next Senate has rules compatible with the lesser democratic representation. On the occasion of the work, it was decided unanimously to intervene surgically on the rules that could make the work of the legislation more fluid, eliminating those that were actually in the way of transparency and speed that the citizens asked us for in our work. He's done a lot. I quote, for example, a rule on which I reserve the right to speak, which provides for the text of the decree-laws to arrive in the Chamber after having already transposed the amendments adopted, with a view to greater fluidity and greater awareness on the part of colleagues of what they are voting on. Here we are faced with a proposal which, according to my modest opinion as a secular man and free thinker, goes beyond the border that had been set up by the Council for the Rules of Procedure, introducing a questionable and interesting subject, but which concerns respect for gender freedom in parliamentary language. Having trodden down the forensic classrooms for so many years, like you, President, I think the language is that of the lawyer and the magistrate, beyond their sex. This is because the function does not belong to the genre, but basically the function is the function and we are all the same here: men or women, we have equal dignity, equal right to vote and equal right to represent the Italians. At the same time, I believe that all this must be refined also to one possibility: the freedom of choice on the part of the parliamentarians who carry out certain functions of deciding how to be called, how to self-call and how to self-define in their own epistolary and oral communication. We talked about this in Junta and I personally greatly appreciated the position of the Presidency, which has tried to bring about a debate which I hope will be held in this House on these issues and on these issues, although, as far as I am concerned, we have decided to give our fellow Members freedom of vote and freedom of conscience. This is an argument which, in my opinion, is even incompatible and should have been declared inadmissible. However, in a logic of sharing these reforms, we did not feel it. Ours, however, is not a battle against gender discrimination or against women, but for the clarity of the rules that must be applied according to the will of the individual subject to whom they are carried out. That is why I believe it is necessary to use freedom of vote, as Forza Italia often does, when it takes decisions on issues that have nothing to do with political activity, sticking only to values of conscience.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u112	Mr Malan (FdI). Mr President, I would like to refer to what the signatory of the amendment, Senator Maiorino, who mentioned distinguished philosophers, scholars and literary scholars, both ancient and recent, rightly saying that language expresses a culture and a feeling. That is why language should not be subject to rigid regulations on one aspect rather than another. All those scholars, from Aristotle to the most recent ones, wrote in a language that they did not decide what rules he had, but they did make up for what the language had produced. The language is changing, sometimes it evolves into another and is extremely democratic. Suffice it to say that the language of the learned, the Latin, in our nation was surpassed by what was called vulgar, the language of the people, because the people won against the learned. The learned continued to write their scientific, philosophical and literal essays in Latin, but then won the people; between the Petrarch of the "Canzoniere" and the Petrarch who wrote in Latin, he won the Petrarch who wrote in vulgar language. So we are in use, which must be understood. Today we speak differently than seventy years ago, when the Constitution was written, but it must be a process that happens spontaneously, out of respect for certain categories and sensibilities; the rule cannot be laid down, otherwise we should also regulate a whole series of other situations, other categories, other expressive forms that have changed since the adoption of the Constitution to the present. We are abstaining on this amendment, because we would like to prevent it from starting to regulate from one step to the next. The language is free, it is an expression of the people and culture, as Mrs Maiorino said. This is why we refer to what the language expresses, knowing that it is changing; so today we use a language of a certain type, but a rule that perhaps, in twenty years, needs to be changed again.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u118	UNTERBERGER (Aut (SVP-PATT, UV)). Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this German debate was held 20 years ago. Today we discuss what to do in the plural, but no one discusses more than a position covered by a woman is declined to feminine. In the German world, if we discuss, we are looking for solutions for laws in which we must say "farmers and peasants", "artisans and artisans" and of course this weighs the law. The linguists try to find other solutions, but no one doubts the importance of the language, which creates reality. If in Italy all the apical positions are declined only to the masculine, while the less important positions are to the feminine, this obviously cements the stereotypes. Why do we have the cleaning lady and the judge, the minister and the president only to the male? There's no explanation. I do not understand the resistance of certain colleagues and unfortunately also of certain colleagues, because we do not talk about the private, we do not contest that everyone can be named, define as he wants. We are talking about the Rules of Procedure of the Senate and it is a matter for all women, if all the ministers are ministers and if the President of the Senate, the second office of the State, is Mr. President. This obviously affects. All people who don't see it when they hear a male definition have undergone a male figure in their heads. One day I heard a colleague from the center-right who I estimate on TV say that the lawyer colleagues who call themselves lawyer or lawyer are B-series. Then I realized that unfortunately for so many colleagues in the center-right, the female is B-series. They want to belong to Serie A and define themselves to the male. This is a sin, because it does not lead to gender equality. Male isn't neutral, it's not function. It is a person who performs these functions and the person is either female or male. This must be visible in the language, even more so in a parliamentary regulation in which, nowadays, we cannot even speak female. In fact, the questions I put to women have been returned to me in the male language. There is no choice now either. I believe that the Rules of Procedure of a Parliament cannot leave the choice, but must give guidelines for an inclusive language that gives visibility to women. Therefore, I really hope that many of you will vote in favour of this amendment in order to ensure that Italy - finally - can also take a step forward in the language, providing that at least in the positions covered by a woman there is women. Colleagues, I'll tell you one more thing. In Austria the anthem has even been corrected. To all the brothers mentioned in the hymn a sister has been added. I say this to tell you how different sensitivity is in other countries and how far back Italy is on this level. [[Applause from the Aut Groups (SVP-PATT, UV) and M5S, and Senator Laus.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u121	Senator Airola, I thought you wanted to intervene just to add your signature to the amendment. I am sorry, but you can no longer speak because Senator Maiorino has already spoken for your Group. Now you can no longer make any more details. I could have given you the floor if your intention had been to add the signature, as Senator Gaudiano did; otherwise, the Rules of Procedure do not allow it.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u124	VALENT (PD). Mr President, I would like to speak a few words with the utmost sobriety and calmness, without any ideological or outrageous approach. I have heard a few things in this House that I believe require all of us to reflect and say a few words of truth. I would particularly like to address my colleague, Mr Schifani, whom I particularly value for his political and institutional culture. When he says that the role and function are defined in the genre, I would like to tell him that the theme is precisely this: the role and function today are declined only to the masculine because they represent a culture that has seen within those roles and those functions, for many years and for the history of our country, a solely masculine protagonism. [[Applause from the PD and M5S groups]] Today, instead, we try to change this system and say that in those roles and functions there are also women. It is enough to take note of this and look at the heterogeneity of this House. We are different and we simply want this difference to be seen, read, recognized, called and verbalized, because the word also gives strength to things. It is absolutely not indifferent to the use of the declination of this kind also because the risk - and that is what many of us think is the greatest - is that when women come to play some roles they are then forced to approve themselves many times not only in language and that that language risks in some way the homologation and denial of a difference. The difference must be recognized and simply declined. However, it seems to me that this amendment, as written, is also very sober and balanced because it simply prevents the only male declination, almost to say that that function is essentially male. I would also simply reflect all of us on the fact that there are roles and functions that we historically decline to the feminine, without Surprise us. For the role of the teacher, we have always said that we can say the teacher or the teacher, while we find it difficult to decline parliamentary or president. Today we ask that this declination be made at least possible and I believe that this will make us all take a step of civilization and progress. [[Applause from the PD and M5S groups.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u127	DE PETRIS (Misto-LEU-Eco). Mr President, I would like to remind you that in our language - Italian - there is no such thing as neutral, but there is male and female. It is therefore clear that this is all the more true - this is the substance of Senator Maiorino's amendment - especially in institutional communication, when there are offices that represent and must represent citizens and citizens, so it must be stated: I am a senator because I am a woman, the senator is a man, so it is the recognition of a difference. The language cannot therefore be discriminatory from this point of view; there are no neutral institutional positions, there are no political ones, so they certainly do not exist from the point of view of gender (male or female) of those who hold a particular office. Mr President, we have a problem of discrimination, as Senator Valente said just now. The language becomes so discriminating because it erases this presence, especially in the polis, because in the world of professions perhaps, even if with great difficulty, a few steps have been taken, being that in the case of professional roles historically almost all women is not that men, who are there, assume the female diction. In any case, the question now arises in the polis, that is, in the place that par excellence continues to maintain this trace of discrimination. Therefore, not to name and not to recognize the male and the female means in fact once again to make a scavenger operation on a strong female presence. I can understand, Mr President, that there are certain figures in respect of which women's declination may even appear to be a devaluation, because they are historically perhaps not very high professional figures, but I think it is our duty to take a step forward, which cannot be separated from the path of recognition of gender equality. Article 3, which is the cornerstone of our Constitution and the Republican Pact, strictly prohibits discrimination and this of language is an absolute discrimination because it is the cancellation of women. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u130	Mr Calderoli, rapporteur. Mr President, first of all, as we approach the conclusion of our work, I note - and I thank you for that - that in an hour and three quarters this Senate has revolutionized a regulation for the second time, in my opinion not only with numerical adjustments but also improving the functioning of the Senate. Then we stop at what are proposed almost as religious battles. Personally, I am completely alien to the battles of religion because I don't believe it, but I think there is a principle of common sense that must be used whenever something is done. I have made an assessment of a first version of Mr Maiorino's amendment, which directly introduced important amendments into our Rules of Procedure, which I do not think can be dealt with in a forum like this, because they should be contained in a Rules of Procedure, something. As rapporteurs and as a Junta we have expressed a favourable opinion on a reformulated text, which I want to clarify why the speeches both in support and against do not correspond to the content of the amendment. The amendment aims to include an additional article whereby the Presidency Council, then the next one, sets out the general criteria - it does not just say how to amend the Rules of Procedure - so that in the institutional communication and in the activity of the administration it is ensured that the gender distinction is respected in language, i.e. by avoiding the use of a single gender in the identification of functions and roles, while respecting the principle of equality between men and women. I heard his friend and colleague Schifani say that it is right to leave the freedom of choice. I am voting for this amendment precisely in order to leave the freedom of choice, because today if I use a single genre I have already established that the other genre cannot be used. [[Applause]] So I want the President to call himself the President if he likes him, whether he is a man or a woman, and the President woman calls herself the President. I would not be the President in my case, because I will never be the President. Everything is then entrusted to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, which will make proposals, which will return to the House for possible transposition into the text of the Rules of Procedure of what we have stated in general terms. So, we don't do religious battles and move on. [[Applause.]]

A request for support had been made for a secret vote, after which the vote on this amendment was immediately taken. So much so that I too became confused for a moment and thought I should not have to vote; at last I voted in favour. Therefore, it remains to the record that Senator Gaudiano's request to repeat the vote was not at all leapt and was not biased. [[Applause.]]

Mr President, I am speaking on a matter of practice, since we do not have an explicit reference in the Rules of Procedure. Before the last vote on Rule 6, I would ask you to put the final coordination to the vote, since there will be no final vote. PRESIDENT. - The debate is I shall put it to the vote after the explanations of vote on Rule 6. A number of senators were asked to speak on Article 6, followed by the vote on the proposal for coordination and then the vote on Article 6. Mr Calderoli, rapporteur. Mr President, I would remind the House as a whole that absolute majority is also required on final coordination and on the last article. [[Comments.]]

The Presidency takes note of this and authorises it to do so. TRENTACOSTE (IPf-CD). I would like to stress that the long-standing Italian problem of the recognition of the figure of the parliamentary collaborator, also within the text of the Rules of Procedure of the Senate, is still not an end. In this way, not only do we not give dignity to people, professionals who daily assist us in the exercise of institutional functions, but we do not deny the implicit right of each of us to be able to make use of figures of collaboration within certain and univocal rules, which guarantee their working position, free from blackmail or contracts without rights, consistent with the role we are called to play, that is to guarantee the right to work for every citizen. The amendments I tabled and which I had to withdraw wanted to include this figure, at least in the Rules of Procedure, in order to arrive at a resolution of the Presidency Council that would frame it within clear and transparent rules, as is our duty. That is why I hope that this sad story will be able to end as soon as possible, presumably already from the next parliamentary term, by asking all the political components present today to be able to make such a commitment for the next parliamentary term. We must be able to make use of trusted, competent and qualified staff as an indispensable tool for a full and effective exercise of our prerogatives, regulating the figure of the parliamentary collaborator who is inexplicably left to different interpretations. Mr President, although it regretted yet another fact about a necessary reform, in view of what was previously expressed and the unique interest of the country and the establishment of the Senate, the Parliamentary Group Together for the Future Democratic Centre voted in favour of the previous articles and will also vote in favour of the latter.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u161	FARAONE (IV-PSI). Mr President, we have participated in the drafting and imagined some proposals for amending the Rules of Procedure which have certainly made them worthwhile. In theory, the Rules of Procedure had to be changed only for the parties concerning the reduction of the number of Members, so we should have only had to adapt ourselves for the committees and parliamentary groups to that provision which we adopted some time ago. After that, however, we have rightly decided to introduce some innovations that are important to us, even if others we have shared less. For example, we did not agree with the rule by which we in fact introduced the figure of stateless senators in the Rules of Procedure, with the idea that those who leave a Group can easily become an abstract entity even with different functions than those assigned to individual senators, thus distinguishing roles. In the same way, we did not fully share the choice to differentiate the numbers related to the composition of the Groups, so a group that was born at the beginning of the legislature can be made up of six senators, while one that is constituted during the legislature will be represented by nine senators. This is also a differentiation that we have not shared. We tried to reduce the composition of the groups, try to bring it back to arithmetic only and we found a mediation; however, it was the principle that did not convince us. However, in addition to this, Mr President, we have succeeded, thanks to the amendments tabled by the Italian Members of Parliament Viva-P.S.I., in introducing very positive elements. I am referring to the certain date and the idea that we can find a different instrument than the urgent decree to approve quickly the measures in the Senate, with the choice, entrusted to the senators, together with the Government, of which texts deserve the urgency procedure. Therefore, an extraordinary instrument, entrusted to the Senate and not only to the Government, is for us a very qualifying element that we have introduced and of which we are very proud. The same is true of the Committee on Legislation, which has existed in the House for a long time and which has not existed in us for too many years. We had proposed a composition and also powers other than those that have passed. It has been decided to resume, almost entirely, the House's Legislative Committee. The principle applies to us, namely the introduction of this organism and the functions it will perform. Therefore, the mediation proposed by us was also good, because this body is necessary and fundamental to the quality of our laws. As we have finally introduced, Mr President, after constitutional law No. 3 of 2001 had imagined it, without ever being introduced into the Rules of the Senate, the bicameral commission for regional affairs. In that case, too, our proposal was a bolder one, with a more protagonist role for the regions and for the local authorities. A reduced wording has passed, but this too is good, because the idea that some members of the Regions can participate in the legislative work of the Senate, for us, who are autonomous and federalist, is an important fact. Other issues concern the Institute of the Inspection Union, with the introduction of the obligation, for the Government that does not respect the time of response of the Inspection Union, to respond in the Chamber at the next sitting to that of expiration and non-compliance with the obligation of response. It is another innovation, which we wanted as Gruppo Italia Viva-P.S.I., and which has been introduced. Compared to the other very important innovation, Mr President, I address all the senators who have rejected amendments in the Commissions because of the lack of the government's technical report. We have asked and obtained that the Rules of Procedure provide that, from now on, the Government is obliged to submit the technical report on the individual amendments; and if the Government does not send the technical report, this cannot be a reason for forfeiture of the amendment submitted to the Senate. This is a very important innovation, because unfortunately in recent years many senators have rejected amendments due to the lack of technical report. It will not be possible for this to happen in the next parliamentary term. Therefore, Mr President, we are pleased with the new Rules of Procedure and the amendments to the Rules of Procedure that have been adopted. It could have been done better than the points I highlighted in my speech, but it is already a step forward. If we want to make a comparison with the Rules of Procedure of the House, we are far ahead of the House, with regard to the need to reconcile speed and quality of legislative action. We have already seen in this parliamentary term that our Rules of Procedure work better. I believe that with these innovations it will work even better, even for the next legislature, and I hope that the next Senate will be able to introduce those more courageous changes, which we would have liked to incorporate and which, unfortunately, have not been approved. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u164	DE PETRIS (Misto-LEU-Eco). Mr President, this is the second time - the previous one was in the last parliamentary term - that the Senate Assembly - I would like to stress that only the Senate has done so - it has set itself the duty to amend its Rules not only in order to try in some way to make more effective the activity of the senators, of the Assembly and of the Commissions, but also in the spirit of trying to counter that sort of historical vice, which evidently goes back to the times of the Kingdom of Italy to arrive to our days, which is the rather reprehensible practice of what has been identified as "transformism of the change of the case." This, of course, has led to a debate, in my opinion absolutely necessary, on the idea of respect for the Constitution as regards the absence of the mandate; but one thing is the absence of that constraint because it only responds to the citizens, another is a practice that we have already seen in the last legislature, but that in this legislature has reached the apotheosis, of continuous and constant changes of Groups compared to those in which they had been elected. This certainly produced a growth of the Mixed Group, of which I am President, but also a sort of constant spinning. One of the things we have tried to do, even in the long debate in the junta of the Rules of Procedure, is to make changes in this Rules of Procedure in order to put a stop to this practice. I have to say very sincerely that I do not know whether even the changes we have introduced and shared and on which we have reasoned a lot will then be effective in combating this practice, but they will certainly be able to contribute greatly to reducing the phenomenon in some way. Of course, it can be argued that we are only intervening through the Rules of Procedure and with a constraint and not through a path that restores democracy, parties and parliamentary groups a different authority, but this will be a political process in my view. You see, Mr President, we are going to vote again with an electoral law which perhaps will produce, once again, not a real choice on the part of the citizens of their representative, because with the current electoral law, in fact, as is happening in these hours, everything will once again be in the hands of the party secretaries. This is a vulnus that bears in itself the consequences that during the parliamentary term there may be Group changes, because it is as if there is no longer a direct relationship of trust between the citizen who chooses and his representative. Of course this is an issue which we will not be able to resolve by means of regulatory changes, but with the changes we have made we will certainly put in place a significant contrast. In this we have also produced a series of changes to finally give rules to the fact that - as is known - there was no formal recognition of the members of the Mixed Group here in the Senate. We have also amended the rules for the formation of groups. We have, in my opinion, done a serious job, anchoring it directly and effectively to the presentation at the general elections, and therefore to real political components. This is an important step forward. Other changes have become necessary - this is the second true reason - following the constitutional change that has reduced the number of senators, bringing it to 200. If we had not put our hands on an amendment to the Rules of Procedure, a difficult situation would certainly have arisen for the work of the next parliamentary term. However, I must maintain a little of my perplexity about the fact that the Commissions have been brought together. I have the impression that then, in the final choice - but perhaps we were faced with blocked roads - we were not able to make sure that there were actually more homogeneous Commissions in the content and workload. The third question is very important and I hope it will help. We have suffered a great deal in this legislature, more than in other legislatures, for the use and abuse of Article 81 of the Constitution, which was caused in fact by the Commission, never producing technical reports. The non-production of technical reports has in fact become a means of ensuring that some of the amendments that are not welcome are rejected. This was a further instrument that the Government used to impose its will on Parliament, particularly here in the Senate. Now, the introduction of the obligation of technical reports is certainly a step forward, which seeks to repair what is a vulnus, even if I have always argued - and I continue to argue - that the real vulnus has produced it, also with regard to the true freedom of decision-making on the various amendments and resolutions of Parliament, when we introduced in the Constitution the budget balance, the only country in Europe. This has become, over time, a real noose around the neck, as well as a strong element of weight and abuse of power vis-√†-vis Parliament and its choices, often linked not to budgetary cover but to the content of individual amendments. Other amendments have been introduced - in my opinion - which are absolutely positive, some of which are less significant than those on which I have focused. I think we've done a good job in the end, even with respect to the House, and we have to say it proudly. What these changes and the new Rules of Procedure will produce in terms of actual change will, of course, take place during the work of the next parliamentary term. For all these reasons, I announce the favorable vote of the undersigned and Senators Laforgia, Errani, Grasso, Buccarella and Rotolo. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u167	Mr Parrini (PD). Mr President, I use the space you kindly give me to make brief reflections on the type of work that has been done in the Rules of Procedure Committee, which you chaired, to address the issue of the reform of the Senate Rules of Procedure. The Rules of Procedure of the Senate are of the utmost importance. And I believe that we must say very clearly that we have managed to get the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to work, thanks to you who chaired it, to the rapporteurs, Mr Santangelo and Mr Calderoli, whom I thank, and also to Senator Perilli, who was the rapporteur at a previous stage, and to put his work away from the turbulence that always characterizes parliamentary activity and that during the last period have been particularly acute. This - as Senator De Petris has rightly pointed out - has enabled us to do good and serious work in the Committee and then in plenary. Today we are dismissing a regulation which is certainly better than the one we had, which takes into account the changes that have taken place in our Constitution and which allows us not only to adapt to reality, but also to make this branch of Parliament work better. It seems to me that, by doing so, we have fulfilled our duty to the institution we represent. I would also like to say my opinion on a possible minimalist reading of the work we have done. I believe that a minimalist reading would be wrong, because we have not chosen to deal only with changing the numerical requirements and quorums, which are obviously very present in the Rules of Procedure and should be changed. We have decided from the beginning to do a different and wider job; we have limited the scope of this broader work and decided to deal with the efficiency of the Senate's work and also with a serious political problem, such as that of parliamentary refugeeism, which in this last legislature has reached absolutely abnormal levels. With regard to the efficiency of parliamentary work, there are four things that I would like to mention as particularly important and of which I think we must be proud, as a collegiate body, in a very clear way. The first is the decision, which we have taken, to ensure that the Commissions 1a and 5a, which are the Senate Filter Commissions, which have a very important workload, decide, when they have to give opinions on measures which are of other Commissions' substance, only on the amendments adopted and not on all the amendments. It is a significant change, which allows us to give more efficiency and transparency to the work of these Commissions; just as I think it allows us to give more transparency to the work of this House, the fact that it will come to its examination no longer all the amendments already voted on in the Commissions, but the text of the measure as amended by the amendments voted on in the Commissions. It is one of the few points in which we adhere to the Rules of Procedure of the House of Deputies and I think it is important. Similarly, I think it is important to introduce the rule whereby a certain time limit can be set for the adoption of the measures. I believe that this is something that is intended to guarantee Parliament's prerogatives and not to stifle them. I think it is also significant what we have decided to do with regard to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. It existed in the Chamber of Deputies, but not in the Senate, and we introduce it to help us to have a better quality in the formulation of laws. Above all, we give the Senate a task which I consider to be extremely important and important, namely to provide an impact assessment on the legislative acts that are gradually being undertaken. It is not a small thing and, like all opportunities, it will have to be exploited well, but it seems significant to me. I should like to conclude by saying that the more political rules, which have put us in a position to pursue a general objective, those aimed at containing and curbing transfugeeism, are important. Not the list in detail, considering that it is important that the Junta as a whole has set itself this objective and has achieved it adequately. I say that having raised the problem of curbing transfugeeism, after the scale that this phenomenon has reached in this parliamentary term, does not at all represent - as some have said - an attack on the dignity of Parliament and on the prerogatives of individual Members, a surrender to anti-politics and something that is not legitimate. I believe that, when we leave physiology and go into pathology, we need to intervene and I think that these rules will help to defend the centrality of Parliament, its dignity, its work also to have a more transparent relationship between the elected and the electorate, an important aspect, which represents the reserve of credibility and confidence on which the prestige of the parliamentary institution is based. I would like to make a recommendation, also recalling one of the speeches made this morning: we do not mistreat Article 67 of the Constitution, the binding mandate or imperative mandate, which, of course, in our system, as in all European democratic systems, is prohibited. Words make sense. Bond of mandate is an expression that has a very precise meaning. Historically and in doctrine there is a bond of mandate when a person loses his office as a parliamentarians because of the opinions he has expressed and can be made to lapse from his office. It is not by chance that the bond of mandate is a typical trait of dictatorial orders and does not find room in democracies. Nothing similar to the bond of mandate is introduced by these initiatives; in fact, rules are introduced that are an incentive to exercise their mandate more correctly, which is quite different from the bond of mandate. I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs, and especially you, Mr President, who have led us in this work, which in particular in the final phase coincided with parliamentary convulsions which could also - let us be honest - send everything to sea. It is not even customary for us to vote on the reform of the Rules of Procedure in loose Chambers and under the extension regime. It seems to me that this goes to the credit of the person who allowed this job. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u170	SCHIFANI (FIBP-UDC). Mr President, on the subject of the reforms under consideration, I have little to add, because my colleagues have said a great deal. The overall view is undoubtedly favourable, because there have been rules to protect Parliament against the intrusiveness of the Government; rules also to fluidize - as has already been said - the transparency of legislative activity. Mr President, I am concerned about one aspect: the lack of parallelism in this reform with the House of Deputies. I am concerned that the other branch of Parliament, without any controversy on the part of myself, may give itself the time we have given ourselves or may adopt a regulation that is not synergistic and not complementary to what are our reforms included in the new Rules of Procedure. We don't know what he's gonna do. This is something which, in my opinion, should be dealt with as soon as possible in the logic of the agreements that always take place between the Presidents of the two branches of Parliament. Allow me, Mr President, to add a political consideration. We have done our part, Parliament has done its part and I very much hope that in the next parliamentary term we will return to the true bicameralism desired by the constituent Fathers. Let us also say that this legislature has seen a continuous and gradual weakening of what is the balancing of powers between Government and Parliament: recourse to votes of confidence since the first years of this legislature have compressed the activity and given rise - I remind myself - to appeals by individual parliamentarians of oppositions before the Constitutional Court for conflict of attribution. On that occasion the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal for lack of legitimacy, claiming that the individual Member was not entitled to challenge that measure or to appeal for the conflict, while partially sharing the merit of the protest. As you will recall, it was the occasion when the financial maneuver of the first Count government arrived in the Senate around 14-15 December. Then came the health and economic emergency and, therefore, the urgent decree saw a de facto monocameralism, alternated: a decree-law that arrived in a branch of Parliament was worked in the Commission, approved by a vote of confidence and sent to the other branch of Parliament only for ratification. And that is also what we have experienced in the light of the emergency, both economic and health, which saw the introduction in the decrees-laws of amendments that had little to do, violating the constitutional precept, with compatibility by subject matter. It has therefore resulted in irrational legislation, which is disconnected from the principles of our Charter. I very much hope that we can return, Mr President, to a true bicameralism, to the protection of the rights of the citizens who voted for us on the basis of a Constitutional Charter which provides for a double reading, which is synonymous with good legislation, in quality, transparency and fairness. With this wish, I announce the vote in favour of Forza Italia Berlusconi President-UDC. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u173	Mr Agussori (L-SP-PSd'Az). Mr President, allow me, at the beginning of my speech, to join in the thanks to the rapporteurs, Senators Calderoli and Santangelo, for the work they have done; congratulations which I extend to all the members of the Junta and, in particular, to those of the Committee which took part in its work, for the excellent positive and collaborative climate that took place during the work itself. Finally, Mr President, we have all appreciated the wise guidance and style in which you have addressed us over the last few months, knowing that you are firm if necessary, but also flexible in ensuring full autonomy for the Committee so that it can operate in the most productive and profitable way possible. Thank you, President. As we know, the reform of the Senate Rules has become necessary as a result of the constitutional change that has reduced the number of senators from the next legislature to 200. It is not clear that this is the right place to make judgements about the reform, but what is certain is that the many positive aspects of the reform risk being in vain, if not destabilizing, if it is not accompanied by a corresponding amendment to our Rules of Procedure; that it cannot only be that of a proportion of the various numerical parameters, but that it must also reorganize the functioning of some bodies in this branch of Parliament, the standing committees on all. It was decided to reduce their number to ten, because the current 14 format would lead to a poor and problematic composition of each of them. The necessary adjustments are based on thematic affinity criteria, but also on the workloads of each of them. The two filter committees, 1a and 5a, and 2a, which are among others the most burdened by the number of acts dealt with, are left unchanged. For the current 3rd, 4th and 14th, it was preferred to leave the European policies autonomous, thus bringing together foreign affairs and defence, which are among those which, given to the hand, have to date fewer tasks. Agriculture flows with productive activities, territory and environment with the Commission on public works, finally health with the Commission work and welfare. The occasion of the revision of the Regulation was also and above all useful to do the cutting al though excellent articulated that we use daily. The 2017 reform produced a slender Regulation, easy to interpret, which allowed our work to proceed smoothly and smoothly, with clear advantage on the quality of legislative production. The practical application during this parliamentary term has shown that it works well, but it has also highlighted the areas where it is perfect. The Junta proposes, therefore, some corrections in this regard and others to respond to some distortions that the political framework, in continuous and dynamic evolution, has produced. A new body, the Legislative Committee, is set up, drawing on the existing one in the Chamber of Deputies. Article 4 provides for an interesting novelty concerning the Parliamentary Committee on Regional Affairs, providing for the possibility of inviting representatives of the Regions, the Autonomous Provinces and the local authorities to participate in the meetings of the Commission itself in relation to specific measures. [[Applause]] This is an important signal of attention to local realities that fits in with the irreversible and untenable action that started with the referendum on autonomy of 22 October 2017. At the same time, it is envisaged that the European Union's Political Commission may invite Members of the European Parliament to participate, without the right to vote, in its meetings in relation to specific measures. On the other hand, we are putting forward at least three important amendments to facilitate our work, particularly in the Commission. First of all, there is greater clarity in the arrival and transposition of the amended decrees in the Commission to the House. The amendments adopted will be incorporated directly into the text (the so-called Annex A) and will no longer have to be voted on by the Assembly as Commission amendments. The examination of the decrees is therefore equal to that of ordinary drafts of law, with two obvious advantages... [[Brusio.]] Mr President, it is very difficult to speak.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u174	Actually, there's too much confusion. There is a buzz that does not allow you to listen to those who speak. Anyone who is not interested can leave the Chamber.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u175	Please, Senator Augussori. Mr Agussori (L-SP-PSd'Az). Thank you, Mr President. I would say that there will be two obvious advantages: greater clarity of the text and more streamlined work in this House as a result of the fewer votes needed. Secondly, it is envisaged that the filter committees (Constitutional Affairs and Budget Committees) should express their opinion only on the amendments adopted, and therefore downstream of the Commission's work on the substance and no longer upstream of all the amendments which have sometimes been tabled in an instrumental and massive manner and with subsequent texts 2, 3, 4, etc. This will enable the work of the Budget Commission to be considerably lightened, with the important possibility of applying greater discernment on the truly significant amendments, and will bring greater fluidity to the Commission's work on the substance, which today is too often subject to continuous stops and go and to the results of what is a genuine roulette. The third amendment, which is probably the most important political amendment, provides that the Budget Commission should no longer be required to give an opinion against the amendments to which the technical report does not come. From the next legislature, in fact, the Government will be required to transmit the technical report within five days of the request. If this is not transmitted, there is no more automatism which involves the presumption of honesty or lack of coverage, but it will be the Commission that evaluates it in full autonomy, as it is right that it is in a sovereign Parliament. It comes to fall, therefore, the alibi behind which the Ministries were used to hide so as not to allow the discussion of unpleasing themes. Let us therefore return to reaffirming the supremacy of the elected of the people over the bureaucrats of state. [[Applause]] A final chapter of the reform is aimed at countering the misconception of those who, once elected, relocate from one group to another as shipwrecked in continuous search of the landing place on a happy island. A number of disincentives, including economic ones, are put in place to counter this practice. As an example of what is happening in the European Parliament, the figure of the non-attached to any group is also expected for the elected senators, who are now only in use for those under the rule of law. This means that those who, by abandoning their Group, cannot join another Group, let alone the Mixed Group, are classified as such. Those who are expelled from their Group will be granted three days to join an existing Group. Non-members will be guaranteed areas of intervention and participation in the Commissions, but not the economic prerogatives provided for the Groups. It is also expected to be more rigid for the formation of new groups and components of the Mixed, with clear and non-negotiable criteria, with the typical alchemies of the First Republic. The new wording provides that new groups may be formed only if they are composed of 9 senators, instead of 6 - as we have seen - will be the new ordinary minimum number - representative of a party or political movement, of which they take the mark, which in the legislature has submitted its own candidates to the parliamentary elections or to the European Parliament, resulting in the election of its own representatives. Therefore, the new groups can only be set up at real parties. Other changes - always aimed at discouraging transformation - provide that the decline from office is extended to the Quaestors and to all members of the Councils. With regard to the Assembly of Elections and Immunities, the allocation of the Presidency to a representative of the opposition is strengthened, stating that this condition must continue throughout the term of office - under penalty of forfeiture - and not only occur at the time of election. Finally, Article 5 presents a final provision, always aimed at discouraging transfers to another parliamentary group, in which it is envisaged to amend the discipline of contributions to the Groups, both to curb the phenomenon of mobility concerned, and to achieve savings in expenditure for the Senate. I'm gonna do a little writing, ma'am. I sincerely regret what happened just now to the amendment tabled by Mr Maiorino: the reformulated text was genuinely balanced, our Group supported it and, on the request for a secret vote - as we have seen - it did not give support. We voted in favour of the amendment, but I regret to see what has happened in this House, namely that the necessary quorum has not been reached. Too bad years and years of struggles were thrown into the basket. I would point out, however, that in the field of the enlarged centre-left alone, wide field, wide field - as you wish - I have found the absence of 18 senators. I won't name them. Anyone who wants can look for them. Well, I have to say that battles - right or wrong, and this is a fair battle - are fought and won on the ground. [[Applause]] Otherwise, it's mere demagogy. Obviously those 18 senators don't have to account to me (we would miss), but they will have to make it to their electricians if anything. In conclusion, Mr President, we believe that this report, as dismissed by the Junta, is an excellent text, and, given that the amending phase in this House has further improved, enhanced and enhanced it, I strongly express the support of the Lega Group. [[Applause.]]

Mr President, this is very likely to be the last explanation of vote; given the circumstances, it is one of the last acts before the Senate, which is why, Mr President, I am going to make a little more political than the previous ones, because I would like to frame the amendment of the Rules of Procedure in a more comprehensive framework, also in the light of what our political strength has contributed to doing and bringing to this House. In fact, there is no doubt - and I believe it has been missed in the speeches of previous Members - that the main change, namely the adjustment in numbers, in quorums in committees and in the House, in all the work of the Senate, is due to a reform, the cut in the number of Members, which this political force has carried forward with determination and courage. [[Applause]] I am sorry that no one has mentioned this reform, which has also been approved by a large majority and which is to be attributed to Movimento 5 Stars. President, at this time when political forces are exchanging accusations and newspapers are focused on the political leader's line against each other, to blame each other, I am sorry that it is forgotten that the only political force that has brought to this House issues that were in the electoral programme and has achieved them was the Movimento 5 Stars. [[Applause]] And let's talk about the cut of the parliamentarians, of the income of citizenship, of the roughshods, of the cut of the vitalitys, and now also of the norms against the parliamentary transformation. Colleagues, we have reached almost 400 Members who have left the original election groups; perhaps, as I speak, someone is coming out and, therefore, it is a number destined to grow. [[Applause]] And in the debate that has always been going on, both on the reform of the cut in the number of Members, and on the question of transforming, during the legislatures, and therefore in the years in which you have been present with your political forces abundantly and constantly, you have never managed to achieve such goals. Well, at this time when it is easy to get lost in so many riots of controversy, problems and false issues, I want to remember the concrete and useful things that respond to the mandate that the voters have given us. [[Applause]] A revolutionary thing: remembering what you were elected for. We are also reproached that the cut in the number of Members of Parliament is also penalising us. Of course, it will also penalise us, because we do not think about our interests, but we try to do the best for the community, the one for which we were elected. If it is true, as it is true, that savings will be hundreds of millions of euros per legislature, there is not even a word about this: we simply think about adjustment, because it is a formal and due fact, but do we want to say it to whom such a result is attributed? [[Applause]] All right, we are at the beginning of an election campaign and of course you can read these episodes and the acts we have carried out in this Parliament as you wish. The fact remains - I repeat - that the 5 Star Movement is the only force that has carried out the electoral programme. [[Applause]] I am referring both to the programme with which he was elected and to the government contract in the various successive governments. Well, we must have the courage to admit it and to recognize the contribution we have made as a political force and as regards the reduction of vitality. We want to talk - for example - about the fact that, in the joints where the Movimento 5 Stars was present, because of parliamentary transformation, the only representatives who could plead the cause for which we were elected have passed to other parties and, therefore, we were no longer represented? [[Applause]] Other political forces began to wonder what the Movimento 5 Stars did. The Movimento 5 Stars does where it is represented, and not when it is the victim of mechanisms, such as this that we are now trying to fight. Of course, it was clear from the outset that important reforms are also achieved with the modification of parliamentary regulations: this is also a lesson for those who tried to amend the Constitution, precisely because they did not want to carry out these reforms. On the other hand, when we spoke about parliamentary regulations, we understood that the best way, including through disincentives and economically penalising the Groups, was to combat transformism. In this House - but it must also be clear outside - perhaps the only real disincentive is the economic penalty for the Group that receives the transfugue and for those who let it go, because it becomes a real market. [[Applause]] It is a market that destabilises an entire legislature. And we know very well that the transitions from the groups have put Parliament's standing at risk several times, regardless of political issues. And it makes me smile at those who talk about stability, knowing that there is a continuous movement within Parliament in the Groups, in both fronts. With this clarity in mind, since you will present yourselves and present yourself before the voters, everyone will then have to justify their behaviour; everyone will have to justify why he continues to defend the vitality; each one will have to justify why he does not carry out in the Council for authorization requests for arrest or interceptions. [[Applause]] The Movimento 5 Stars has everything in place and we'll show it. Here we are faced with much more than with the parliamentary reform of a regulation. Through these reforms we judge the political acts and activities of those who are sitting here in Parliament and who now have to return to the people to account. Of course, the amendments that we have tabled have been an opportunity to improve the Rules of Procedure and have reasonably and responsibly pushed the forces to intervene in other areas as well. Of course, this has to be done. It is a very positive fact that we wanted to rationalise and economize the progress of the work, abolish all those mechanisms that have always been designed to dilate the times and not to bring about the measures. I am sorry in all this that an amendment to the Movimento 5 Stars, at my first signature, was not adopted, with which certain times were asked, when a particular law had passed into a branch of Parliament, in the approval of the other House. This would certainly have accelerated the legislative process and somehow eliminated all the waste of time; above all, it would have shown that there is no need to change the Constitution to speed up the process of a law. [[Applause]] The amendment was not adopted, but it was important that we put it on the table. Just as important is what the Movimento 5 Stars did on the issue of the dematerialization of the files. We're soaked in paper. We are really pursuing the issues of ecological transition and respect for the environment: not a single word about this. We need to go in the direction of computerization. The budget law is one of those measures involving millions and millions of paper copies: this is absurd. It is also important to have made it possible to digitalise the submission of petitions. There is a lot of talk about participatory and representative democracy - and you mentioned the referendum - but you do it when it suits you, because it is not good for a political force to constantly defend those who are outside Parliament and want to bring their demands into Parliament. [[Applause]] These are all issues that our political strength has won in the Junta, of course with the agreement of the rapporteurs and other political forces. In my opinion, there is still a very bad point. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, also because of the culture from which we want to free this House. Failing to approve Senator Maiorino's amendment takes a giant step back [[Applause]] With regard to the many so-called declarations on the freedom and protection of women, on equality in language, on overcoming the gender distinction. Instead, it turned out to be a more divisive theme than the contrast to parliamentary transformation. [[Applause]] There is such a reluctance to address these issues - in fact only in this House, because the world goes on and we will be mocked for this - that the secret vote has once again become an escapism to reaffirm the cultural backwardness of those who should be ahead in the country [[Applause]] , of those who should bring out a profoundly different vision of society and culture from this House. This has been one of the most shameful chapters - and I am afraid it is widely foreseen - on the issue of the adoption of the new Rules of Procedure. Mr President, in concluding on this subject, precisely to give a signal in the direction I am referring to, I would ask you to move the bust of the first woman elected to the Senate, Senator Lina Merlin, who has spent so much time in the battles for the protection of women, from a corridor that is no longer visited by schoolchildren and people. [[Applause]] Remove that bust from the shadows and expose it in a Senate that does not even report the effigy of a woman; expose it in a much more visible place, as the associations and civil society ask. Let's start with these signals. At least move the symbol of those who have spent their time protecting women. [[Applause]] I am voting in favour of the Movimento 5 Stars. [[Applause]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u180	I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote in dissent from my Group.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u181	I take note of that and give you the floor.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u182	NUGNES (Misto-Man.A Pap PRc-Se). Mr President, I disagree and I still have this opportunity today. But in fact the concept of representative democracy has been torpedoed and sunk, although many - even in this House, I fear - still do not realize it. The reform of the Rules of Procedure, as regards one of the main problems you wanted to put on the table, that of transformation, has absolutely failed the objective, because you did not want to look at the problem and see it for what it is. We are not removing Article 67 of the Constitution - as the colleague of the Democratic Party has said - but we are moving in that direction, because this of the Rules of Procedure is only a piece, the second, which follows that of November-December 2017. Transformation is that of the parties, which are now in the hands of the super leaders who no longer give the chance to keep their electoral promises, the real only electoral mandate to which they should always respond. Even democratic centralism meant that there was always a broad internal debate, plurality of positions and a vote. Today this is no longer possible. Too many times transformation is determined not by personal interests, because there can be no personal interest in leaving a majority party relative to 33% to go into absolute irrelevance, but there is definitely maintenance of faith in the word given to the electorate. You are failing, but this piece gets stuck in the linear cut in the number of parliamentarians, carried on without changing the electoral law in a proportional sense, which you said was necessary to vote in favour of the reduction in the number of parliamentarians, after voting against three times. It was a condition, yet you did so without it being taken home and this is despicable in my opinion. This also fits in with the will to keep a chance... [[The microphone automatically switches off]] ..and not to others, which can also be seen in Article 6-a of Decree-Law No 41 of 2022, in which the possibility is attributed only to some small parties, to some small parliamentary groups, to be exempted from the collection of signatures of Ferragosto. I thank you and greet you all. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u186	The next item is the debate on the draft law No 2633, already approved by the House of Deputies. The rapporteur, Senator Binetti, requested permission to carry out the oral report. No comments were made and the request was accepted. I therefore call the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u187	Mr President, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, within the framework of mission 6 on health, provides for four types of reform affecting the three major areas of health services: hospital, territorial and prevention. The NCR reform of the Institutes of Health and Health Care (IRCCS) is the link between the objective of innovation in the field of health and health research. The aim of the reform is to strengthen the relationship between research, innovation and health care through the revision and updating of the regulatory framework and the legal regime of the scientific institutions and research policies of the Ministry of Health. The reform aims to make IRCCS more and more capable of bringing therapeutic innovation to the patient's bed, beside patients or at the home of patients, facilitating the exchange of expertise between IRCCS and other structures of the National Health System, introducing amendments to Legislative Decree No 288, which dates back 20 years. IRCCS are national institutions with autonomy and legal personality that, according to standards of excellence, pursue research purposes mainly related to clinical applications in the biomedical field and in that of the organisation and management of health services and carry out hospitalization and care services of high specialty. The delegation to the Government for the reordering of the discipline of the institutions of hospitalization and care of a scientific nature, referred to in Legislative Decree no. 288 of October 16, 2003, which we are discussing at the moment, was approved at first reading in the Chamber of Deputies on May 25 of this year. It is a draft law of government initiative, which represents a link to the maneuver of public finance. The PNRR provides that the law by which the IRCCS review plan will be drawn up will enter into force by the end of 2022 and requires the adoption of one or more legislative decrees within six months of the entry into force of the law. This, as you will understand, is the first issue that worries us, because the law must come into force by 31 December and, at the same time, the implementing decrees must be issued by the government that is not yet there. The current legislation on IRCCS is largely supported by Legislative Decree No 288 of 16 October 2003, which covers both public-law IRCCS, including those subsequently transformed into public-law foundations and private-law ones. Some rules refer only to IRCCS under public law, because for those under private law the principle of legal and administrative autonomy applies, as provided for in article 12, paragraph 1, of the same legislative decree. The current bill of delegation aims to strengthen the quality of health research of the National Health Service, in a mainly translational perspective, which favours clinical application through the strengthening of research policies of the Ministry of Health, which presupposes a deep and solid harmony between the scientific guidelines identified by the Ministry and the concrete choices of the various IRCCS, with the possibility that the IRCCS themselves propose high quality scientific projects to the Ministry. However, it is essential to respect the legal and administrative autonomy of IRCCS under private law and the principle of non-variability of public finance charges. The strengthening of the role of IRCCS provided for by the delegation law focuses as a priority on excellence in preclinical, clinical, translational, clinical and organizational research and therefore on innovation and technology transfer, with particular attention to care and assistance tasks in those areas recognised at international level according to the main diagnostic categories, without losing sight of those disciplinary specializations that are not directly related to MCDs, because they address issues and problems also of niche and for which there are specific national coordination programmes, such as the different national plans planned for specific areas. I am thinking of the national plan for rare diseases, which, as the Government knows, has not yet been published, the recently published national plan for oncology, but which still deviates far too far from the European plan for oncology; I am thinking of the national plan for disability, the plan for chronicity and many other things. In other words, if at the centre of IRCCS' attention are those pathologies that have the greatest impact on the population, the attention also to highly specialised pathologies remains high. The current delegation law requires that the revision of the criteria used for the recognition, revocation and confirmation of the scientific character of IRCCS and therefore their qualification takes place every four years compared to the current two years. The reason is easily intuitive, since obtaining certain results both in clinical and scientific terms, appropriately confirmed by a series of subsequent trials, takes a time reasonably commensurate with the objectives that are to be achieved. The priority criterion to be included and to be confirmed among IRCCS remains, however, defined by the level of excellence of the hospitalization and care activity carried out in recent years and by the technical-scientific contribution provided through a biomedical research activity recognised at national and international level. It is important to stress that the character of excellence must concern both the care activity and the research activity, carried out in the specific discipline assigned. The evaluation of excellence also includes governance criteria, financing and evaluation of IRCCS networks, compliance with the principles of organisational and management flexibility, quality of operational simplification, knowledge sharing and the development of shared infrastructure and technology platforms. The latter must be open to collaboration with the other bodies of the National Health Service, with international networks or research groups, with scientific and industrial partners, national and international. Among the criteria of excellence there is always participation in the different clinical-assistant research networks at national and international level, avoiding in any way forms of self-referential isolation and sharing more protocols, materials, methods, results, etc. The delegation law distinguishes between the single-thematic IRCCS, which received recognition for a single disciplinary specialisation and the polythematical IRCCS, which received recognition for several integrated areas. The aim is to enhance both models, without ever losing sight of excellence, measured according to international standards. New IRCCS awards for university hospitals may also include several areas, provided they are complementary and integrated. The delegation considers among the criteria of primary interest for the evaluation not only the thematic area which is the subject of the recognition, but also the territorial location of the IRCCS, in order to obtain a wide distribution in the national territory, and the minimum user base of each of the thematic areas, in full respect of the regional health programming, especially with regard to the economic and financial aspects. Another interesting point of the current delegation law is the coordination between the Directorate-General and the Scientific Directorate of IRCCS, which implies a concrete involvement of the Scientific Director in the strategic direction of the Institute and in the allocation of shared objectives, to ensure the necessary link between research activities and assistance activities in the thematic areas which are recognised and in line with the regional and national health policy guidelines. [[The microphone starts flashing.]] I assume that the time available to me is running out of time and I shall therefore end in a few words, emphasizing the element that may be of greater interest to all colleagues. IRCCS today represents the link between scientific research of excellence, clinical-assistant activity of excellence and organizational-management models of excellence. There is no doubt that behind these three nodes, each of us is able to find everything that does not work in hospitals today, when the clinical-assistant activity is not excellent and just the dissatisfaction of the patients to confirm it, when the research in those fields does not achieve the necessary innovation objectives and when the flop is related not so much to the lack of skills or dedication of the clinicians or researchers who devote themselves to this, but rather to the disorganization and fragmentation of services for the patients (we see it in the theme of prolonged files and delays). Therefore, betting on IRCCS today means betting not on a niche, but on a part from which it could resume and start a complete rethink of that "hospital" medicine, which is now inspired by many university models, which can change the quality of life and the public and private care of many patients in Italy.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u188	As agreed by the Conference of Leaders, the general discussion will not take place.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u189	Mr President, I am in favour of all the agendas. In particular, the agenda I have presented is simply the collection and putting in line of all the commitments proposed by my colleagues. The objective is very specific and has been explained also this morning; by now our parliamentary system proceeds to alternating Chambers. This bill has already been approved by the House and therefore the room for manoeuvre we have to modify it is close to zero; the only way we can affect it is by the agenda. To have an agenda that gathers the commitments of all and to propose them again means to emphasize the desire that in the implementing decrees, which are the conditions of this delegation law, full account should be taken of what is the work of the Commission, a work which is strongly shared, deeply integrated and aimed exclusively at improving the quality of assistance and research.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u190	Senator Binetti, to remain in the minutes, the opinion was therefore in favour of the agenda G1.100, G1.1, G1.2, G1.3, G1.4 and G 1.5.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u191	Mr President, the Government gives its assent to the rapporteur's opinion.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u192	Having been accepted by the Government, the agendas will not be put to the vote.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u193	I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u194	You have the right to do so.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u195	Parent (IV-PSI). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representative of the Government, the delegation for the reordering of the discipline of the institutes of scientific shelter and care is a very important measure, as the rapporteur has well explained, because it is linked to the budgetary maneuver and to the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience. It is a very important measure for the health of our citizenship, for excellence and Italian research. Since, however, after its approval, the rule needs implementing decrees within the current year, this legislation also risks being delayed because of this vicious and sudden advance of the end of the legislature. But that's it. With today's standard in approval, the role of IRCCS is strengthened to promote excellence in preclinical, clinical, translational, clinical organizational research and technology transfer and to strengthen the criteria to ensure a higher quality of care activity. In the Senate, in this system of alternating bicameralism in which we fell, we could not change the text. However, we have closed the measure in the Commission which I honour to chair with a great sense of responsibility of the senators and senators, aware of the importance of the time for the adoption of the legislation because it is linked to the resources of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. We went on even when a negative technical report of the State Accounting came in. We had a little bit of a stake as senators and senators because we were in the presence of a measure already approved in the other House of Parliament. However, we have three basic issues that I hope will be addressed in the next implementing decrees and in the near future. The first concerns resources. If we increase the number of IRCCS, this must be done on the basis of unchanged finance or by binding a share of regional resources. It is unclear whether the captive quotas would be introduced on the basis of the standard health needs of the individual region or the standard national health needs. The second question concerns staff. It is clear that we cannot give up our Italian excellence if there is a shortage of staff even in IRCCS facilities or if there is no adequate training. Finally, the unity of the rules. In the law of reform of the institutes of hospitalization and care of scientific character is not previewed the assignment of functions to IRCCS and each Region regulates the matter in autonomous and diversified way, not existence a framework law that obliges the Regions to regulate the respective functions of the Institutes. The work we have done in the Commission has mainly been about agendas and I would like to thank the rapporteur, my colleagues and my colleagues for the work we have done, what little we have been given. One of my agendas, approved in the Commission, is to include in the decree implementing the IRCCS Reform Act a framework rule requiring all regions to approve a unified reference framework, defining the functions of IRCCS both under public and private law. These three issues I pose (resources, personnel and training and uniformity of health throughout the national territory) are the crucial issues to be attacked in the near future, if we really want the health system in Italy, after the trauma of the pandemic, to guarantee the health of all of us. I was struck, ladies and gentlemen, President, by today's statement by the President of the Conference of Regions, Stefano Bonaccini, who calls it surreal that the government has not yet given them the money they have spent to cure, hospitalize and vaccinate people during the Covid-19. In addition, the increase in energy costs will affect the functioning of public facilities and hospitals. I therefore think that the issue of resources is important for IRCCS, but also for health in general. If we don't start with these, which represent our excellences, I don't know what we could start with. I hope and hope - and my Group will put pressure on this - that in the next decree-law aid will be put at the centre, with adequate resources, of the resources that the regions need after the pandemic. In conclusion, the core of the delegation we are voting for is to ensure that the reform objectives arising from the PNRR's component 2 of mission 6 "Health" concerning innovation, research and digitisation of the National Health Service are met, with the aim of strengthening the relationship between research, innovation and health care and enabling the IRCCS system to respond to the new challenges posed to the National Health Service. We never tire - and I do so on this occasion too - of thanking the social and health staff. Anyone who has had the opportunity to be a user of our excellences, IRCCS, knows how much preparation, competence and self-denial there is in the professionalism we need. That is why politics has a duty to return something and in these other five or six months of legislature we would really have wanted to fix health care in Italy. However, as I said before, so much so; our commitment to these issues will continue, even from the next decree-law aid. The Italian Socialist Group Viva-Partito Italiano votes in favour of the measure. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u198	MAUTONE (IPF-CD). Mr President, representative of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Senator Binetti, for her pragmatic and very incisive work, which has enabled us to achieve results also thanks to the sudden acceptance by the Government of the various agendas. I would like to thank the President of the Commission, Senator Parente, for the proper emphasis she has given to the measure. The bill that we are preparing to approve today brings the discipline of delegation to the Government for the reordering of institutes of hospitalization and care of a scientific nature. This reform, which is already included among the objectives of the PNRR, involves both public and private institutions. As we all know, these institutions are a spearhead of our health organization and are confronted with the best European centres of advanced research and assistance of high quality and professionalism, for the many heterogeneous pathologies treated, which have a significant clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic impact for citizens and patients. Qualifying and characterising points of scientific institutions are, precisely, their precise identification and their legal recognition as entities of national importance and their particular standards of excellence always of the highest quality. They have management autonomy and legal personality. The essential basis for the activities of these institutions is their research: an advanced research, but perfectly linked to clinical application. Here, precisely, translational research linked in a consequental and continuous way to clinical diagnostics and therapy; to promote quality research, making the best use of its results and applying them to the care of the patient, objectively improving the standards of diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic performance, not forgetting - precisely - the care and hospitalizations always of high or very high specialty. It is essential to find the best ways and the best conditions (this is a strong invitation to the Government) for their reorganization and further strengthening, recognizing their irreplaceable and driving role. The institutions represent and will have to represent more and more, each for its own field of action, real flowers in the crown of our health structure. Another point that I think is important to stress is the implementation of staff mobility for health research between public-law institutions of hospitalization and care, universities and public research bodies. The comparison, the exchange of scientific experiences, their valorization and their involvement with other scientific and research realities can only enrich the heritage of knowledge and allow the achievement of increasingly prestigious objectives for Italian research. In medical research, as in many other realities, we do more by cooperating and working together to achieve goals and results that are useful and decisive for complex pathologies and often with little treatment possibilities for patients who are affected by it. Fundamental will be a more careful and homogeneous distribution of these institutions throughout the national territory, with their more rational positioning in the structures of regional and national health networks. In fact, the current distribution of these institutions shows a clear prevalence in some areas of our country, penalising other regional realities. In this regard, I have presented an agenda, accepted by the Government, which provides for the reordering of the network of these institutes and that this is carried out in compliance with a more homogeneous distribution throughout the national territory, guaranteeing the presence of at least one center of excellence in each individual region. I have also included on the same agenda the establishment of new institutes of scientific hospitalization and care in the mother-child area in order to ensure translational research, care and the promotion of clinical excellence in children. All this goes in the right direction to give more attention to the complex problems of the mother-child area, in which so many steps have been taken, but so much progress remains to be made. Reorganising and strengthening these institutions - I shall conclude, Mr President - is a duty of the institutions and of politics (with capital capital) and a right of Italian citizens. Our research applied to the clinic can and must become a characteristic trait of our organization and our health structure. Our health needs leading and qualifying structures, as they must be - and they are - the institutions of hospitalization and care of a scientific nature. On measures such as these, which raise and enhance Italian research and improve the performance of citizens, the Group Together for the Future-Democratic Centre will give its support and its vote in favour. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u200	You have the right to do so.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u201	Mr Zaffini (FdI). Mr President, in spite of the appearances, this is a very important measure: it concerns the reorganization and the new financing criteria of an important part of our health care, of our National Health Service, both that provided by public facilities and that, in the case of IRCCS, which is, moreover, the majority, provided by private facilities. In our country, there are 51 institutions of hospitalization and scientific care: 31 are so-called private ones, among which there are centres of excellence such as St. Raffaele, the Child Jesus - talking about individuals, in this case, is obviously a euphemism - and 20 are public, referring directly to the National Health Service. We have examined this text carefully and, to be honest, Mr Sileri, we were more concerned about it a few months ago when we read it and followed the work in the other branch of Parliament. What happened reassures us in part, since the delegation law will probably fall to the center-right, which will also be called to govern the fate of national health care. So, from this point of view, we're a little less concerned (but of course we're all begging!). But what is the point of this reasoning? The basic idea of the establishment of these centres of assistance and research was the translation of knowledge between research and assistance: it seems a banality, but nobody tells us - even today - what is the result achieved after almost forty years by the law and after twenty years by the most substantial reform of 2003. What are the results and results of the copious resources addressed to these scientific institutions (defined as IRCCS), in terms of assistance and, for example, of impact factor for research? How much have these institutions been enriched in terms of innovation baggage, innovative networks and ability to adhere to care and care needs, compared to the resources addressed? This money, my colleague Sileri, has it been spent or invested? This is the issue that is missing in the text. One cannot but start from an analysis of what has happened over the last twenty, thirty or forty years in order to act in terms of the reorganization of these institutions. Moreover, we know that everything fits - as the President of our Commission has rightly pointed out - in a framework of reordering of the PNRR mission 6, so in the big issue of reordering territorial assistance, but also of the hospital, so all this remains to be done. I repeat that we would have been 100% concerned; we care about 50%, but it remains a incomplete text, from this point of view. Let me give you an example to understand and to clarify: many of these IRCCS have peripheral locations, which have obviously led to an area of spending centres. Have they served? Can we confirm them all? I have some doubts about that. I would like to understand what the budget for these years is. One way of clarifying to Parliament what is happening with regard to this important piece of national health care would, for example, be a regular report detailing with anticipation what is happening, because it is obvious that these institutions receive resources through the regions (by contract, private IRCCS; by convention, public IRCCS), but they are still paid for in performance. How were these performances? It is a doubt that remains and will remain - I fear - for some more time. Having said that, the text as a whole is normal, also thanks to the agendas on which it has been given a favourable opinion. I would like to thank Mrs Binetti, as rapporteur for the text, for being always precise and precise, as I have seen in our four years of attendance at the Commission. We will therefore vote in favour, because we have no particular reason to distinguish ourselves from the vote on this measure, but with a final wish, which echoes the controversy that Mr Parente rightly referred to. We have a huge amount of money for health care through a thousand channels, one of which is IRCCS. If there is no detailed and precise logic of evaluating these expenses, so that the investment content can be determined rather than spending, then it is clear that the Regions are right a thousand times, when they claim, even today, that they have not been reimbursed of the greater expenses incurred and documented, according to the instructions received from the Ministry, regarding the various waves of Covid. This is very serious, ladies and gentlemen, because the regions have faced it with their own resources, sometimes with important reserves: there are some - let us think of the larger ones - which have allocated abundant reserves to the need to balance the higher Covid costs. The State must intervene on these and cannot refer them to the Regions, because they all go into disarray on this road. This is a serious, serious problem. There is another serious problem: ladies and gentlemen, do you know that the National Health Fund is not yet allocated, directed and agreed, as the law provides? The regions have not yet given the green light to the National Health Fund, because they clearly and rightly call for greater attention, for example, to higher energy costs. Think how much more a hospital can cost for a thousand beds (and see that there are so many around Italy): well, here can not be worth the logic and the game of the cerino; to who remains in the hand? In the past few days we had started a cognitive survey with the Health and Health Commission and we first listened to the head of the Ministry of Economics and Finance assigned to the National Health Fund, but there were no answers to this. If up to now there has been a deficit of sensitivity - denounced, not later than today, by President Fedriga - towards the need to allocate resources having good attention to their concrete results and results, of these resources, also of IRCCS, this is the theme that will engage the next majority, the next Government and the next parliamentarians who will sit among these scranni and that will deal with health. I would like to hope that this greater sensitivity will be widely shared, beyond the sides and the game of the parties. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u204	Errani (Misto-Leu-Eco). Mr President, representatives of the Government, colleagues, rapporteur, Mrs Binetti, thank you. I believe that this is an important measure, but once again we have not had the opportunity to improve it, as has been said, so the agenda instrument has still been used. I would like to make a comment on the subject of democracy. The process of screwing and centralization in the government is now significant. We are going to the elections and all of us have spoken critically about this process of screwing. It will be up to the new parliamentary groups to be consistent with the need to give Parliament a role. Having said that, is research and assistance a fundamental point? Yes, because when we talk about IRCCS, we're not just talking about research and hospitals, we're talking about assistance. One point that has not yet been resolved - and I hope that with the implementing decrees we can give a resolution - is how to integrate and link and system with the National Health Service the research and assistance of IRCCS and how to implement the entire national health system from the technological, welfare and diffusion point of view of technologies and innovations. We must overcome - and I hope that we will go in this direction in the implementing decrees, because it is not public or private here, but there are IRCCS, their qualities and their excellences - the separations that still exist in the integrated overall health system. From this point of view, it is important that, for example, new criteria are established in the evaluation of the research, the funding that is distributed and the directors that are selected for public and private research institutions. This is not to call into question the autonomy of the institutions - I agree, Senator Binetti - but the criteria and professional characteristics of the researchers must find a common facility for both private and public institutions. Then, in my opinion, there is the big question of building a plant in relation to all the regions - as the President of the Commission has said - not with a centralist inspiration, but certainly not according to the idea that everyone in his own region does what he wants. I always repeat, in fact, that the health system, as the name itself says, is national and the competence of the Regions lies in the management, not in the definition of the fundamental principles. I say this about a mistaken interpretation of differentiated autonomy in my view. The basic principles are common, national and of the whole health system. I would like to take the opportunity to make two other brief comments. Firstly, I hope that in the next decree-law aid (we will talk about the deviation, ended this debate) there will be a health intervention regarding the financing of the health system, which is inadequate, even with the intelligence to understand that a regulatory intervention is indispensable that allows the regions, with their resources, to spread the debt recorded in 2021-2022 in ten to fifteen years, without that it means entering directly into the return plans, that is, with the increase of taxation and with all that it means. I am quite clear that we are late from this point of view. The other measure that I hope will find an answer in the forthcoming decrees concerns staff. I have already pointed out that there is an emergency in the staff, which is no longer linked to the training funnel, which we have solved, but it takes years to put this solution into order. It is therefore necessary to find extraordinary forms not to produce a twist of the public health system, which is what is happening. From this point of view, the central theme remains. Covid taught us not one, but two things. The first is the absolute value of the public health system; the second is that this system requires serious, organic reform, capable of building new balances. If we are talking about IRCCS, it is clear that we cannot go forward in a country where the Southern regions do not have these structures of excellence; it is clear that we cannot force people to move families, because we are talking about complex diseases, in which not only the patient, but the family, are moving for months. These situations need to be resolved with organic policies and planning, not with policies made up of spot interventions. From this point of view, I hope that it will be possible to have a serious debate and at the same time to approve immediately the measures I have listed, otherwise different regions will default. I say this and I emphasize it: they will go to default, no one can say that he did not understand it. I also hope that there will indeed be a major public debate on the reform of the health system, enhancing the principles of that extraordinary law which established it, but with deep organisational innovation. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u207	BOLDRINI (PD). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues have already said many things. This is an important measure, linked both to the budget law and also to the PNRR mission 6, which component 2 is related to health. The aim of this reform is very important: to strengthen the relationship between research, innovation and health care, which is currently lacking. We realize that research often takes place in laboratories, but we find it hard to understand what the positive effect is on people. Famous innovative therapies are born in laboratories, but they must obviously end up in the care and therefore in the improvement of the quality of life of people. That is why we need to get our hands on the IRCSS network, including from a legal point of view. We know that they were set up in 2003, so now light years from everything that has happened. What we need is quality health research, which has an invaluable value for our country and which is known for its extraordinary implications, as we have seen during the pandemic. We had never talked so much about research; we had never talked so much about the need to invest in research. That is why this is a necessary reform. We have a large number of IRCSS institutes: 52. But if you go to see where they are structured, in the national map we find a big difference between North and South. However, we do not want to succeed what Senator Errani also mentioned, that is, a transmigration by those who need innovative therapies, forced to go to another region. It is a necessary reform, therefore, in order to innovate and to direct the activities to the transfer of effective and innovative interventions in the welfare practice and to achieve hospitalization and care services with high speciality, but giving the clear and explicit function of guaranteeing the fundamental synergy between research, innovation and assistance, which unfortunately is not yet there. We therefore innovate the institutions with this reform, but, as others have also mentioned, it provides for a law of delegation, which will be entrusted to the next Government, which I hope will have great sensitivity. Here, in fact, we really need to work, to effectively monitor these funds and how they will act on the territories. They must be monitored and there must be quality standards that must always be taken care of. Therefore, fundamental are the points of the reform that recall, precisely, the concepts of transparency, monitoring of standards compared to IRCSS and above all fair access to care in IRCSS by citizens throughout the national territory, without seeing penalized even a part of our territory, such as the South of our country, and in order not to discriminate those who need innovative care, guaranteeing the improvement of investments in research in order to maintain the letter of Article 32 of the Constitution that we often quote. In words, we know very well the value of research, but only in words, unfortunately. We recognized his value when the pandemic occurred. My hope is that we will soon realize the need for research and that we can therefore all commit ourselves, because in therapeutic innovation we must invest and this will only be possible if we do so with more research funds. Compared to the research funds that need to be put in place, we are talking here about important research: from preclinical to clinical research, to the so-called translational research, which really improves the quality of people's lives. I appeal here to my fellow Members, because it is important to do more appropriate research, as well as care must be more appropriate. I am also referring to pharmacological research with a gender approach. Yes, I would also add this aspect, because more funds must be allocated to interdisciplinary, biomedical, pharmacological and humanistic research, which takes into account gender and gender differences in research facilities and the applicability of data collected in translation. We know, ladies and gentlemen - beyond the amendment, unfortunately this morning, on the inclusion of language - that drugs have different effects in the bodies of men and in the bodies of women. More research is therefore needed, including in the field of pharmacology, to take this aspect into account. There is a provision for this, Article 1 of the Law on the Reform of Professional Orders, known as the Law on Lorenzin. I believe that we need to consider a forthcoming speech on this issue too, otherwise we will never see the effects and effectiveness of greater appropriateness even in treatment. If we improve the pharmacological part, of course, also the therapeutic part and therefore the quality of life will improve. I believe that this is a work to be carried out and I hope that a future government will do so (his colleague said centre-right, and I would hope a lot of centre-left), but I must say this because this must be a challenge, which, through the recognition of IRCCS, takes into account the needs of the different territories, also in view of the minimum reference area, as the law also provides, for each thematic area of research. It is therefore necessary to ensure fair access to care, to optimise the provision of health care and to ensure that the overall funding of research within the health fund, as the previous colleague mentioned, does not remain adequate, but increases, because these are investments: the more well people are, the less they will need to be treated over time. However, it is necessary to stress the importance of another topic, namely research, excellence and competitiveness, because research cannot be without human resources. This is a crucial issue, because only with the human resources employed and the strengthening of the role of researchers in predicting a path that can lead to their stabilisation in terms of contract will we be able to have research. It is known that researchers, if they have a contract that is not stable and receive better offers, go abroad and lose it is our country, which is no longer innovative. On this point, therefore, we in the Democratic Party have put forward proposals, even if not in this measure, because we have adapted to a more important wish (in this regard, I must thank all the Members of the Commission and the rapporteur): to bring home a measure that we knew was closed down, because it had another path, that of the implementing decrees, which was to end by 31 December, so we are somehow adequate, although we know that the resources are needed here. That is why we have not tabled any amendments, even though I have tabled them personally in many other measures, but unfortunately they have not been successful because of the financial disparities. This, however, is another important issue to be put to the attention of the Government for the umpteenth time - what it will be, because we are currently in disposal - in the hope that it will be taken into consideration. We cannot ignore this objective of strengthening research even through the recruitment of our researchers with stable contracts: we cannot remember them only at times like that during the pandemic, when results have been achieved and we have all incensed them. We must remember this every day, because the path of research is long and lasting and must be programmatic. We must do something more and make their path secure, so that we can give certain horizons to their professional outlet, because I believe we must not abandon them. As far as investment in research is concerned, we also have an investment in resources of 1.4% of GDP: we will have to increase it a lot, and I believe that this is an important objective, which we must set ourselves. That is why we, as a Democratic Party, are voting in favour of this measure, in the hope that everything I have said will happen as soon as possible.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u210	Mr Rizzotti (FIBP-UDC). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Senator Binetti, very much for her contribution to this measure. The reform of the institutions of hospitalization and scientific care today in the examination of the Senate Assembly is an important step forward in the strengthening and rationalization of biomedical research. Unfortunately, this branch of Parliament has only been able to take note of the important work done by colleagues in the House. We would have liked to take a few more steps - as Senator Boldrini said - than, for example, the stabilisation of precarious researchers, who have long been waiting for certain answers. It is they, these men and women, that we must retain, because they represent an invaluable force of the Italian health fabric. It is in order not to let them escape that we must ensure the presence on national territory of excellences such as IRCCS. I thank the Government for accepting an agenda on behalf of me and Senator Stable, precisely for the stabilisation of the precarious. [[Applause]] In these two years we have established the extraordinary ability that research has had in the search for a vaccine that can save many lives. The common feature of these institutions and medical institutions is the close correlation between basic research and clinical practice, with an effort to avoid dead times between scientific discovery and its practical use in lanes. This approach, called translational, is summed up by the Anglo-Saxon motto bench to bedside : from the lab benches directly to the patient's bed. IRCCS translational medicine teams work with a constant eye to the clinical application of their findings as soon as possible, but in a bidirectional communication logic. Researchers transmit the results of their research to the clinicians, but they also receive constant feedback from the hospital departments present in the institution itself. The IRCCS reform is a rib of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and will only be fully implemented when the delegated decrees provided for in the measure have been adopted. The aim of regulatory intervention is to strengthen the role of institutions and to review the procedure for the recognition of the scientific character of a hospital and also the procedures for revocation or confirmation. It is expected that institutions will require confirmation of recognition every four years and no longer every two years (as planned today), because research can take a little longer. For the purpose of recognition, the criterion of the localization of the institute and that of the minimum reference area for each thematic area of intervention will be assessed, but patients will be assured full accessibility to the institution, regardless of their place of residence. Of course, one of the most important points of the measure is the need to coordinate in a more effective way the general direction and scientific direction of the hospital, in order to make more effective the translational aspects of the relationship between research and clinical. The draft law provides that the research activity is carried out in compliance with the criteria of transparency and research integrity, i.e. in compliance with the ethical values and ethical duties of those who carry out research, and open science, i.e. the principles of reproducibility, collaboration, accessibility and rigour recognized at international level. Unfortunately, the measure is not able to commit new and more public resources to biomedical research; the hope is that private investment can compensate for the necessary accounting prudence expressed by the rule. I repeat that economic support, especially for young researchers, also aimed at stabilising their contracts, could limit the diaspora, sometimes without return, of our brightest youngsters, in this and in many other professions. [[Applause]] I conclude by confirming the favorable vote of Forza Italia, with a wish, which I hope is sometimes heard, compared to the many implementing legislative decrees that in recent years the Ministry of Health has not issued. Hurry up, because this time it will not only be the hard and tiring work of Italian researchers and not even just patients, who look forward to new treatments. This time the whole country will pay, because it would lose yet another great opportunity to make Italian health care the best system in the world. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u213	MARIN (L-SP-PSd'Az). Mr President, I would like to thank Senator Binetti for having expressed her support for the adoption of all the agendas, showing a great cooperative spirit, but also a great deal of sensitivity to all the issues that have been presented. For the quality of the services, the institutes of hospitalization and scientific care (IRCCS) are characterized as poles of excellence and reference centers for research activities, performing hospitalization and care services of high specialty, and represent a dynamic tool for the promotion, development and application of innovative technologies and therapies, in the field of health and biomedical. It therefore seems appropriate to integrate IRCCS' research activity with that on emerging and devastating diseases, with functional cognitive decay, which is a theme that has always been part of the themes of the League and which is particularly recurring in my personal choices, in parliamentary activity and beyond. It is desirable to encourage the integration of the same in the network of territorial structures, becoming a reference of high specialization and support for the care and treatment of psychiatric diseases, including through the adoption of models that provide an integrated multidisciplinary approach, in order to build extraordinary plans of intervention, aimed to implement permanently the health and social assistance services for persons suffering from mental disorders, as well as to ensure, in compliance with the constitutional principles referred to in Article 32 of the Constitution, and especially in compliance with the legislation of other European States, full access to care for patients and patients suffering from a mental disorder, who choose to undergo voluntary health treatment (TSV). [[Applause]] This is in order to ensure the taking-in, care and continuous care of the patient with critical and severe psychic disorder, for which it is not objectively predictable to discharge from the hospital in the short term, to prevent relapses, promote stabilisation and circumvent mandatory health treatment (TSO). According to data provided by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in its focus on "Cutting down mental health," severe depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other serious mental diseases reduce life expectancy by an average of twenty years compared to the general population, similar to chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. 5 percent of the world's working age population has severe mental illness and an additional 15 percent suffer from a more common form. This naturally reduces employment and productivity prospects and wages. Direct and indirect costs, according to OECD statistics, may exceed 4% of gross domestic product. In Italy, 17 million people suffer from mental illness. Moreover, Italy is in the twentieth place in Europe as a number of psychiatrists working in the public sector and we are at the last place for the number of beds. The reform of IRCCS is one of the actions identified in the PNRR to improve the country's structural situation and is an integral part of the recovery that is also intended to be activated through European resources. In addition, as can be seen from the Update Note to the 2021 Economy and Finance Document, it is a tool linked to the 2022-2024 budget maneuver. On behalf of the Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione party, I voted in favour and conclude with a quote: A fundamental role for the support of people with mental illness continues to be played by families, often burdened with a difficult management from an economic and relational point of view. The role of the institutions is therefore important, so that no one is left alone and everyone is allowed access to the most appropriate assistance throughout the national territory. (...) Mental health is a right that must be guaranteed to all (Sergio Mattarella, 10 October 2020). [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u216	PIRRO (M5S). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reorganisation of the IRCCS network in order to strengthen and improve the relationship between research, innovation and health care is one of the measures envisaged under mission 6 Health of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, within component 2 Innovation Research and Digitalisation of the National Health Service. The reform of these structures is one of the actions identified in the PNRR to improve the country's structural situation and in this sense is an integral part of the recovery that is intended to be activated thanks to European resources. The fundamental function of these research institutes, as provided for in Legislative Decree no. 288 of 2003, is to be research entities aimed at the pursuit of mainly clinical and translational research in the biomedical field and in the organization of the management of health services. I thank the rapporteur, Senator Binetti, for her work and patience in putting together so many different forces. It is true that in the Health Commission we almost always get along, because everyone's goal is to protect the health of citizens and we have noticed in recent years how fundamental this is for the whole country system to work. [[Applause]] After decades of delays and lack of investment, finally it took a shock to the entire planet to make it understood also to the Italian political class. As other Members have already said, we have not been able to make any changes to the Senate in this measure. We have adopted the system, which has now been tested and which we hope will no longer be necessary in the future, to give our instructions to the government with agendas and we have done this as Movimento 5 Stars. We have asked for a rule within future measures for the allocation of resources to enable the stabilisation of health research staff and staff for health research support activities, which we had already asked for with an amendment to the last budget law, which unfortunately has not been approved and which I hope will be resumed in the future, because research cannot always and only go on with precarious staff, with people who do not know what their destiny will be tomorrow morning or in a month's time. [[Applause]] This is the case in universities, it is the case in IRCCS, it is the case in other research institutions. We must give stability to young people so that they do not flee abroad. We have also asked for precise criteria to better decline the proven experience and professionalism in order to be able to aspire to the governance roles of IRCCS also in order to break that link, which we have so much talked about, in the appointments of health leaders, between politics and leadership, with the aim of implementing the decisive separation between politics and administration in the management of the national health system, because in recent years the mix between the two spheres has represented one of the most important causes of inefficiency in this field. We have called for the integration of IRCCS research into pre-clinical, translational and clinical organizational, as well as technological innovation and technology transfer, strengthening the tasks of care and assistance carried out by the territorial network, including in the field of emerging diseases, such as long-term Covid syndrome, eating and nutrition disorders and mental health, with particular attention to the age group between adolescence and the first age group of adulthood. Mr President, allow me an inscription. Just two days ago the platform was activated on the INPS website to apply for the psychological bonus, that bonus that was so mocked when we presented it, with other colleagues in this House, to last year's budget law. [[Applause]] We have been told that it was a favor to a category of professionals and we have shouted with all our strength, together with colleagues Biti, De Petris and others, which was instead a norm that served the citizens and the country because after two years of pandemic the need for support to psychological fragility had emerged with immense force. Well, in less than two days, the demands are over 115,000 and this shows how strong that requirement was. I am very strongly asking today that the amounts allocated to that bonus be increased because we know that the existing ones will not be enough to respond to all the requests. We have to answer to everyone. We must then proceed, as already foreseen in the PNRR, with the strengthening of the network for psychological support, which must look not only at the pathologies that are already in charge, but at the whole area of fragility that has not been answered so far. The numbers of the bonus requests show how wide that band is and how right we were to raise the problem. We have also provided, with our agendas, the essential requirements for the recognition of the qualification of IRCCS, criteria for evaluation, revocation and confirmation aimed at encouraging their integration into territorial structural networks, becoming a reference of high specialisation and support for the care of chronic diseases, including through the adoption of models that provide an integrated multidisciplinary approach. We now see in all areas that a multidisciplinary approach is needed for each pathology. We said that, perhaps ten days ago, when we approved the motions on the Oncology Plan, but that is true in all areas: the approach to health can only be multidisciplinary. In conclusion, Mr President, the support of the Movimento 5 Stars for measures necessary to comply with the PNRR's deadlines will not fail. These funds have been obtained from our country thanks to the commitment and tenacity of President Conte. [[Applause]] They were used to raise the country after the pandemic, but even more so to recover decades of lack of investment and badly spent resources. All the more reason is that we need everyone, up to the last euro, in this moment of crisis. Health - we have all learned this - is a good to be protected and restored with the appropriate care and research serves to do it better today and for the future, as well as being an engine for the country. The IRCCS has the perfect combination of the two. For these reasons, I announce the vote in favour of the Movimento 5 Stars. We, for the country and the citizens, are always there and we will be there in the future. [[Applause.]]
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u217	Pursuant to Rule 120 (3) of the Rules of Procedure, I refer to the roll-call vote by simultaneous ballot of the bill, composed of only Article 1. (The vote was followed). The Senate approves. (See Annex B).
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u218	The next item is the debate on document LVII-a, No 5. The rapporteur, Senator Pesco, has requested authorisation to carry out the oral report. No comments were received, the request was accepted. I therefore call the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u219	Mr President, the Government has forwarded to Parliament the report setting out the update of the public finance policy objectives in relation to what is set out in the Update Note to the Document on Economics and Finance (NADEF 2021), already amended - for 2022 only - with the report approved by the Chambers on 20 April in the context of the examination of the Document on Economics and Finance of 2022. Article 6 of Law No 243 of 2012, the so-called reinforced law implementing the principle of balance-of-balance-sheet, provides that temporary deviations of the structural balance and the programmatic objective are permitted only in the event of exceptional events. The same article also states that if the Government - in order to cope with exceptional events - considers it essential to temporarily depart from the policy objective, after consulting the European Commission, it shall submit to the Chambers, for subsequent parliamentary deliberations, a report updating the policy objectives of public finance, as well as a specific request for authorisation indicating the measure and the duration of the deviation, setting out the purposes for which the resources available as a result of it are to be allocated and defining the plan of re-entry to the programme objective, in accordance with the duration of the severity of the exceptional events. In anticipation, the Government points out that the increase in inflation, mainly due to the prices of energy products and raw materials, the difficulties caused by the current international situation, the continuing spread of the Covid-19 virus and the repercussions of the prolonged drought period require the adoption without delay of an urgent measure to counter the negative consequences on citizens, families, businesses and the country's growth prospects. The Government also recalls the extension to 2023 of the so-called general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which allows the Member States of the European Union to temporarily deviate from the adjustment path towards the medium-term objective, although it does not suspend the application of the Stability and Growth Pact or the procedures of the European Semester on budgetary surveillance. With regard to the assumptions for intervention, the Government points out that the substantial improvement of the fiscal trend framework of the first half of 2022 implies a forecast of the general government net debt for 2022 of 0.8 percentage points of GDP lower than the estimate of the net programmatic debt carried out by the DEF, which was less 5,6%. In absolute value, debt would therefore be about ‚Ç¨14.3 billion lower, entirely due to higher revenues. These are in particular higher tax revenues of around ‚Ç¨11.1 billion, to which is added the extra-tributary component for about ‚Ç¨3.2 billion. The higher tax revenues are largely attributable to the result of the self-liquidation payments and the sustained dynamics of VAT, the latter in turn, ascribable to the increase in price inflation, especially the energy ones. Mr President, this morning the Parliamentary Budget Office reassured us and assured us that these are the sums. In this respect, I would like to highlight a figure which emerged today in the Commission: these sums which have already been collected, given the accounting laws, have not yet been entered in the State budget at the accounting level and cannot therefore be used. There is another question: it should be noted that, pursuant to Article 17 (1-a) of the Law of Accounting and Public Finance, the higher revenues than those entered in the budget, resulting from changes in developments to current legislation, cannot be used for the financial coverage of new or higher expenditures or reductions in revenue and are aimed at improving public finance balances. Therefore, it is right to ask for permission to use these resources: I would like to specify that. In view of these increased revenues, which can be found in current legislation, the Government confirms for the year 2022 both the forecast growth of gross domestic product, as well as the already authorised programmatic balances with the previous report to the Chambers of April last and incorporated in the DEF 2022 programming framework, as well as the debt-to-GDP ratio. This means that there is no need to revise the limit on the net issuance of government debt securities already authorised, which does not lead to an increase in the level of interest payments. This is also very important to remember: the government is not asking for more debt. (16.28) (Following Mr Pesco, rapporteur) The Government therefore requires permission to resort to debt: we use the word "indebtedness" because these resources are not yet usable, but there are, corresponding to the financial spaces described above for a total amount of 14,3 billion euros in 2022. These resources will be used with an urgent measure of upcoming adoption, which the Government intends to adopt to counter the effects on individuals, households, businesses and public bodies, linked to the increase in energy prices and more generally to inflation, the continuing spread of the Covid-19 and the effects of the prolonged drought period, as well as to restore the central government for the resources used to cover previous emergency measures adopted during the year. This concerns in particular the reduction of the system charges on electricity and gas, laid down for the third quarter of the year by Decree-Law No 50 of 2022. The programmatic value of the net balance to be financed from the budget of the State of competence and cash for 2022 is correspondingly redetermined in view of the effects of the measures that will be adopted with the next decree-law. Finally, the Government confirms the convergence path towards the medium-term objective (MTO), as indicated in DEF 2022, as this request for debt authorisation only covers the financial year 2022, without leading to a worsening of the programmatic balances of the following years of the programming period.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u220	I recall that, pursuant to article 6, paragraph 3, of Law n. 243 of 2012, the resolution by which each Chamber authorizes the use of debt is adopted by an absolute majority of the respective members. Motions for resolutions on the report will have to be tabled before the end of the debate.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u221	Madam President, to define the surreal situation in which we are immersed, without even realizing it, is very little. Last week, the President-in-Office of the Council left the Senate Chamber for his well-known allergy to criticism, while I was taking the floor to retort his trust communications: a gesture that evoked what would happen within hours. By remaining unavailable to any request for openness on the issues of the social and political agenda of the country, he placed confidence on a single-line resolution. It was an insult to the citizens and to Parliament as it had never been seen before, causing the situation to fall irresistibly to the dissolution of the Chambers, arranged by the President of the Republic, except to remain in office for the conduct of current affairs until the constitution of a new Government, which will hardly be ready to prepare a budget law adapted to the serious internal and international situation. The need for a new intervention in support of companies that are about to close their doors and families that do not even arrive in the middle of the month, both broken by a galloping inflation - it will be 10% - and by an economic recovery that, after the rebound last year and the doping of the PNRR is once again showing that it is neither lasting nor structural nor even less sustainable, despite the parterre de rois of Ministers and advisers of which it has surrounded, was already in the air before the resignation. It could not have been otherwise, given the unfortunate sanctions that have contributed to weakening Europe and strengthening the United States, forcing us to pay its gas, which is more polluting, at a double price than the Russian one, and to encourage speculation on the price of oil. In this crazy summer of war, Covid, drought and government crisis, is this budgetary deviation, for which Parliament's approval as well as the endorsement of the European Commission is required, compatible with the management of current affairs that belongs to a government resigned? If there is no question of the need to intervene in favour of the weakest, as it was just a few days ago when President Draghi decided, despite everything and all, to resign, it is still under discussion how much and how. The budgetary deviation for which authorisation is sought is abnormal compared to what has happened in the past, in which an authorisation of expenditure has always been required to be covered with greater deficit and debt. On the contrary, this time a forecast of general government net debt for 2022 would be lower than that indicated in the DEF. This is because, due to the rising prices of energy products and not only, it has come to create an extrajet VAT. As the Parliamentary Budget Office pointed out at today's hearing, VAT increased by 19.8% in the first five months of the year (plus 10.2 billion), with cumulative double-digit increases since the beginning of the year. In particular, the growth of the domestic trade component (6.9 billion, or 15.1 percent) has been significantly driven by the increase in prices over the last few months. In May Istat estimated an increase in consumer prices for the whole community of 6.8% on an annual basis, and VAT on imports increased by 3.3 billion (59.9 percent), largely linked to oil price developments. The development of the Irpef is also favourable. The resigning government has quantified in 14.3 billion euros the resources that can be used to counter the effects on individuals, families, businesses and public bodies, linked to the increase in energy product prices and more generally of inflation, the continuing spread of the Covid-19 virus, the repercussions of the prolonged drought period, as well as to restore the central government for the resources used to cover recent emergency measures adopted during the year. On this last point, there is to be opened a parenthesis on the actual cost of the system charges for 2022, which is reimbursed: a point that has never been clarified and that suggests that even in the previous decrees has been too allocated for this item. The first point to think about is because 14.3 billion and not more. It is a figure that arises from an assessment by the Minister of the Economy and which, moreover, seems to have been increased in the last few days, after the crisis of government. If the needs of the country are greater, and are greater, why not use the period of suspension of the safeguard clause to be allowed a greater deficit, provided that the accounts do not continue to improve until the end of the year? The other point, no less important, is: how will this money be spent? The few lines of the government's report are not enough, even in the light of what happened in previous decree-laws, to make us rest in the sense that they will be used in the best possible way and will not end up promoting once again elite and strong powers of international finance. Who will make decisions that are not proper to a Government for current affairs? Madam President, I am beginning to conclude with some considerations on current affairs. I read on the schedule of proceedings that Friday, August 5 will be under discussion the bill n. 2651, which delegates to the Government on tax reform. In my opinion, this bill exonerates from the handling of current affairs, practices almost always respected in recent decades by the governments resigning, and represents the umpteenth will of the majority with the direct competition of the opposition. I could then talk about the reform of tax law, under the direct control of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which, in addition to consolidating the prevalence of economic interests on law and constitution, puts at risk the legal principle of the separation of powers in force for three centuries in the so-called liberal democracies, with the addition of the violation of Article 102 of the Constitution: there can be no more magistrates. In conclusion, Madam President, there is no freedom if the judiciary is not separated from the executive power, as Mr Montesquieu warned. However, the Government Draghi, born with a palace agreement on February 17, 2021, after having transformed the Parliament into the Third Chamber, similar to that speech of the bivouac of the autumn of 1922, cultivating that unique thought that does not admit criticism and does not even allow oppositions to present themselves in the elections, forced as they are to collect the signatures in a short time and under the umbrellas, brings back to mind those dark years of history well described today in room Koch by Senator Riccardo Nencini in the novel "Solo" on Giacomo Matteotti. This government, condemned by the Genuflex press, will also be remembered as the worst post-war government for families and citizens choked and impoverished by sanctions. I didn't take all the time, but thank you. [[Applause]]
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u222	Senator Saccone is enlisted to speak. You have the right to do so.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u223	Mr President, to tell the truth, there is nothing that the esteemed Senator Lannotti said in this last speech that I can share. This Parliament is so free that in a bizarre way it has decided, with an action started by the Movimento 5 Stars, not to renew confidence in the Draghi Government; therefore, if we go to the vote today, it is because we live in a democratic country; if it were not, it would have been serious to continue this parliamentary term, so let's deny some campaign slogans. Let us move from the slogan of the worst government to that of the worst Parliament. Today, in fact, a leader of a party authoritatively represented in this House, but not yet in numerical terms, said that this is the worst Parliament in the history of the Republic. This is another campaign slogan: you point your finger at populisms and easy slogans and then sometimes you become victims of them. This Parliament, Madam President, Madam Undersecretary, has had the courage, even from different positions, to deal almost unanimously with the pandemic crisis and also with the international crisis in Ukraine. I would remind all of us that under the pandemic the worst Parliament in the history of the Republic has not hesitated to vote for budgetary deviations. And this responsibility was also borne by those who were in opposition to the yellow-red government. Therefore, I would debunk some commonplaces which, frankly, I do not think can bring a minimum of authority to those who say them: indeed, they lose credibility. Today we deny so many rumors that preceded the days of the most insane crisis of government. Moreover, I remind all the friends present that it has never happened, in the history of the Republic, that a President of the Council, who had obtained a large majority, resigned and had six days, six very long days, thanks to the wisdom of President Mattarella, to try to compose a somewhat bizarre political crisis. Basically, those who had to recompose that political crisis preferred to wake up or activate the last useful day, but neither: to testify that this crisis of government comes from farther than some newspaper in these days wanted to tell it. There was probably no longer a desire to move forward, because no government, in any Republican Parliament, would have lost six days to try to initiate political intercourse. This intercourse, as we all know, took place on the penultimate day, meeting the secretary of a very authoritative party, the Democratic Party. Then, out of necessity and form, the leaders of the center-right met, but by now the nut was drawn. This Parliament, the worst in the history of the Republic, is here today, now on the threshold of the beginning of the month ago, to adopt another measure in support of people, families and businesses. The worst Parliament in Italy is doing this today. Although some newspapers have stated that, in the event of the government's fall, the maneuver would be a small maneuver, of two or three billion, today we approve well over 14 billion euros. So, a little healthy propaganda, too, the newspapers have done it and they're doing it. It would be more useful, in order to guarantee a free opinion in this country, that even the newspapers, the free press, contribute in an honest and transparent way, not telling in an instrumental way the reality. Today, the whole of Parliament, I imagine, will vote for this measure, which does not affect future generations, because it does not go well, as the President of the 5th Commission, Senator Pesco, has said well. It's money, it's money that, at 80%, comes from more revenue. So the worst Parliament, as well as the worst government, are capable of drawing from those funds without increasing taxes by a cent and, above all, without indebting public funds. This, in itself, is a great achievement. It is a huge achievement, which will be affected by various measures, which I hope no one will resist. I also hope that, on the contrary, it will speed up so that they are approved quickly: EUR 200, a small cut in the tax wedge, support for businesses, support for those with precarious or seasonal jobs. The other point I make, Mr President, is that I do not know whether this measure will be sufficient. There's no point hiding behind a finger. It is inevitable and everyone is confirming this: we will have one fall of the catastrophic ones, of the devastating ones. In the meantime, I note that Istat's statistical data tell us that things are less bad than the various Cassandre were predicting in the newspapers and on television. Istat has confirmed 3% GDP growth this year. So, the NADEF presented at the beginning of this year has increased. The economic conditions, therefore, are certainly serious, but this is a country that can and wants to recover and find solutions. I do not know whether it will be necessary, in the next parliamentary term and for the next government, to draw on a budgetary deviation. The evaluation will be done by those who come after us. Of course, today we are clearly saying that, regardless of the shape of the next Parliament, Europe cannot be again the Europe of austerity. This, as a leading country of the European Union, among those founders, we cannot Let's have it. We cannot allow Europe to return to that climate of austerity in which the compass was only the economic and budgetary parameters. This is intolerable, because European friends have also shown an important solidarity with the Eurobonds, which have also been obtained by this Parliament and especially by those who are to the Government (no one denies the truth) and from those measures we cannot and must not go back. That is a Europe that no longer exists, because it would not be tolerated, not by the potentates, dear friend Lannutti, but by the peoples, because even before a narration of the stepmother Europe everyone today sees that a different Europe is standing, a more attentive and sensitive Europe, even more so in the face of an international crisis in which there has been a solidarity of politics not only foreign, but also of defence. Our hope, therefore, is that this measure will land in the pockets of families and businesses as soon as possible; the Forza Italia-UDC-Berlusconi Group President will do everything to ensure that this legislature ends, in its paradox, in an orderly manner and above all in support of which it needs most. [[Applause]]
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u224	Senator Romeo is registered to speak. You have the right to do so.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u225	Mr President, I would like to make a few points, starting with this morning's debate on gender. Even on this request, which came in these days from the Government, we could talk about a technical language, in the sense that for days it was said by some political forces that there was a need to provide for a deviation that could put resources in the field to help families and businesses, but we were told that the deviation cannot be done because we cannot do new debt. Today, however, the request comes from the Government and we are supporting, after hearing the European Commission, that the Government itself requires permission to resort to debt. On the one hand, they tell us we don't have to do another debt, and then the government makes a request for debt clearance. It is obvious - I see Senator Misses that he shakes his head - that we are not doing new debt, that is absolutely clear, but we are not even improving compared to the higher revenues and compared to what the law provides, so it doesn't really change much. We can play with words, say that it is not a deviation but a request for authorisation of debt, so it also serves the absolute majority as prescribed by the Constitution, but the substance is that. The higher revenues should be used to reduce public debt, because there is a rule, Article 17 (1-a) of Law 196 of 2009, which says that the higher revenues cannot be used for new interventions but in fact to improve public finance. In order to be able to derogate from this law, let us not reduce public debt, because we rightly use these resources, which should in fact reduce public debt, to give aid to the population, as we have always said. You can use the technical language you prefer, but in essence it's what we've been saying for months and we've been told it couldn't be done. [[Applause]] In view of the narratives that these days are heard in the debates on television, it is interesting to underline the fact that these 14 billion that will be available to help our citizens are not children of who knows which policies of the government or of who knows what miracle, but they are children of a very simple factor: with inflation and the increase of the costs of raw materials and energy, substantially the State introduced more VAT, there are no great miracles, that is the reason. And these resources must rightly be used in aid. We would have expected - this is a bit sorry, the debate is quick and quick and we do not want to waste time on the government or the country - and we would have liked a more substantive discussion on how these resources will be allocated. In fact, today we are faced with a delegation in white, in the sense that we delegate in white to the Government, which will decide essentially how to employ them. We will also have little room for intervention, because, now that the decree is published and sent to the Senate, in fact there are the month of August and then the election campaign and, therefore, very little can be done. We would have liked to have done more. We take advantage of the intervention to underline to the member of the government that, since these greater resources derive substantially, with inflation, from an increase in VAT revenues, it would be very important to use them - this is the proposal that the League made - to zero VAT on basic necessities. [[Applause]] This would mean meeting the people who are in difficulty and the people who need them the most. [[Applause.]]

On this occasion the Government thanks this branch of Parliament for the confidence expressed towards the Government through this important resolution, which - as has been said in the speeches of all - will allow us to give back to citizens resources that are, in fact, citizens' resources. [[Applause]] - we cannot do that, i.e. return them to citizens and businesses - which have contributed to the increase in revenue, as they emerge from the marginal differential to existing legislation.

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u233	PRESUTTO (IPf-CD). Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the budgetary deviation required is a further response to the needs and needs of our citizens, at a very difficult time. We are experiencing a deep crisis, determined by phenomena that have strongly changed the international geopolitical structure; a crisis that has involved and that still affects all the productive sectors of our country. Politics has a duty to provide quick and concrete responses to mitigate the devastating effects of a series of unprecedented phenomena (pre-and post-war pandemics). Italian households face a galloping inflation, a considerable increase in bills prices, an unprecedented energy crisis, while the Covid emergency remains at the same time. Our goal is to allow our country to ferry to a more favourable historical phase, ensuring that the commitments made with Europe regarding the PNRR are respected. These objectives can only be achieved by relying on the sense of responsibility that politics must demonstrate; a responsibility in terms of listening, determination, will and - if necessary - mediation, in order to really put citizens first and make them feel that politics can work at their service. With the aid decree, several measures were approved to support Italian households and companies. The Government now has a further ‚Ç¨14.3 billion treasure for support measures for households and businesses. These are the resources available thanks to the increased revenue, i.e. a debt of 0.8 percentage points lower than the estimates, as the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance has explained in recent hours, presenting the report on the adjustment to the Council of Ministers. This appropriation will not be able to solve all the problems that afflict us, but it will be able to alleviate the emergency for Italian families who have been asking us for a long time to solve their problems, effectively mitigating the recent uncontrolled increase in prices: just think of the food, whose increase has arrived, in percentage terms, to 9% since the beginning of 2022, and unfortunately may not stop. Similarly, companies, otherwise forced to close down, are also asking for this, which we must prevent. The crisis of companies invests the entire production chain and results in a deep crisis in the world of work, which must be addressed, addressing the difficult issue of wages and investing in research and infrastructure. They are all necessary measures to provide our country with a new structure, that of a country that is able to recover effectively from the crisis, to start again with a new vital momentum. In this sense, particular importance is given to the recent words of the President of the Republic of Mattarella, who stressed that the period we are going through does not allow pauses in the necessary interventions to counter the effects of the economic and social crisis and, in particular, the increase in inflation, which, caused mainly by the cost of energy and food products, has serious consequences for families and businesses. The recent political crisis, therefore, cannot stop politics from trying once again to find emerging solutions of immediate impact. Therefore, we in Together for the future are convinced that the work carried out so far by this Government must continue and that it will be necessary to resume the ranks of the current legislature in the next one, in order to carry out a series of measures that will not be possible to complete in this legislature. We shall therefore vote in favour of the resolution. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u236	CONZACTS (IV-PSI). Mr President, with this report, the Government is asking Parliament for permission to use the increased resources generated. This is not a new deviation and, in fact, both the GDP forecasts and the policy balances already used and incorporated in the planning framework for 2022, as well as the debt-to-GDP ratio, including the path towards the medium-term objective, are confirmed for 2022. The financial spaces of which we are asked to use are generated by a margin, because the net tendential debt has improved its own development compared to the programmatic one. The resources that have been generated are 14.3 billion euros and are important resources, at this time, that will be used - as a proxy that the President of the Republic has given as margin of operation to the Government - to respond to the four very serious crises that we are experiencing: famine, therefore the food crisis, the energy crisis, the climate crisis, with drought, and the pandemic crisis. In particular, the decree-aid law- bis, which will be issued by the Government in days, intervenes on a very important topic, which concerns the wheat crisis and the food crisis, and important interventions are being studied, I believe also interesting, such as zero VAT on bread and pasta. It must be remembered that the increase in the prices of bread and pasta is generated by the blockade of exports by the silos of Ukraine, caused by the invasion of Russia, and the risk is reduced. Despite the agreements that, thanks to diplomacy, have been closed, opening a channel for marketing, there are considerable risks compared to new attacks. Let us remember the last missile attack on the ports of Ukraine. But we must also bear in mind the situation of Europe's barn, where the war has destroyed machinery and all the potential of agriculture, polluting land and above all aquifers, undermining the prospect of future export. This is why the reduction of VAT on bread and pasta could be an interesting intervention even in structural terms. A second intervention that will be contained in this decree-law will obviously concern the dear energy. Despite the great efforts and the latest decisions - even the G7 has today confirmed its intention to put a roof at the price of gas - the theme remains central and very serious. Russia continues to threaten Europe and Italy, with the shut-down of North Stream and, therefore, our energy transition and our independence from Russian gas must be as fast as possible. In the meantime, the measures already contained in the aid decree must be renewed. The decree-aid law- bis that will be financed is objectively important: 14.3 billion euros that are added to the 33 billion already allocated from the beginning of the year by the Government Draghi. However, it serves the current character: these are current punctual interventions, as well as currents are the powers that this resigning Government has. At the worst moment, we have gone into the worst situation, depriving ourselves of the instruments that could, on the other hand, see us today adopting a measure that would give light and strength to a real reform to combat inflation. We must instead approve, with this new authorisation, a bill for the conversion of the decree-law aid. A week ago, President Draghi had proposed to us, from those scranni, a decree-aid law- bis, that would contain a further reduction of the tax wedge (further compared to the 7 billion already approved in the budget law for 2022) and a reduction of the contributory wedge, after the billion already approved in the budget law. It is clear to everyone that for low incomes little work can be done on the tax wedge (there is no tax capacity) and rather work on the contributory wedge. President Draghi had proposed to us to work on the redefinition and strengthening of collective agreements, also to bring to cover, and therefore to regime, the minimum wage also for all those who to date are not covered by collective bargaining. Some of the forces in this Parliament have responded to this very important proposal, so we have our hands tied today. We can certainly make an important and useful aid measure, but not the real reform that we could have been called upon to do and for which the country would have greatly thanked us. Of course, our vote in favour of the Article 6 report, which anticipates the use of resources compared to the adjustment in the Update Note to the Economic and Financial Document and the margins generated by the differential between tendential and programmatic debt. These margins, within a framework of good public finance despite everything, derive from two main components: a component generated by indirect tax revenues, in particular VAT - as has been said - driven by inflation and rising gas prices, but also a component generated by a reduction in expenditure, in particular for social shock absorbers, thanks to the economic push and the recovery of the labour market. Our GDP for 2022 remains confirmed at DEF levels, at 3.1 percent, so there has also been a reduction in expenditure. On the other hand, the macroeconomic framework remains very critical of the DEF, because GDP growth, from here on, will hardly be confirmed given the contraction of markets also at international level and the situation of the energy crisis. We have a double problem related to the price of energy, which drags inflation upwards, and an even bigger problem of quantity. Already in the DEF a forecast indicated that, in the case of quantity restrictions, our economy and production would suffer directly, with a reduction of 2 percentage points of GDP. This is a perspective that must in every way be avoided and that is why the European Union has approved plans for storage and joint purchases, but also - a few days ago - a measure probably of epochal scope: I am referring to an energy rationing programme that starts from 1 August 2022 and arrives until the end of March 2023; a plan that describes the immense gravity of the situation and that has been voted favorably by all European countries, with the sole exclusion of the usual Hungarian leader Orban. Italy Viva voted in favour of the Article 6 report with a great deal of concern for Italy, which decided to become more fragile at the most serious and even guilty moment. I say blamefully not from the political point of view - politically, unfortunately, everything is legitimate - but with respect to the interests of the country. Italy has deprived itself of one of the most authoritative governments in the world when it needed maximum internal stability. Mr President, the report, which we will vote for, is tight, but we ask the Government to continue working on the social agenda and on the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which is the only major measure that can keep the levels of GDP growth up to our large public debt. For this reason, too, there is no new deviation. These were and remain our programmatic lighthouses and, therefore, Italy Viva will be in support of the Government until the end of this troubled legislature and even after. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u239	Mr Calandrini (FdI). Mr President, with regard to the report before us today, we have the same attitude as we have in the past when, for example, we have approved a series of deviations that have led this country to borrow EUR 200 million. Before we go into the substance of the report, I would like to make some general comments, because today we are adopting a measure which is the first in loose Chambers. The proof is that the early end of the legislature is absolutely not leading to the country's paralysis, and the report we are approving today goes in this direction. For months it has been said that voting was now irresponsible and many of these accusations have been directed against our political strength, which is the only one of opposition. It was said, in fact, that there were the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and various decrees in expiration and that it was necessary to combat inflation, the expensive bills, the increase in the cost of raw materials and everything that could lead to the increase in prices that there was. Imagine if we of Brothers of Italy were not in the front row when we talked about defending and securing our Italy system. For months, however, we were told that nothing could be done with the early vote. Today, on the other hand, in loose chambers and with a government in office only to deal with current affairs, we are here to vote on a report to give the Commission permission to resort to debt that is in time. This debt, in fact, is only because there is no budgetary adjustment, which is in the House of Deputies, and it must be voted on. Therefore, when there is final approval in the other branch of Parliament, the anticipation of EUR 14.3 billion will in fact become a simple round. This is the first time we have voted on an act without any debt to our children. Let us tell the Italians the truth, then: it is not true that there is paralysis, because there is a government in office, there is a Parliament still in office and it will be until the next Parliament is established scheduled for 13 October. So, those who told the opposite were obviously lying knowing they were lying. Colleagues, it is not a question of irresponsibility, but of political will: if you want to act for the good of the Italians, you do so without stirring ghosts or ghosts, and the measure we are discussing today demonstrates this. Real immobilism, on the other hand, is not that of the few weeks that divide us from the vote, but it is that of the past months and years, with a pandemic that destroyed the country, a war that has inflicted a further hard blow to our economy and a dear life that has come overpoweringly to crumble Italian companies and families. In the past months we should have given answers and been as efficient as we are today, with a decree that arrives in the Chamber to be voted in record times: the real irresponsible are not us of Brothers of Italy, who asked to go to the vote; the real irresponsible are those who in recent months have kept the country in check, hostage of the internal quarrels of a majority that has crumbled and of cross vetoes of the parties that have played on the skin of the Italians. This was, unfortunately, the real reason that broke down Italian families and businesses. In order to restart the country it was therefore necessary to turn the page and dismiss this legislature born badly and ended worse, in which three majorities turned out to be a communion of parties that had nothing in common; totally inadequate and heterogeneous majorities to face the challenges that history and the circumstances have proposed to us: a terrible economic crisis triggered by a violent pandemic, a war at the gates of Europe and now a galloping inflation. Fortunately, in a few weeks all this will be just a memory, because Italians will have the opportunity to choose a coalition that is not a mixture of everything and the opposite of everything only to gather votes, but, on the contrary, a communion of programs, objectives and intentions aimed at giving the country back the greatness it deserves. This is our wish to which as Brothers of Italy and as center-right all of us are working. In order to enter into the substance of this measure, today we allow - as I said before - a temporary debt of EUR 14.3 million, which we will not leave to future generations. We agree to make this effort, but provided that this time the resources are used - as reported in the report signed by President Draghi and Minister Franco in black and white - to help, yes, this time, families, businesses and public bodies to counter the price increases of energy products, to combat inflation, the consequences of the continuation of the pandemic and the consequences of drought. We agree, Undersecretary, that this time the amounts of the extratragettito that we are receiving as a result of the increases of all these goods and services will be returned to the Italians through the aid that will be given with the next decree. With the measures contained in the measure that we are funding we hope to see concrete interventions and no longer - as unfortunately happened in the recent past - tips, bonuses and prebende, which have turned out to be only palliative. We want to see VAT cut on basic necessities. We want to see the excise cuts on fuels extended and the social charges for electricity and gas bills cancelled. We want to see the tax credits on bills extended for energy companies, thus correcting also the mistakes that prevented companies from taking advantage of this last important facility. What we do not want, Undersecretary, members of the Government, President - let us say clearly, as we have already denounced in the recent past - is that these 14 billion are used to finance some of the electoral districts, as happened in part with the 200 billion that have disappeared in a thousand streams. Too many resources have been wasted in these years of pandemics. Let us ensure that at least this last provision is not used to do the interests of someone, but rather to be aimed at the true common good. We would not like to be in this House in a few weeks to report yet another gift to friends and friends of friends. If that happens, we'll sue him heavily. Therefore, our vote - as we have always said - today will be in favour not of a government that we have opposed in every way, not of a majority that has melted like snow in the sun, but of a measure that goes in the direction of doing what has never been done so far: really helping the Italian people. Of course, we are aware that the 14 billion and some further extension will not be enough, because many problems must be fought at the source, but this is no longer the task of President Draghi, it is no longer the task of this Parliament, it is no longer the task of this Government. The new Parliament and the new Government, which must be an expression of the Italian vote, will take care of this. Waiting for all this to happen, we are sure that on this measure and for that little time remaining at this legislature you will find - as has always been - the willingness of Brothers of Italy to work and to legislate on everything that goes in the direction of helping our system Italy. As I have already announced in the premises, the vote of Brothers of Italy will therefore be favorable. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u242	Errani (Misto-Leu-Eco). Mr President, I would like to say that the electoral climate echoes here and there. This is not a real deviation, as Mr Calandrini said. Simply, since it has not yet been possible to enter the largest revenue, this instrument is used to immediately make the measure relating to the second aid decree: therefore, nothing to do with the reasoning on the deviations proposed just now. After that, it is always very difficult to make the citizens understand exactly the technical procedures for managing this phase. The important thing is how the 14.3 billion will be used, and that is what I want to dwell briefly on. We are presenting a resolution - as was inevitable - which records the report presented to us by the Government. We are not in a position to write a resolution in which indications are given, because the political moment is the current one. I would, however, like to say two things: the first is that these resources are certainly not enough to deal with the problems we have. I do not subscribe - as a senator said before me - to the Cassandres, but uncertainty, starting next semester - as the Parliamentary Budget Office has told us and all analysts tell us - is real. For example, compared to what we have recorded through VAT, and first of all the increase in energy and the resulting increase in VAT revenue is not to say that next semester we will have the same results. We do not know what the dynamics - hopefully positive - of Europe will be. If Europe does not get the idea of moving forward with the political and - for me - strategic choice of the Next generation EU; if we go back to the discussion of the restart of the Stability Pact, we would certainly find ourselves in very serious conditions. I hope that this will not happen, but there are certainly some issues that we need to address now and we need to do so selectively. The resources we have at our disposal are not enough to cover all the needs. And I quote some of the priorities that seem fundamental to me. The first is to find the smartest ways to respond to the already existing social crisis, as President Draghi said in yesterday's meeting with the social forces and unions. This is a priority and in relation to it there are additional priorities, first of all among all the incomes that have least grown or even lost purchasing power. The second fundamental choice is how we help small and medium-sized enterprises that are crushed by the problem of credit. From this point of view we need - in my opinion - not an umbrella measure, but a punctual one, which costs much less and corresponds to the objective that is being set. The third priority is the issue of tax credit with regard to superbonus 110, in relation first and foremost to what all the groups in this House have stressed, namely those businesses, those families and those blocked citizens. A fourth issue is that of local authorities and the cost of energy, where I put the question of health and the regions. We must strike a balance between these priorities by not giving in to illusions or pressure to make general and generalist measures that risk not solving any problems. I understand very well that the Government is resigning and, therefore, that these choices would require that political force that has not been behind us in the months now. However, the problem is so clear and clear that I hope that the Government, by confronting all the parliamentary groups - there are no more majority and opposition - in order to avoid being able to discuss in the Commission on flag amendments that obviously could not go anywhere, can identify the priorities mentioned in a serious, transparent way and explain them to the country. I believe that this is a service to the institutions, to the country and - as President Draghi said - to the Italian people; it is a service that this Government owes to the Italian people and to the whole country. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u245	MANCA (PD). Mr President, undersecretary Sartore, ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic Party will vote on the resolution annexed to the report that has been presented. However, I am obliged, for as many truths and responsibilities as we have always expressed in this House, not to be silent in the face of the need to make clarity, because truth is a cornerstone of the quality of democracy. We must therefore make it very clear that the content of this report and the issues that we have to deal with make it even more explicit that some political forces are irresponsibility, due to an allergy to government responsibility. I heard Senator Lannuti call for an allergy from President Draghi to listen to Parliament: there was an allergy from some political forces to put first the country's interest in the need to rebuild a block of power [[Applause.]] The objective of some political forces was in fact power, while that of others was to openly manifest an allergy to government responsibility. I do not need to add much more, because the report that has been presented in this Parliament, which will be evaluated by the House and the Senate, clearly shows that we are faced with high inflation as probably never before this country has gone through since the post-war period to the present day; to a dramatic international context, with the war that is still being perpetrated and extending in the times and the ways in which it happens; to the increase in energy costs. If we then add climate change and everything they are producing in our country, starting with the great issue of drought, we see that this is not compatible with irresponsibility, nor with the choices that have already been made. I do not wish to reflect on the past, but I cannot accept that today, in order to deal with these issues, we would need a government in its full capacity and, above all, a Parliament that had the conditions to be able to intervene on the legislative level, as the law gave us. On the other hand, in the face of such high challenges, we have made another solution prevail in this House, on which I do not want to return. However, I am obliged to highlight the responsibilities and the fact that we probably needed a government in full office today even more than yesterday and, above all, a Parliament that could add useful guidelines to the definition of decree-laws. The Government is responding in full to the words of the President of the Republic, whom we want to thank, because I believe that in this country it is necessary to stress how important the credibility of the institutions is. I turn to President Romeo to say that the Government is not asking for a new debt here, because we must also bring out this truth. We are not faced with an increase in net debt, because all the demands for deviation to debt - there is no need for extreme competence in the economy: they are the fundamentals of politics - without the construction of a European framework, with inflation at 8-9 percent and probably higher - it is a factor not only Italian, but also from other continents and countries in the world - are not compatible with a net debt action without coordination of European economic policies. Therefore, we are not asking for a budgetary deviation in order to make new debt: we are simply authorising the Government to use the greater revenues that have been determined also because of inflation (in particular on VAT revenues, IRAP and more) without having had the time - the budgetary adjustment has been prepared before and is under discussion in the House - to proceed to a consolidation in the accounting system of the State for which we will need an amendment, to resume the public finances balances, after the authorization that we are giving to the Government for the use of resources. This is an urgent operation, indispensable for Italian families and businesses; we are not in the presence of new debt. I have never heard Mr Calandrini think that the new debt is a fundamental element for the younger generations. [[Applause]] Debt is a huge problem and allowing a deviation is one of the most delicate and difficult responsibilities and prerogatives of this Parliament and cannot be done often, in the name of political demands or party demands for polls or to manage consensus. With high inflation the new debt would not be compatible with holding and government finance balances. If we go to see public finance balances too, it is thanks to the government's credibility and the ability we have had to react to the pandemic that we have kept low interest rates. So, for keeping low interest rates here, we probably have additional resources available today. It is clear that this is the starting point. And we cannot use phrases that do not correspond to truth, feasibility and responsibility, which, especially in loose Chambers, a Parliament must highlight and demonstrate. So, actually, colleagues. After that, there are urgent interventions that will be defined by the government in the next few hours, but we want to make it clear that there are priority elements. There was a meeting with the economic associations; this morning there was a meeting with the social partners. We need an important initiative to safeguard social cohesion. I say this very clearly. Probably, in a different context, with the Chambers and the Government in full of their prerogatives and functions, we would have made an additional intervention to demand the reduction of taxes on labour, a substantial intervention on the tax wedge, to increase wages, to reduce in a structural way the cost of labour for businesses and to guarantee an extra monthlyity. The problem is not solved by lowering VAT; the problem is solved if we increase the purchasing power of wages and guarantee to families and above all to people, including pensioners, a hold on purchasing power in the face of price increases, which is unsustainable and risks pushing many families into loneliness and poverty. However, I tell the government to be careful. Probably, with respect to these resources so urgent that they are allocated, the priority must be to safeguard social cohesion. We carefully assess why, together with the necessary tax credits to safeguard the functionality of companies, in the face of the needs that we also have to ensure a contrast to the increase in energy costs, we must take care of Italian people and families, especially those with low incomes, who pay the highest price of an unsustainable increase in inflation. Of course, I ask the Government to pay particular attention to this, so that the drafting of the next decree takes account of the social dynamics that trade union organizations, together with the Government, have defined today. The second particularly important element is health care. We went through a pandemic. There are regions in this country that struggle to close the balance. We risk jeopardising the maintenance of the universal health system. On this issue, in the possible ways and terms with the urgent decree, I believe that the Minister for Health and the Minister for Economic Affairs must find a solution. We need, probably, some resources, but more important would also be to lighten the weight of the budget balance, with a coating of the costs of the Covid-19 going beyond the year. These are all elements that safeguard the social estate of our country. The basic objective, as requested by the President of the Republic and as I know to be to the attention of the Government, must be the safeguarding of social cohesion and the country's keeping, preventing conflicts. That is why we will vote in favour of the resolution, maintaining a profile of total responsibility: because responsibility, for the credibility of the institutions, is not compatible with lies and not even with exploitations. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u248	DAMIANI (FIBP-UDC). Mr President, undersecretary Sartore, fellow senators, I would like to use a few minutes to express some concepts and to bring back to the centre of the political and parliamentary debate the emergency situation that we thought and hoped to throw away a few months ago with the exit from the serious economic crisis due to the pandemic. Unfortunately, we have met again, because of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, in a period of economic crisis that is difficult to overcome. Our companies, our families and our companies are still very exhausted by these different situations but that have always led to a serious economic crisis in our country in recent years. It is therefore time to put the concept of emergency back at the centre, and that is why we too are here today to express this need. It is our duty today, in an emergency, to continue to support economic aid for our businesses and our families. [[Applause]] It is still difficult today to think what the future might be, because there are still many unknowns. That is why we all need to express a favourable opinion today on the use of these resources. We are here to approve this report which makes available to the Government more tax revenue that is needed and which must immediately be used for an emergency measure along the lines of all those measures that we have approved so far, which we want to call them support, relief, aid and aid- bis. We need to approve this report today and make additional resources available for EUR 14 billion precisely to continue to inject liquidity to support companies and households. If we also consider the new financial and monetary policy measures of the European Central Bank, with a restriction on credits, it is clear that we are in a perfect storm and the situation becomes difficult. There is no point in discussing this much whether it is a deviation or not, because today we need money, in this case, to support our companies, as I said, in this situation of difficulty that the European Central Bank also places on us. So let us welcome this EUR 14.5 billion. Whether they are a deviation or not, we must give back to the Italians these resources, because they are the taxes that have paid extra in this first half of 2022 and we must give them back to them in a moment of serious difficulty that we all know is due to the crisis and all that it has determined, from the increase of the bills to the crisis of the resources, reducing the purchasing power of the families at the moment of economic recovery that we were experiencing. It is therefore necessary to make proper use of these resources in favour of companies and businesses. We at Forza Italia have always said that. I want to remind all the famous 100 billion a year and a half ago, when we asked Parliament for 100 billion detours to help our country; we really did 200 billion and we did well at that time of trouble for our country. [[Applause]] , because if today there has been economic recovery is precisely because we have used those 200 billion euros that have given us the opportunity to survive our companies even if they were closed and therefore, at the time when the country is divided, we have given them the possibility of economic recovery. This is the main motivation that led our parliamentary group, our party, to support these emergency measures. We have put our interests and the interests of the party ahead of us, thinking of the interests of Italians at that particular moment. We have done this with great consistency because it is the mission of Forza Italia at this moment and it has been the mission of Forza Italia in these years. The approach we must take, therefore, must be focused on economic growth and development, which are the DNA of our party. We must demonstrate this not only in times of emergency, but we must begin to look at what the future of our country must be, because, after this phase of crisis (I hope as soon as possible), we must start looking at the structural reforms of our country. It is enough to put dust under the carpet; we must move on to tax and labour reforms, to the reduction of the tax wedge. [[Applause]] These are the things that we must do, and this is the teaching that the economic crisis must give us today, before the pandemic and today the crisis of war. We must look with perspective and also with confidence at the future of our country. We have long been committed to this; we have also been the bearers of the proposals for reform that I have just mentioned in the government action we have taken in this year and a half. Today it is necessary to approve this measure and it is necessary to provide additional support resources; at least we must stop the erosion of the purchasing power of Italians, trying to continue to give support to our companies. For this reason we are willing to support today this resolution and this use of resources, which we finally give back to the Italian people, who still paid them with the extra taxes they paid. We look at the prospects and future prospects of important reforms. Tax reform is crucial in order to continue to support our businesses. Justice is another important issue, which will serve for the development of our country; then there are investments in infrastructure. We must complete the PNRR in the coming years, because those are also fundamental resources that will help us and are helping us today in the economic growth of our country. These are the messages. We have also brought our proposals to the so-called aid-a decree, which will reduce VAT on basic necessities (we are also in favour of this proposal). We therefore vote in favour, because, when it comes to Italians, our companies and development, Forza Italia is always on the same side. [[Applause.]]

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u251	RIVOLTA (L-SP-PSd'Az). Madam President, on the report to Parliament by the President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, pursuant to Article 6, the Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will vote in favour of the debt claim for a total amount of 14.3 billion for 2022. Most of these resources derive from the increased VAT revenue resulting from the dynamics of imported energy prices and the rise in inflation, which is about to exceed, as estimated by the International Monetary Fund, 6%. We are deeply concerned about the fate of Italian citizens, our communities, their present and their near future. More resources must be unlocked without delay to support individuals, families and businesses in order to counter the effects of inflation, the increase in energy products and the effects of drought and to prevent the country from falling into recession. Those who have been careful have heard that practically every Group has repeated the same things; the arguments and priorities are the same for everyone. It is necessary to reduce the tax burden on labour, the real burden that cripples business growth and rising wages; therefore, cutting the tax wedge is essential. There is also a great need for extraordinary fiscal peace, a pact with taxpayers that allows the State to recover resources that are otherwise impossible to collect, to be allocated to measures to support the income of individuals, families, municipalities and regions. In a few days, by 8 August, more than 500,000 taxpayers will have to pay all the installments of the break-up-b for 2021, in order not to lapse from the facilitated definition; instead, the installments relating to 2022 will have to be paid within four months, by 5 December. We believe that immediate action is needed through a review of the installment plans, so that everyone is in a position not to succumb. Just look at the numbers of house sales and auction halls: they are a very worrying index, which describes very well the dramatic effects on the lives of normal people. Another priority is to continue to take action on the transfer of the building tax credit. Strong action is needed on energy prices and to counter the effects of drought. It is also important to act to support the purchasing power of households and it is essential to zero VAT rates on basic necessities. [[Applause]] The timing is tight, the sharing of the stringed resolution, made by all the Groups, beyond the necessary distinction on the priorities of each individual Group, is the best response of the Senate to the emergencies of the country and to the needs of the population, families, small, medium and large enterprises, local authorities, who are in a desperate situation in the formation of budgets, and of the Regions, especially for health, for what will be the development of the pandemic in autumn, but also for all the structures and for the speech related to the energy efficiency and energy consumption of the buildings of health care. I therefore repeat the vote in favour of the motion for a resolution. Mr President, allow me to express my special thanks to the Undersecretary Alessandra Sartore. [[Applause]] It has followed with attention and professionalism all the work of our Budget Commission and the work in this House. [[Applause.]] (17.47 a.m.)

ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u254	PELLEGRINI Marco (M5S). Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Government, we are obliged to be clear and clear with the citizens and to tell them that today we are about to vote is not a real budgetary deviation. We are not deciding to do extra debt, to make investments and to help those who are now in trouble, families and businesses above all, because of the crisis caused by the pandemic first and then by the war. No, we are simply deciding to use the higher tax revenues that were calculated on 30 June 2022. I'm not saying it, actually, but the government says it in its report that was delivered to us today. In particular, on page 4 it informs us that the sums we are discussing today and that will be used in the aid-a decree amount to 14,3 billion euros and that they derive, precisely, from greater tax revenues of 11,1 billion euros, from self-liquidation of taxes and from greater VAT revenues caused by the increase of the prices of the energy and the consequent increase of the inflation. Now we are using this money: no more resources. It is therefore not the deviation that the Movimento 5 Stars has been asking for for for months. There has not been that reversal of the tendency to that accountantistic approach, which, in our opinion, has characterized this Government. Therefore, micro-helps have continued to be foreseen, without facing the problem with determination, with foresight and above all with competence. The report we are dealing with today is a punctual and plastic snapshot of the lack of courage - I regret to repeat, but I have to do so - that today too has marked the government's going on, as in all these last months, and that as Movimento 5 Stars has led us to take a very clear position on the aid decree. [[Applause]] Yet, if we go back a few months ago, we remember the scenes of jubilation by the Government, Parliament, analysts, economists, opinionators, "journalists," journalists and in particular entrepreneurs, who rejoiced when the GDP figures for 2021 were released, in which we recorded a record increase of 6.6 percent. This is the best figure in Europe. [[Applause]] It is a result - I will never tire of saying it - son of that courage, which today is lacking and which instead was in the most difficult months of the pandemic by President Giuseppe Conte and his Government. That Executive, between March 2020 and January 2021, at a very dramatic time for republican history, was able to put in place deviations for a total of 130 billion euros. But those - I want to point out - were real deviations, real investments and a real social and economic protection network for both citizens and companies. [[Applause]] Without being entangled by the usual fundamentalisms and fundamentalists of the Brussels accounting rules, those acts of courage avoided the collapse of our manufacture and prevented the birth of dangerous pockets of social distress in the very hard period following the lockdown. That strong push to our economy lasted until 2022, by admission of the same Franco Minister of the economy, which in front of the world economic Gotha of Davos had to point out that there was a drag effect on GDP 2022 greater than 2% thanks to all that had been done by the Government Count II. Basically, on that occasion Minister Franco told us that this country is afloat for everything that was done during and thanks to the Government Count II. Unfortunately, that state of emergency is far from over, because the Covid has not been defeated at all and the crazy invasion of Ukraine by Russia has literally put all the political and economic scenarios of the West under control. I remembered before that for months the Movimento 5 Stars asked Prime Minister Mario Draghi and his Ministers more incisive interventions to support families and businesses and for months we have asked to stop being accountants and resume to do good politics, the one that quickly and well solves the real problems of citizens, companies and craftsmen. The money, Draghi said, you don't take, at a stage like this you give. Do you remember that phrase? This statement, with which he presented himself to the Chambers, filled us with joy and we applauded it with all the others. However, these clear positions have unfortunately not been followed up. It was therefore decided to continue with a low head, making ears as a merchant in front of every urgent need. I would like to add a comment on the reduction of VAT. We are all very happy that this operation is being carried out. We talked about it before Easter and we had asked everyone to do it. Unfortunately, he did months later, losing precious months. [[Applause]] Obviously at that time it was much easier to listen to those who said that it was necessary to completely abolish the income citizenship, that - I remember - in the last two and a half years has instead given way to the Italians more in difficulty to put together the lunch with the dinner, as they have recognized all the organizations that deal with marginality and fragility (Save the Children, the Community of Sant'Egidio, Caritas and other organizations, but also important economists). Everyone recognized this, except for a few sectors that are on my left, which continue to do this foolish campaign together with the Renzians. [[Applause]] The economic crisis triggered by the pandemic in this 2022 has unfortunately worsened further and added to the disastrous consequences of the outbreak of the war, as I mentioned earlier. Over the last six months, we have been calling for us to abandon the short-breath policy of microaid; we have been calling for a decisive fight against speculation that has skyrocketed prices of both basic goods and those that are needed to produce. We fought for a net cut in the tax wedge, which had to be the first step to counter the loss of purchasing power by millions of families. Debates have been wasted, with opinions to the right and to the left, but nothing or little has been done. We thundered in front of the country - and we are proud of it - on the impasse of our bill on minimum wage and I am glad that President Matrisciano is next to me. [[Applause]] It is the only concretely structured proposal to put an end to the chronic hunger-wage illness of this sick labour market of ours. That law has been in force for months right here in the Senate, unfortunately since 2019, for the government's failure to reach opinions. A government that, in the face of the real will to give the country the minimum wage, has never managed to get out of this cone of smokyness; we do not know what it wants to do: so many chatters, proclamations, but nothing concrete. And in the meantime there are many citizens and many citizens who are offered salaries from hunger, indeed from slavery, of 300 euros per month, with hourly wages of one or two euros per hour. [[Applause]] We asked to raise the level of taxation to all those giants who are making avalanches of money with this economic picture, also thanks to the crises triggered, because in the crises not everyone loses us, there are also those who earn so much! In this case too, the government's timidity, and taxes on so-called extra-profits have reached a level that we consider to be absolutely insufficient. (17.55) (Pellegrini Marco followed). It seems to me useful to enter again - I just mention this - into the debate on the superbonus 110%, a mechanism which, as we are all certain now, does not please this Executive, in particular President Draghi and Minister Franco; On the contrary, they have never made a mystery of their aversion to this measure and just last week the President of the Council himself reiterated his thought in a contemptuous way on this measure, not remembering that a study of Nomisma a few days ago, taken, for example by "Il Sole 24 ore" and by other newspapers, that are not of the area of Movimento 5 Stars (because there is not even one!) [[Applause]] has certified that, compared with 38 billion investments, the country system has had a benefit of 125 billion. This was our policy for companies. [[Applause]] That was beyond the talk we heard in four and a half years. [[Comments]]

I want to conclude by saying that we love this country, we love Italy, and that is precisely why we do not even escape our responsibilities today. Let us not abandon the citizens and businesses that are in a dramatic moment, but let us not really call it a deviation or a change in the budget because, by paraphrasing the prince of Salina, who perhaps knows - but I am not sure - with this measure everything varies so that nothing varies. [[Applause. Comments.]]
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u257	We shall therefore proceed to the vote on the motion for a resolution on the report to Parliament drawn up pursuant to Article 6 of Law No 243 of 24 December 2012. I would remind you that this resolution requires an absolute majority of the members of the Assembly, so that the vote will take place by electronic means by simultaneous ballot. I therefore refer to the roll-call vote by simultaneous ballot of motion for resolution No 1, tabled by Senators Missa, Rivolta, Dell'Olio, Damiani, Errani, Conzatti, Presutto, Steger and Calandrini. (The vote was followed). The Senate approves. (See Annex B).
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u258	I'm asking to talk.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u259	You have the right to do so.
ParlaMint-IT_2022-07-27-LEG18-Senato-sed-456.ana.u260	FOURTH (M5S). Mr President, in this speech I summarize an appeal from the Italian Committee of the International Association of Hydrogeologists on the current serious problem of drought. The largest water resource of the Italian territory is groundwater, which guarantees 84 percent of the hydropotable needs and a significant part of the agricultural and industrial needs. Italy, by virtue of its hydrogeological characteristics, has such an abundance of groundwater as to represent an invaluable economic resource, also for its excellent quality compared to surface water. Groundwater is immediately available in many contexts and offers long-lasting solutions that are not dependent on water crises, provided that the potential of aquifers is carefully assessed and the effects of withdrawals are constantly monitored. It is therefore logical that the optimisation of national water needs and consumption should first move from a careful evaluation and a conscious use of groundwater, as well as from a correct water saving policy. In fact, the alternative artificial invades as well as being fed by rivers, in drought crisis, are more vulnerable to pollution. In addition, in an emergency phase, both massive interceptions of water that is defluent in rivers, which can alter river ecosystems, and cementing that consumes soil, are avoided. We therefore invite all those involved to reconsider the central role of groundwater and the professionalism of hydrogeologists in the planning of short and long-term interventions, so as to quickly ensure the formulation of effective and cost-effective responses to water crises and established climatic trends. I would like to conclude with a heartfelt appeal that the next budget law should finance the Carg (Geological Cartography) project. [[Applause]] , which also provides for the realization of hydrogeological maps that give light to what by nature is invisible, but for us it is an invaluable treasure. [[Applause.]]
