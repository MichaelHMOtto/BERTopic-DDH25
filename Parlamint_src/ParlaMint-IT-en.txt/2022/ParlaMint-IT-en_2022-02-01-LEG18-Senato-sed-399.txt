ParlaMint-IT_2022-02-01-LEG18-Senato-sed-399.ana.u7	LANNUTTI (Misto-IdV). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the general prosecutor of the Court of Auditors and the prosecutor of Rome, they are investigating the posthumous approval of the CIPES, after the proposal of the ministers Giovannini and Franco of the plan on Autostrade, despite the contrary opinion of the same Court and the Authority of regulation of the transports, in recent days the same CIPES, presided by President Draghi, has given the green light to an operation to lose, with the State that puts us about 8 billion euros donated to the Benettons, those same lords of the tollgates that have managed the Italian highways, the hen from the golden eggs, collecting rich dividends without doing maintenance, causing the tragedy of the Morandi bridge with 43 dead. "The Treasury has called": the pressure of the Minister of Economy to pave Autostrade to the usual funds. One source reveals to the weekly TPI the pressures of the Ministry of Economy to favor the operation CDP Atlantia: "Ministerial officials called to invite interested parties to step aside." Title of 12 November 2021. On this operation, which has recorded missing documents, with potential competitors to whom no indispensable information has ever been provided, an open and then suddenly closed date room, pressure of the Treasury - as Laura Maragnani wrote on TPI - even, in order to discourage possible buyers in a "matty operation" that the State is leading to acquire Autostrade for Italy (Aspi), I have submitted numerous questions. A transaction that revolves around 88.6 percent of the shares in Atlantia, the company in which the Benetton family plays the part of the lion, buyer the HRA consortium, consisting of Cassa depositi e loani (51 percent) and Blackstone and Macquarie funds, at the price of 21.3 billion euros, compared with 13.8 billion that would cost the withdrawal of the concession. How were the partner funds of the operation chosen, the American Blackstone and the Australian Macquarie (whose advisor is Claudio Costamagna, former president of the CDP itself)? I shall conclude by thanking you, Mr President. 43.52 percent of Atlantia's shares that the state now wants to acquire are in the hands of two U.S. funds, Vanguard Group and BlackRock, which are in turn one of the other's owners. Blackstone's main shareholders are Vanguard Group and BlackRock, and they are still the biggest shareholders of the Macquarie fund. In other words, Vanguard Group and BlackRock come out of the window with the mega liquidation of Atlantia and come back from the door with the new consortium, while Aspi, a strategic company for Italy, is controlled by foreign funds. Thank you again, Mr President, and I ask the Government to answer these questions, also to honour the memory of the 43 victims of the Morandi Bridge.
