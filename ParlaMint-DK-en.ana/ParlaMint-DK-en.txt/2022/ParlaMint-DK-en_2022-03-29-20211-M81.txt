ParlaMint-DK_20220329132114	The debate is open. Sir. Male Larsen, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329132127	Thank you very much. Russian unjustified military aggression against Ukraine and Belarus's involvement in this aggression are acts that are contrary to both international law and the principles of the UN Charter. It undermines our European and global security and, above all, stability. This must have consequences, both for Russia and also for Belarus. The European Union has introduced a number of restrictive measures and sanctions against Russia and Belarus as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Belarus's role in this respect. This also applies to restrictions on the sale of euro banknotes and securities in euros, in which the European Council has prohibited the sale, supply, transfer and export of banknotes in euros and has also prohibited the sale of securities in euros to Russian and Belarusian nationals or other persons residing in Russia or Belarus. However, this does not apply to the Danish krone, which is outside monetary cooperation. As a result of the Danish fixed exchange rate policy towards the euro, the Danish krone can in some cases replace the euro in some currency transactions and can therefore contribute as a kind of substitute currency for the euro. With the bill here, we will support the Council's restrictive measures and help to make circumvention of the ban more difficult by imposing similar restrictions on cash and securities in Danish kroner, as is also the case for cash and securities in euros. The legislative proposal here must be seen in the context of the fact that the Commission has already committed itself to an extension of sanctions, which will include the other EU currency, including the Danish krone. However, since we do not know at this stage when the Commission will extend sanctions, we in Denmark want to ensure the effectiveness of European sanctions and introduce similar measures for the Danish krone. The bill imposes restrictions on the sale of cash and securities in Danish kroner corresponding to the European sanctions. This means that we are imposing a ban on all sales, supplies, transfers or exports of cash in Danish kroner to Russian and Belarusian citizens and other persons resident in Russia or Belarus etc. It is also proposed that it should be prohibited to sell transferable securities in Danish kroner, as well as units in collective investment undertakings providing exposure to such securities to Russian and Belarusian citizens, as well as other persons resident in Russia or Belarus, etc. Finally, it proposes to introduce the possibility of sanctioning infringements of the prohibitions with fines or imprisonment up to 4 months or in particularly aggravating circumstances with imprisonment for up to 4 years. The prohibitions are in line with the measures adopted at Union level in relation to the euro. The Social Democratic Party unreservedly supports the restrictive measures and sanctions of the Government and the Council against Russia and Belarus in the light of the aggression of the Russian military forces against Ukraine. Against this background, the Social Democrats can support the bill here. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329132436	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we go further in the line with Mr Beazley. Torsten Schack Pedersen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329132444	Thank you. Sanctions must be stronger. That was the message from President Zelensky in his speech to us here in the Folketing a short time ago. And I cannot agree more, because with Russia's attack on Ukraine, we are in a changed world, we are in a changed Europe. We have assumed a clear responsibility on the Danish side to help the Ukrainians, we have donated weapons, we have sent money, we have collected money throughout the country, the Danes are helping Ukrainian refugees throughout the country, and Russia has been met with the toughest sanctions we have ever seen, and they need to be tightened further. The European Union has adopted a large number of restrictions and, in the case of specific legislative proposals, these include: prohibiting the sale, supply, transfer or export of banknotes denominated in euro and prohibiting the sale of transferable securities denominated in euro to Russian and Belarusian nationals or persons residing in Russia or Belarus. We are not in the euro, so these rules do not apply directly to Danish crowns, and it cannot be the case that Danish crowns that follow the euro completely, should then be an instrument by which Russians and Belarusians can circumvent the sanctions imposed by the European Union, and therefore there is full support from the Left for the legislative proposal to ensure that the restrictions imposed on currencies vis-à-vis Russia and Belarus must of course also apply to Danish kroner; Danish kroner should not be a way around the sanctions adopted. We also think that there is a good connection in the fact that the penalties are actually quite serious, but it is also necessary that we not only adopt sanctions, but also, of course, that we are very, very tough on the fact that violations of them are severely punished. I think we all found it very moving to hear the President's speech, and I think the call for us to tighten the sanctions and the sanctions to be strong must be addressed, and we must work together for that, and I would urge the government to do so. This is not, of course, a call that is really necessary, because I know that in this situation we are in a state of perseverance in the fight against Russian aggression, the Russian invasion, the Russian war against Ukraine, and that is why we must tighten the sanctions as much as possible, and we must ensure that the sanctions imposed jointly are, of course, effective, and that is why we support the legislative proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329132808	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. This means that we go further in the rapporteur's line to Mrs Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen-Nielsen, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329132817	My colleagues have explained the proposal, which is self-evident and necessary, because of course we cannot have our currency used to circumvent the sanctions that are necessary to push Russia as much as possible. We have all just heard President Zelenskyi speak to the Folketing, and he clearly asked us to do more. The Russian economy is, as it looks right now, an economy that is being used to kill men, women and children, destroy Ukrainian cities, drive people out of their homes and send millions to flee. That is why we need to do more, and that is why I am spreading my speech here a little, because in the SF our position is that, despite the great consequences it will have for Denmark, for the Danes and for the Danes' economy, we will have to do more on top of the historically harsh sanctions imposed on Russia. This is an historic moment and, as Zelenskyi says, the Ukrainians are not only fighting for themselves and for their lives and their homes; they are also fighting for Europe and European values. That is why we need to do more. We need to shut down the Russian gas. That's SF's position. In relation to what we are discussing today, it is quite clear that we cannot use Danish kroner or securities to circumvent the sanctions adopted in the European Union. But I would also like to bring up something else. Because when we try to push Putin and the oligarchs and the Russian economy, we have to look for the loopholes that exist. And there we just have to say that cryptocurrency is the blind partner in the game; it is a very, very easy way to send money out of the country, and it is an area that is completely unregulated. The large companies and platforms trading in cryptocurrency have refused any form of cooperation to make the sanctions work. This is something I think we need to discuss, because it is a way of circumventing the sanctions that we are doing right now and which have very major consequences for ordinary Russians too. I hope that the Minister will say a little about this when he also comes to the floor. One last thing from up here must be that we also need to do much more now and in the long term to combat tax havens. There is no doubt that some of the world's richest people are Russian oligarchs and they have their money in tax havens. There are jurisdictions around the globe that make a living hiding blood money, drug money, money from murderers, prostitution, money laundering and other things. That's what they do for a living, and they still do away in good health, despite the fact that we've been trying to make some restrictions. Now we just see that apart from the fact that we will not accept that you do not pay your share in taxes, it is also billions and billions and billions of oligarch money that are being hidden away in these places. That is why I think it is right and proper to talk about it today, namely that there is no extra effort being made there. I very much hope that the Danish Government will go to meetings in Brussels and say that we will also have to take action; otherwise, these historically harsh sanctions are only hard on paper and not in the real world. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133213	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. Mrs Katrine Robsøe, rapporteur for the Radical Left, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133227	Thank you. It is, of course, quite timely in many ways to stand here and, at this moment in time, to stand in this Chamber with an urgent legislative proposal, after all of us have just heard the Ukrainian President speak. To make it absolutely clear: of course the Radical Left also supports the bill here. It is quite obvious that the Danish crown should not be used as a way of circumventing EU sanctions. With the fixed exchange rate policy that we have in Denmark, it would be an obvious way of getting around the sanctions that we fully support, and therefore, of course, we also support the bill here. We cannot look silently on the sidelines of the Russian side at this time, the war in Ukraine, and therefore the restrictions both on Belarus and Russia are also entirely appropriate. That's it. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133328	Thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur I see in this Chamber is actually Mrs Mona Juul, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133349	Thank you for the floor. I'll be very brief. Conservatives are, of course, for all relevant and all sorts of sanctions against Russia and their invasion into Ukraine. It is important to turn words into deeds, and now that the European Union has made legislation on trade in the euro, we must of course close the gap with the Danish crown, of course we must. It can only go too slowly, and the only thing I want to spend my time on today is to read through the bill thoroughly so that we ensure that no mistakes have been made. It can happen when there's a hurry. But then I am sure that we will have the opportunity to vote in favour of this proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133427	Thank you to the rapporteur, no brief remarks. And that means that we move on to the next rapporteur, Mette Hjermind Dencker, the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133443	Thank you. After all, we have just heard the speech by President Zelinsky of Ukraine about the terrible attack and what it means for Ukrainians to be exposed to it every day. And that's quite, quite horrible. After all, we get pictures of it from the press every day, and it's terrible to think of all the innocent people, children, elderly people and nursing homes, kindergartens and hospitals being bombed. And all we can do to weaken Russia in all this and to help Ukraine, of course, we must do. After all, it is a terrible, brilliant attack, not just on Ukraine, but on the whole of the West, so we shall never put up with it. With strong restrictions, we are strengthening Ukraine. After all, this selling and delivering euros and securities is something that the European Commission has now banned from doing in relation to Russia. And, of course, it is clear that Russia's next move will, of course, be to look at those EU countries where we are fortunate enough to be outside the euro. So it is clear that the Danish crown will be next, which they will probably try to do, allegedly. So, of course, we have to lean on the European Commission here. And, of course, we must adopt the same ban, which also applies to the euro. So we in the Danish People's Party are entirely in agreement with that, and we fully support it. So the more we can do to weaken Russia and the more we can do to bring about early peace in Ukraine by tightening our grip on Russia, the better it will be. That is why we hope that this is just one of the very, very many measures that we will be deciding on in the near future. Because we really just have to continue to sanction everything we can, so the Danish People's Party we just hope this is the beginning, and that we can tighten our grip more and more, so that hopefully there will soon be peace in Ukraine. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133655	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. Then it's mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133658	Thank you. I do not think we should take this bill up to the heights and say that this is what is going to reverse developments or something, but it may be a small contribution which will help to preserve and strengthen the restrictions on Russia. We must, of course, back that up. This is an urgent legislative proposal, so we will also spend the day watching whether there are some things to which we have some questions, and we will then send them over to the Ministry so that we can get them answered and so that we can get it voted through as early as this week. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133734	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. Then we've come to Mr. Knox's office. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133740	Thank you. The Liberal Alliance supports the restrictions imposed by the western world on trade with Russia and the consequences thereof and also the suggestion that the Russians should not be able to save their money by buying foreign currency. It is important to understand that in most countries, even if he is very powerful, he or she cannot hold himself in power without the support of dominant groups in the country from which he or she rules. The restrictions here affect the Russian people, and that is what is meant to happen. The Russian people must understand the consequences of the Russian people's backing for Putin's regime, which is why restrictions must be imposed that affect Russian companies and Russian citizens. It is also their responsibility that they hold Putin in power and that Russia wage war against the outside world. That is why we support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133856	There is a brief comment from Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133900	I hope it is okay that I just put a question on the edge of the issue here, but when I hear from the Liberal Alliance rapporteur that we have to do everything we can to hit Russia's and Putin's economy, does this also mean that the Liberal Alliance thinks that gas should be turned off to Europe?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133919	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133920	Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133926	Then we would like to thank the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. And then we've come to sir. Jens Rohde, KD.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133933	Thank you. There is nothing more true about it being repeated, so I should just like to say from here that we support the legislative proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133943	Thank you to the rapporteur. It was accurate and short. Then we've come to the minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329133955	Thank you very much for your comments on the draft law, and thank you very much for the broad support that we have for the urgency we have now and, of course, for the very positive reception that the draft law has received from the rapporteurs. It was not many minutes ago that the words of President Zelenskyi of Ukraine roared right over here in the Landstingshall. I think I am speaking on behalf of everyone when I say that the words made a great impression. It was very touching to hear a direct speech from Ukraine to Denmark in the Danish Parliament and directly to the Danes from a man under siege, a leader whose country and population are hit by an evil war. The words are also a direct reminder that we must help where we can. The harsh economic sanctions are a strong weapon against Putin. That is also why we are discussing this bill today. With severe sanctions, we have together in the European Union put an iron curtain over Russia's economy. We have among other things. to sell cash and securities in euros to Russia and Belarus, but right now we run the risk of our Danish crown being abused as a kind of substitute currency when you cannot have the euro. We do this because the Danish krone is tied to the euro because of our fixed exchange rate policy. In other words, we run the risk of the crown being abused by Russians who want to circumvent EU sanctions. We must remove that risk immediately, because sanctions must hurt, and they must continue to do so. With the bill we are now discussing together, we are ensuring that the same restrictions are imposed on the sale of cash and securities in Danish kroner as apply to cash and securities in euro. And we ensure that the sanctions for a violation of the law also reflect what applies at EU level. Therefore, an infringement could be sanctioned by fines or imprisonment up to 4 months or in particularly aggravating circumstances up to 4 years. For me, it is important to say that the war has a price. We're all gonna feel that. But the war's greatest price must be paid by Russia. We have a responsibility to ensure that. That's what we're doing with the bill here. In those words, I look forward to the further urgent consideration of the draft law.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134318	There is a brief comment on Mrs Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134320	Thank you. Will the Minister for Industry comment on some of the points I raised in my speech, particularly in relation to cryptocurrency? We know, of course, that a number of the very large crypto platforms have been asked whether they will help to ensure that kypto currency does not become a way for Russian currency to flow under radar in relation to sanctions. To that the answer was clear: no, we would not cooperate on that because it went against the crypto-thought, so to speak. This is potentially a place where, precisely because we are blind to it, a lot of money can flow out of Russia, and sanctions are thus avoided. And the sanction tool, as the Minister rightly said, is an opportunity to press Putin to stop the war.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134419	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134419-2	It is important that the sanctions we apply jointly in the European Union and with our allies work, and that is why we must close the possibility of circumvention of the Danish crowns here. And, of course, it is also important that cryptocurrency is part of the way we think about sanctions. Today, the Russians on the list of sanctions are not allowed to trade with bitcoins or with other cryptocurrencies. Similarly, it is also forbidden to trade in sanctioned goods, even if you pay them with crypto currencies. So some steps have been taken to ensure that cryptocurrency does not also become a possibility of circumvention, and I think that is the way it should be. So it's important that we have a look at it, and I think that's something we should keep focusing on through this difficult situation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134510	Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134511	So the Minister for Industry can guarantee when, for example, there is no guarantee. is a subsidiary of a Danish bank, Lunar Bank, which is a cryptoplatform, despite the fact that Danish authorities recommend that you do not trade in cryptocurrency, and that you are not under the supervision of the FSA in this area... that Denmark cannot be a bypassing place for Russian money flowing out... so that Denmark can not with the sanctions here be a place where Russian money can flow through via cryptocurrency?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134549	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134550	I mean, what I'm saying is that when there are goods you can't trade in, you can't even pay with crypto currencies. And if you are a Russian who is on the list of sanctions, it does not matter whether it is crowns or crypto currencies, then the same sanctions apply. I think that, with the help of the FSA, we can clarify the specific case that is being asked here, and although we are in a hurry, there is also the possibility of questions being asked which can be answered before we come to the third reading. For me, it is just important to say that sanctions work best if they cannot be dealt with, and we must also ensure that with the Danish crown, just as we must follow the crypto currencies.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134630	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief remarks and no more have asked for the floor, so the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. Are there any comments? It has been adopted.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134641	The debate is open. Here you go, Malte Larsen, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329134652	Thank you. Social media play an important role in most people's everyday lives. In many ways, they have added new opportunities for experience to our everyday life. We can get in touch. Yes, we can be in contact with other people almost always. In social media childhood, infancy, we embraced them almost unconditionally because we were fascinated by what the media then enabled us to do. Unfortunately, we also see that a lot of illegal content is now being added to the social media • content that can be hurtful or offensive, content that delivers the individual or violates society's general ground rules for respectfulness. Yes, we have seen very young people abuse their deeply personal information for blackmail. Finally, we have seen people steal their identity and be the object of dishonestness or crime. It calls for a political response. It's all too easy for the platforms to excuse themselves that they're just platforms. With the bill here, the government will strengthen the demands on social media and help fight illegal content on their platforms. With the initiative, the government has presented some initiatives aimed at making the platforms responsible for contributing to the fight against illegal content on social media. It is therefore also the first initiative of the initiative to strengthen the focus on the responsibility of social media in relation to illegal content, which the draft law here deals with. So the government wants to take power back to the citizens. The bill contains a number of obligations to service providers that offer a local communication platform or group message service in Denmark and that have had over 80 000 users on average in Denmark. Specifically, it is proposed that the covered service providers be obliged to establish a user-friendly procedure for notification of content and handling of notifications. In other words, social media platforms are required to establish transparent processes for notifications and their handling. In addition, it is proposed to require service providers to process notifications and to oblige them to remove, block or maintain notified content within 24 hours of receipt of a notification. In the case of a notification requiring further examination, the time limit may be extended. The service providers are also required to state the reasons for their decision in order to enable the parties concerned to have the decision reviewed. It is an important bone in strengthening freedom of expression and opposing the removal of legal content. In addition, it is proposed to sanction service providers who breach obligations. Social media have come to stay. Nevertheless, we must also ensure that legislation follows developments in society. This also applies, of course, to the illegal divisions that social media platforms have become the source of. That is why, of course, the Social Democratic Party can support the bill here. This is a good and important step towards protecting users, not least those children and young people who can easily be caught by people with evil or bad intentions. As parents, we have a great responsibility, but when children and young people are violated to such an extent as they do today, we must take political responsibility upon ourselves. The government is doing that today, and I really appreciate it. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135023	There are brief comments. First, it's from sir. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135027	Will this bill, if it is voted through, remove more completely legal expressions on social media?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135040	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135040-2	As I read this text here, it is precisely the case that, within a period of time, it is possible to assess whether that content is legal or illegal, and that is why, as I also say, it is not the idea that legal content should be taken down in any way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135100	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135101	No, I know. Sometimes it's not the idea, but that's what's gonna happen in action. When you set a rule that it's only 24 hours and then it has to be removed, and when these companies can't get through all of these things in 24 hours, they have to remove it out of necessity so as not to get a fine. So I ask again: will this bill remove more legal statements from the citizens?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135125	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135126	That is not my view.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135129	Mrs. Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt, SF, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135131	Thank you. I also think it is a good step that we are finally moving forward with regulation, but some of what I miss is that, in relation to the statements that are in the grey area, that is, what is not clearly illegal, there is some sort of independent body or supervision, something that can assess in fundamental matters, whether something should be removed. I mean, I'm missing something that can also assess the content side. Will the rapporteur help to look at this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135202	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135203	Is it not already the case today that if something is illegal, it will be assessed by the authorities that exist for it? Do we need an extra institution to deal with this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135217	Mrs. Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135219	Yeah, I actually think we do. Because that would have had to be presented to the courts in the extreme, and the rapporteur knows this as well as I am a very laborious process with a long waiting period, and it may not be possible to wait for this if you have a very, very fundamental matter, either as a victim or as the one who has put out the phrase. That is why I believe that there is a need for some people to be able to decide quickly whether this is okay and that should be an independent body.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135249	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135249-2	First of all, as I say in my speech, this is an important first step in terms of what needs to be done to regulate these platforms, which have so far been unregulated or simply had to comply with their own codes of ethics. Let's see where things are going. I am confident that this will be an important first step in taking down illegal or offensive content.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135312	Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135314	When Mr. Mrs Larsen answers that it is not his view that this will lead to the removal of more legal statements from social media, and I have to say that I simply do not believe that Mr. Malte Larsen has such a naive view that he thinks it shouldn't happen. I just think that sir... Malte Larsen says this because he wants to put the bill in a good light. When the bill threatens draconian punishments for social media that have not been removed within 24 hours, which may, perhaps, not be illegal, then it is predictable for anyone who has circulated in the head that it will of course lead to social media removing more than what is illegal for security reasons, because in case of doubt, if they do not remove it, they may be punished very draconian. Well, that's the way it is, and it's got to be, sir. I'm sure Malte Larsen wouldn't mind. Sir. Surely Malte Larsen cannot just stand and say that he does not see it as it will clearly be perceived.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135412	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135413	Or that these platforms will put in the necessary resources to deal with the task they are now being entrusted with.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135421	Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135422	That, sir. Malte Larsen says social media has to do is impossible. There are so many reviews every single second of statements on social media that some others claim are wrong or illegal that social media cannot browse all these reviews manually, but instead must have some automatic procedure that would rather remove too many than too few, because the penalty, if they remove too few, is huge. So, of course, that leads to what Mr. Malte Larsen says it won't lead to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135455	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135500	I have no comment to make on that. It was more of a comment from the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135501	Then it is Mrs Mona Juul, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135505	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur. The rapporteur mentions that this bill will take power back to the citizens. In what way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135512	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135513	Well, precisely because we are getting some funding to make it possible to notify illegal content and thus have it taken down, and that the platforms that way around need to ensure that what they actually present is their responsibility, and they have the goal of getting a better democratic culture and conversation on their platforms.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135532	Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135533	However, does the rapporteur not agree with me that there is already an opportunity to take illegal content down and that it is actually illegal to throw on something that is illegal? And in the same context, of course, I would like to ask you something else. The rapporteur mentions that this bill strengthens freedom of expression. In what way? I want to ask you again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135555	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135558	There were two questions. And I have to admit, I lost the first one. But for me it will be a strengthening that you can start to express yourself more confidently on the Internet when you do not have the same risk of getting, let us call it a filthy bucket poured into your head if you get to express yourself on social media.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135618	Then it's mr. Jens Rohde, KD.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135620	It is absurd, what we are witnessing here. I just have to say, and I didn't really want to use such a pretty sharp expression... that this is the biggest attempt to attack freedom of speech since the Muhammed crisis. Speaking of the Muhammad crisis, imagine if we had had that debate there. Who would then sit and make these deletions of what was thought to be completely horriblely communicated by Jyllands-Posten, but all of whom today support that Jyllands-Posten should do. I can just say as the political rapporteur on the Left at the time: there were not many, and certainly not the Socialists, who supported the idea that such statements could be made in the newspaper. So, is it some underpaid Indian in Meta or employed on Facebook, or what do I know to assess what is legal under Danish law and then take it down within 24 hours?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135733	Thank you. Then we'll get an answer. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135735	No, it's gonna be the platform's responsibility.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135739	Sir. Jens Rohde.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135743	Yes, that is the responsibility of the platforms, and so we have privatised our legal system. They shall assess the legality of an event or statement within 24 hours. Is there anyone in here who can imagine a trial settled within 24 hours? This is a violent attack on freedom of expression. This is a violent attack on people's legal certainty. I think that the government should sit down in the payroll again and think about it and perhaps not go alone and perhaps think about whether we should try to make this happen at least with the EU legislation under the DSA directive that is on the way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135822	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135825	Unfortunately, the remarks made here by the rapporteur do not seem to me to be very much in the perspective of the citizen • the offended citizen, who is at risk of having something exhibited about himself, which may not be right, stolen information, identity or anything else. And that is what is important to us, that is to say, that the citizens can travel safely here and that people who have not yet had the responsibility are given responsibility for the conduct of a democratic conversation on their platforms.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135859	Anne Honoré Østergaard, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135859-2	I hope that the rapporteur can hear that there are many of us who stand and are very concerned about the government's legislative proposals on freedom of expression. Basically, we in the Left believe that there is a lack of discussion of freedom of expression. I just want to quote what is now being imposed on these platforms. They must go in and regulate what is called illegal content, and it is termed any content that is contrary to the law in force at any time. That means everything. All our laws, all court cases. Do we not risk making our platforms the Danish courts?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135947	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135948	No, hopefully we will get it out of it that the platforms take their responsibility and start regulating the conversation that is taking place on their platforms.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135958	Anne Honoré Østergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329135958-2	But is the rapporteur in no way concerned about what it is going to do about freedom of expression? Is the rapporteur in no way concerned that too much is going to be taken down? We agree that it is unpleasant to have a filthy bucket poured into your head, to use the rapporteur's own words, but what is it going to do about our freedom of expression?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140022	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140022-2	I think we will have a better and prettier conversation, where the same nuances can be expressed in such a way without having to scold each other, which is so easy behind the screens of the Internet. Today you have written things or expressed things you would never do if you met people on the street.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140045	There are no more brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur and move on to Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140110	Thank you for the floor. The main purpose of this bill is that all illegal content should be stopped on Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and other social media. According to the government, it has not succeeded in getting social media to protect victims of illegal content effectively enough. The great media giants such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and many more have had a huge impact on our democracy and on our freedom of expression. Social media have given us all access to the public debate and created a platform for citizens to come into contact with each other and with us politicians. Facebook alone has over 1.5 billion users every day, and four out of five Danes have a facebook profile. I think we all agree that social media should not be abused to spread terrorist propaganda, child pornography, fake news or hate speeches. Basically, it is always the person who uploads something on social media who is responsible for the legality of the content. We in the Left agree that it cannot stand alone because there has been a discrepancy between the extent of illegal statements and the number of cases actually pursued. This has also been expressed in the report by the Freedom of Freedom Commission. The bill places social media responsibility for removing illegal content much faster than today. In fact, according to the bill, no more than 24 hours should be allowed until illegal content has been removed from the social media platforms. If the time limit is exceeded, it can result in a very high penalty. In the Left, we are concerned that the platforms for circumventing the very high fines will remove far more content than they should, which will go beyond freedom of expression. The Institute for Human Rights agrees with us on this. In the Left, we are concerned that it will be private companies that will assess what is legal or illegal on social media. The short deadlines for removing content will cause service providers to make massive use of algorithmic control tools and to a lesser extent are employees moderators. This opens the way for the content to be taken down on a flawed basis. We risk undermining the democratic dialogue. We know from similar German legislation that 84.5 per cent. of the legal complaints received by YouTube are invalid, inadequate or simply incorrect. We are nervous that we run into the same problem where legal content will be removed. For the Left, it is essential that we strike the right balance between the removal of illegal content and the prevention of accidental restriction of freedom of expression. In the Left, we agree that service providers should be obliged to remove clearly illegal content within 24 hours, just as is the purpose of the EU Digital Services Act, DSA, where social media service providers must remove clearly illegal content within 24 hours. DSA aims to ensure uniform regulation in the EU, which makes good sense in a digitalised world with global media users across borders. It is not clear from the draft law whether it is temporary regulation until DSA is in place, and the draft law we are discussing today therefore has a sunset clause. If that is not the case, the draft law leaves us with no answer as to the value of going Danish alone in an area where common European rules are being voted through. In the Left, we are very aware of the problems that exist on social media and we support regulation. We also support the need to guarantee the legal position of the victims better than we do today, but we also need to have a solid basis on which to stand, and that is why we are looking forward to the work of the committee, where we need to continue working on the drafting of the legislative proposal. Because you have to remember one thing: the good thing about freedom of expression is that in that way you can find out who are idiots.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140514	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140518	Thank you for your speech and also for the agreement that we should do something. I can, of course, hear that the rapporteur has read what the Freedom of expression Commission has written, and can the rapporteur also confirm that this is leaning on the German model and that what the Freedom of expression Commission actually concludes is that there have been no challenges in terms of freedom of expression in Germany?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140540	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140540-2	That depends on what you read, because as the rapporteur was able to hear in my speech, it has been shown in German legislation that in 84.5 per cent. of the complaints that have been made, there has been something to come up with, and that means that they have been wrongly taken down. So there are some major challenges with this bill and with freedom of expression, and we see a huge problem in that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140605	Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140605-2	The Freedom of Speech Commission concludes that there have been no problems with freedom of expression in Germany. I think we'll just have to hold on to that. In relation to complaints, we actually wanted in the SF to get some easy validation of complaints, so that people do not complain in a harassment or groundless way and such things, because I could imagine that could also be a weapon in this context. Was that something the Left wants to take a look at?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140630	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140630-2	Well in the Left, we're ready to look at a lot, but the problem with this bill is that we don't think that the government has hit the dial, and that's simply because we're afraid that the platform is going to remove too much legal content, and then we have a huge problem in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140651	Then it's mr. Jens Rohde, KD. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140651-2	Well, when you have not yet concluded anything in Germany, it is because there are cases at the Karlsruhe Court that we just have to keep that in mind and it usually takes quite a long time to assess such cases. Now we ask some private companies to assess, for example. freedom of speech within 24 hours. If it goes through the justice system at home, it takes approx. 600 days with a racism case. I mean, is that proportional? No, I would even say that it is asymmetrical. I would just like to ask the rapporteur of the Left to confirm that we have concerns about the freedom of expression expressed by the Council of Lawyers, Dataetic Council, Justitia, Danish Industry, Danish Business, IT-B and the Institute for Human Rights.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140746	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140746-2	I would like to confirm that. There are strong concerns and not just on the Left side.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140752	Sir. Jens Rohde.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140753	No. It's okay.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140759	Thank you. And then it is Mrs Mona Juul, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140800	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur. As a follow-up to the SF's question, I would also like to ask the rapporteur whether it can be confirmed that Danish legislation goes much further than German legislation does. After all, German legislation is about hate speech, which is a clear challenge to democracy, but what is on the table here applies to large and small and doubtful and all sorts of other things. That is the very big difference, which is why we cannot compare the two.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140830	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140831	Now I am only a professional lawyer, so I do not have to take too much care of a long legislative proposal, but I would like to confirm what Mrs Juul says, namely that this is about all applicable law, all legislation, everything has to be done, and then you have 24 hours to find out if this is a problem, and that is a problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140853	Then we would like to thank the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. And we move on in the rapporteur's line to Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329140910	Thank you. Today, we are discussing the bill to ensure that illegal content is removed from social media. We are quite satisfied with this in the SF because, as the first party, we actually proposed a model and it is more than 2 years ago that we could see that the victims, such as the United Kingdom, have been killed. was affected by the sharing of offending material, was very weak. They just had to watch while the contents were in the open, and when they were looking for help, they ran the root between many different authorities without finding the help entirely. And we just know that time is crucial if we are to stop the spread of illegal content, because the longer it is there, the greater the possibility of having it downloaded and spread, and then it will be really, really difficult to get rid of. And it goes without saying, it's no good. After all, we must insist that the law is observed, both in the physical world and in the digital world. And we just have to recognise that social media have, of course, been given a very central role in our democracy. This is where our conversations with each other are increasingly taking place, which is why it is also important that social media are a safe and secure place to be, and I think that as politicians we have a responsibility to ensure this. I think it is the case that social media have been allowed to live a little in a legislative vacuum and that therefore there is a need to update the legislation on the platforms to suit the digital reality we have today. And that's why I think it's actually good that we get rules and have them made here in the Folketing. That is a step forward, because we need them. However, we think it is a little narrow and that it only regulates a small corner of the many challenges we see on platforms and social media, and of course we are concerned about that. We have had a good dialogue with the Minister in the run-up to the proposal, and we have also met with some sensitivity, and of course we would like to express our thanks for that. But there are still things that we would like to see different. The draft law exempts the decisions of the platforms from independent redress, and this seems to us to be a clear deficiency in the proposal. It should be possible to verify the decisions to remove content according to its own guidelines at the substantive level. And that is why it would also be obvious to have an independent council or an independent Board of Appeal which, with a judge at the end of the table, can assess specific and fundamental matters as to the type of content to be removed or not removed. Such a body seems to us to be central to the protection of citizens' legal certainty and freedom of expression, but it is currently lacking in the legislative proposal. And so does the right of access to decisions to remove content and the explanatory statement. I would say that it is not an insignificant issue that is being raised from the right today about freedom of expression. We also think it is very important to pay attention to this. Unfortunately, the platforms today also remove a great deal of content according to their own guidelines. I think it's 4,000 pieces of terrorist-related material per hour. I think we can agree that this is obviously illegal content. But in future they will have to do it according to Danish law, and of course freedom of expression should be central to it. We also believe that the draft law lacks a requirement for the service provider to be obliged to inform the police in very serious cases where obvious serious offences are complained of. As I said earlier, things need to move fast in this type of case, which is why there should be a direct hotline for the police. Then I have not mentioned the issue of digital child protection, which is not part of this bill, but which we hope will come. Age verification, cessation of behavioral design, collection of data from children... we find this in SF to be absolutely key elements. I hope that we will have a dialogue on this at a later stage, because there is no doubt that we in Denmark are very far behind when it comes to protecting children digitally. In other words, on the positive side, it is good that we are now getting started, even if the proposal could be improved. After all, legislation is better than nothing. We also have a number of amendments to the proposal which we expect to table as an amendment. Last but not least, I should like to say from the Enhedslisten, who cannot be here today, that they also support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141336	Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Jens Rohde, KD. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141336-2	Surely no one can disagree with the fact that illegal content must be taken down and removed from the web. But that is not what this legislation is going to regulate. It regulates all the gray areas. So how do you actually achieve your goal of capturing the power of the tech giants by allowing them to play an even greater role than they do today when they are to be judges of freedom of expression? And how can we prevent all the free debate, which we suddenly understand in the Social Democrats, from being confined to people who are ready for infringement? Because we are, in fact, already where we agree that we remove all the illegal content, but it is in relation to the grey areas that we go in and do something that becomes arbitrary.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141449	Here you go, rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141451	Now I think we need to get the debate back on track. What the bill says is that you have to comply with Danish legislation. I don't think anyone disagrees with that. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that there are cases in addition to those with obvious illegal content, which should just not be there. It's terrorist-related material, child pornography, etc. Then there are a number of elements that lie in the grey area, and that is why we in the SF think it would have been better if we also had an independent board which could, like it, take a position on some of the very fundamental matters. But it is the case that social media already today, according to their own guidelines, are removing tons of material from social media. Now we're just asking them to comply with the law. I think that is actually fair enough.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141538	Sir. Jens Rohde.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141539	I am so keeping the debate on track, I should like to say hello. I have been dealing with media policy and all this for many, many years, and I have been working on these issues in the European Parliament, both on the legal aspects and on the practical aspects of this, and I have been dealing with copyright law. So I'm definitely looking at it, but there's just a lot of layers in this, and it's in relation to the insulting devices, i.e. the ones it doesn't think it's nice to be spoken ugly at, that I think it's said that the end justifies the means, so we go in with the big tanks. Sorry about the picture here. Maybe it's not so appropriate in this time. And start doing something that really limits your freedom of speech and my freedom of speech.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141631	Thank you, sir. Jens Rohde, and now we get an answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141633	This proposal should not, of course, restrict freedom of expression in the sense that what we are asking for is compliance with the law. And in this legislation, there is freedom of expression. Where there may be doubts, there is a longer period of time for the proceedings so that it can actually be decided. And what the legislation in Germany has actually led to is that Facebook has employed far more moderators and far more lawyers. I think that a little shows that they take more responsibility. However, I would have liked there to be an independent board which could also take a position on grey areas cases.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141710	Then it's mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141712	It is true that Facebook today removes completely legal material and legal phrases, and that is a problem. But what this legislation does is to say to these tech giants: yes, it's a good idea for you to do it, and now you're going to have to get rid of something more so that you can be sure you won't get caught, otherwise you'll get a fine. So Facebook will certainly remove more legal material than they already do at this time. Does the SF at least recognise that it is a restriction of freedom of expression that more legal statements will be removed when companies are forced to do so by threatening them with a large fine if they do not remove everything?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141754	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141756	So, it is not our intention that legal statements should be removed; they should be allowed to be there. I think that what the bill is concentrating on is all that is illegal. That is why I think it is quite essential that we have some legislation. Perhaps there is also a difference here in relation to me being a legal rapporteur and Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen is the business rapporteur, because I actually meet some of the victims that things keep standing there, i.e. Facebook is not responding. Now I say Facebook, but it is really a broad collection of social media. So now we are giving the victims a tool to get rid of some of what is actually illegal and should not be here, and I think that is important. Is that a perfect model? No, I don't think it is. And that is why I would also like to propose this, and I hope that you will, Mr President. Lars Boje Mathiesen wants to help us make an evaluation of this at least so we can see how things are going. - Yes, sir. Lars Boje Mathiesen is right, or am I right? The future will show that, but it is certainly important that we have some rules.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141903	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141904	The distinction is probably going more than I am a freedom rapporteur, while Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt is a socialist, and that we are safeguarding freedom of expression in this, while it does less to the socialists. That's probably where the line goes. I agree that sexual violations and such things as are illegal must be eliminated, but there is nothing real here to protect the accused. Companies can have their pages removed and posted. There is no right to compensation and compensation if legal material is removed. So there is only focus on one side; it is incredibly one-sided legislation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141942	Thank you. Then it is the rapporteur to answer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329141944	So I do not want to be sitting on me because I am not concerned about freedom of expression. I certainly am, but I am also concerned that we are helping the many victims, and that is where I think that Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen owes an answer to: What are the people to do, who experience insulting content with themselves, who are shared on the social media that cannot be taken off again and who martrate them for the rest of their lives? Where should they go if it is that they have no formal rights to have something removed? I would like an answer to that. I haven't seen any other right-wing solutions to helping these people. There is such a lack of law enforcement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142019	Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142023	Social media have all kinds of reasons to want to remove illegal material. They have a moral duty to do so, and they also have a desire to create pleasant forums where you want to be, and they don't want to be a home of crazies that scare everyone else away. Well, that's a commercial reason for it. They also have a fear that there will be this kind of legislation that they want to counter by doing things themselves. So they have all sorts of reasons for it, and I actually think they are doing a lot of work, and they are doing so much work that sometimes you also think they are removing a little too much, compared to what they had to do. What is really the basis for believing, when they are already very preoccupied with this and are already removing a lot of people, that this bill will not lead them beyond an abyss, where it gets even worse and where there are ordinary people who can't say quite ordinary things, because in case you have to remove it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142122	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142123	I mean, I think that where we have a little leash in it, there is more time to look into the difficult cases. What the Commission of the European Communities has already stated was that the German model has not had any significant problems in terms of freedom of expression, and I think that is also worth holding onto. But freedom of expression is important and it is central. And that's why we have to keep an eye on how this is going on. That is where I think there may be some weaknesses in this proposal, because I would like there to be something more impartial about looking into some of these matters, and I think that will be a little difficult to ensure here. But that should not stop us from getting started. It leans somewhat towards the German model, and we can see that it has worked quite smoothly at least when you read the report by the Freedom of Freedom Commission on it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142222	Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142223	Yes, there is more time for the difficult cases, but that is to say, even with enough time, the difficult cases in Denmark are only finally settled and decided when a court has ruled on them, and only when the court has said that this is the way it is, does everyone know that this is the way it is. So you ask some to assess this, and if they do not judge correctly, in relation to what the courts would have said, they get a huge, huge fine. And of course that means they're going to erase more than they do today. I think it is so strange that one can stand on the platform and say that it may not lead to it, because it does.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142257	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142258	Well, I have no intention that they should remove legitimate statements. They probably already do so today; at least they remove a great deal of material according to their own guidelines, and some of it is certainly not prohibited by the penal code, but something that they do because they themselves think that some form of regulation is needed here. Now we are just saying that they must now also comply with the Danish penal code, and I do not really think that is an unfair requirement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142323	Anne Honoré Østergaard, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142324	Thanks for the speech. For the Left, it is very crucial that we find the right balance between the removal of illegal content and the restriction of freedom of expression, and I also hear that the SF has that concern. I also hear SF say that there are weaknesses in the draft law, and I hear SF say that they are tabling their own amendments to this particular bill. That is why I would just like to know whether SF could be interested in being involved in tabling an amendment from the blue side, in which we would like to make it more clear what the substance is, that is, what is illegal, so that we can only get rid of what actually is
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142415	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142416	Well, I actually think I could do that. I believe that the legislation must be complied with and that, of course, what is illegal under Danish law should not be freely promoted here either. Perhaps it is I who need to learn more about what that amendment actually looks like; but send it forward, and I will be happy to look at it without prejudice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142438	Mrs. Anne Honoré Østergaard, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142439	I'm just gonna sign for that, and I can promise there'll be one. And it will be very clear what is illegal... that's the part we'll be looking at. Now the rapporteur is perhaps a little alert here, and we certainly hope that the SF will take part in finding the right balance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142502	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142503	Well, we have the clear position that the penal code must be observed on social media too, so if it is within that framework, I think we'll figure it out, but send it to me. I'm really as concerned about this as the Left is about the fact that it's landing really well, so let's take a look at it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142521	Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142522	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is no doubt that Conservatives also share the rapporteur's intentions in terms of punishing and imposing if you cannot find out for yourself as a social media platform. We have seen too many bad examples of this. I don't think this bill can solve the problem. The rapporteur mentions the German model several times, but the German model is different. Then, in relation to the things that have already been mentioned about changes, will the rapporteur perhaps look at whether that is what should then be pursued in Denmark, then the German legislation rather than what is on the table?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142556	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142556-2	Well, I'm not rejecting the fact that we can look at improving this. What is just crucial to me, and I have now repeated this a few times, is that the Danish penal code is also respected on social media.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142610	Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142610-2	The rapporteur also mentions that German legislation has proved to be a success, but what is it really measured on? Is it measured by the fact that Facebook has employed some more and has spent a few more hours? It's not for me a success criterion. I think that's okay. It may then be, as I will also say in my rapporteur's speech, that they have spent a little more of their profits on it. But that is not what should be the success criterion. Where is the success of the German law?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142636	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142636-2	I think the rapporteur got it wrong. What I said was that, in relation to German legislation, there have been no significant challenges in terms of freedom of expression. And then I think it's pretty good that Facebook hires some moderators and some lawyers who, to some extent, can do yes, what can be said to moderate the content somewhat more. I personally do not think that there is any obvious illegal content, nor does it work with what is in the grey area; but there we must ensure that it is properly assessed so that we do not have to take account of what is happening in the grey area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142716	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments, and that means that we go further in the rapporteur's report to Mrs Katrine Robsøe, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329142726	Thank you for the floor. Let me start by making it clear that I am one of those who is in favour of the legislation in this area. For too long, social media have been unregulated and there are examples of illegal material allowed to stay on the platforms. Getting the material removed from the network as soon as possible is crucial to reducing the damage to the victims in these cases. Illegal content must be reduced, which is why I am also in favour of the intention behind the bill. However, I also have concerns about the specific legislative proposal, concerns, questions and uncertainties which I do not think I am alone in, and which I think we need to clarify through thorough committee work, so that we do actually get something done about the problem and not just fight blindfolded. The draft law here can be described as a form of process law to ensure that providers of social media platforms with more than 80 000 users in Denmark, for example. must have a button where illegal content can be notified and that the platform is obliged to comply with the notification within the first 24 hours. If you don't follow this process, you get a fine. But it is important in this discussion to remember that it is not the assessment whether or not the content is to be removed that gives a fine, but only whether or not an assessment takes place. I would therefore like the Minister to confirm that it is correctly understood that it is a lack of handling that can give a fine, not a possible wrong assessment. This is important to me in relation to the discussion on whether the draft law will cause too much content to be taken down. The draft law here suggests that there is a broader definition of what is illegal content than what is the case in Germany. The draft law envisages the removal of all criminal offences, i.e. following the definition used under the DSA, but at the same time applying the tighter time frame for taking down, which is in German law. And the results of that clutch, the effect of that clutch, I certainly need us to talk to each other properly. For some of the things I need to talk about in committee are, of course, concerns about the restriction of freedom of expression, the concern that too many phrases are being taken down, even if they should never be, concerns that need to be taken seriously, and with a world that is becoming increasingly digital, it is also our responsibility to have the conversation about the digital conversation and the democratic conversation on social media. That is why it is also important that we hit as properly as possible, and I certainly need to talk about the experience of Germany, which is really up and down in them, because I hear a little different interpretations. I also need clarification on the relationship with the DSA that is coming from the European Union, not because I feel sorry for huge social media platforms that were about to work a little faster with something at home, but because I want overall, unified legislation. I also hear the proposal for a sunset clause, which I think we also need to talk about, because it will force us, if we want to use that word, to reconsider how we can merge two laws. A new social media law will also have to be closely followed by an evaluation, and if it is possible in any way, I would also like continuous follow-up. I know that this is being met by the fact that the draft law has a transparency report to be drawn up here, but the question is whether we will be involved in it along the way. Social media are constantly evolving, which is why we also need to be more involved and not leave it to self-regulation. To be quite honest, I think this can only be a first step, which is why it is quite crucial to me that the first steps we are taking remain in the right direction, and right now, for me at least, there are some rather important questions which I think we will benefit from having clarified together. I do not in any way reject this bill in any way, even in an adapted form, but allow me to take the time in committee to get it through, in the hope that we can jointly find a regulation that works and where we hit what we actually want to hit. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143233	There are brief comments. First, it's from sir. Jens Rohde, KD.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143237	Thank you very much for that speech, Mrs. Katrine Robsøe. I thought it was a kindergarten speech you could be a little relieved of. Nobody is opposed to regulation, but now I know that the Radical Left is a strong EU-enthusiastic party, and it is no more than 4-5 days ago that a new directive has actually been adopted to deal with it here. Should we not ensure that the implementation of this directive escapes with our own legislation here, because otherwise, when we have to implement the directive within two years, we will then have to open it all once again so that we can breathe, even if we want to do good, and remember that the best can very often become the worst enemy of the good?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143330	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143330-2	That is also why, in my speech, I mentioned it here with the DSA and how the broad definition of what is illegal content has been taken and linked it to the time period to assess whether it is illegal or not, from Germany, and we simply have to, I think, in committee to have a thorough talk about how we can get to fit together. I am not opposed to the fact that we can do something faster on the Danish side. We also want radicals to ensure that the victims are protected in the best possible way and that they do not just wait unnecessarily for a long time. But it is clear that this has to be done properly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143418	Sir. Jens Rohde.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143419	Yes, indeed, because the end never justifies the means of a democracy, and if anyone should know it, it is radical, because it is radical DNA. Well, it used to be. So I hope that in the committee procedure I am not in the committee to look very carefully at that. Speaking of German legislation, Mrs Katrine Robsøe can of course take the view that, in relation to what Mrs Lorentzen Dehnhardt said, there are no problems with German legislation, I do not know what some German sides have been sitting and reading in the Freedom of Freedom Commission, but it does not require very many Google searches in Germany to find out that there are numerous problems with the legislation that has been made in Germany.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143501	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143501-2	Well, at least I'll take that with me. That was among other things. That is why, in my speech, I made it clear that I have at least been presented with several interpretations of the legislation in Germany, but that we must look at this in the committee work, and then we must see if we can find a way forward here, which I could also hope we could have a little broader support for and could do together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143525	Sir. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143526	I also think it is worth mentioning that it is already a criminal offence, for example. sexually offensive images up. It's like it's perfectly legal to do now. It's not. It's a felony and you're answerable to the courts for this. My appeal here is to go in and turn these tech companies into judges in areas where they have not been judges before to the same extent. And for that thing with a notification button for illegal content, I'd say no, it's a notification button, if you think in the normal justice system you'll get a charge, and then you might be convicted later. You're not gonna be convicted until you've been convicted. Here you go in and say that as soon as you press the button, Facebook must decide within 24 hours whether you have been convicted, without really having had the opportunity to do so, because they cannot do so physically. That means it's gonna be an AI robot who's gonna decide if you're guilty or not guilty. It is not worthy of a legal system. It is not worthy of a modern democratic society, I think, and these are the challenges and concerns that we face.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143631	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143632	This bill is precisely about making an assessment within the first 24 hours, and then you have to make it, and there has to be a reference to why you have chosen to do a or b. According to the bill, this is the case here, at least if I have understood it correctly, and that is also how I have heard it interpreted in technical review in the Ministry. If I am wrong, I have at least misunderstood it, but I do not think so, I would say so. The large platforms I think we must make demands to be able to keep an eye on the notifications that come from any illegal content, but when we come in and want us to try to see if we do it wisely, it is because we do not want too much content to be taken down either. What we want is also to make the platforms responsible for it if illegal content is shared on their platforms.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143741	Lars Boje Mathiesen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143742	I fully agree that they should be held responsible for illegal content, but it is precisely a court and a court that has to say to Facebook: this is illegal. I want you to take that down. I want you to keep an eye on that. But that's not what the bill does. Here you ask Facebook to keep an eye on everything that's just being reported. We must be careful to say that they must keep an eye on illegal content, because that is not the case. Here they are now told to keep an eye on everything and that is something other than that they have to keep an eye on illegal content.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143813	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143814	It is true that if this bill were adopted, they would also have to deal with the notifications that are coming, about what may be illegal content, and then they should then be able to assess whether it is. That means that the things that are quite clearly illegal and that we are also asking them to take down today are not, after all, a change that is included in this draft law. I just think that's important to remember. We are also telling them today that illegal content must be reduced. Now we're just making a law where we actually clarify it. They're taking it down today too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143850	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143851	Mrs Katrine Robsøe was very concerned at the start of her speech to get the Minister to confirm that this bill does not require social media to remove the content within 24 hours, but to assess the content within 24 hours. Unfortunately, that is not correct. Paragraph 16 of the bill. No. 1 6 reads: Unless higher penalties are due under other legislation, the service provider who fails to remove, block or maintain the content shall be fined no later than 24 hours from the time of notification. So what Mrs Katrine Robsøe believes to know about the bill is not correct. Now that Mrs Katrine Robsøe has been informed that this is not correct, does that mean that Mrs Katrine Robsøe and the Radical Left are against the bill, since it does not contain what Mrs Katrine Robsøe and the Radical Left thought it contained?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143948	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329143949	At least that is what I have been told and what I have asked the Minister to confirm from up here. And if it turns out to be wrong, we have to take it after that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144002	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144003	Yes, well, it takes a very short time to go into the bill and find the provision in question because such a fine schedule is included. There are two penalty forms, and the second penalty form refers to these paragraphs. And it says in Section 16, paragraph 1. No. 1 6: Unless higher penalties are due under other legislation, fines shall be imposed on the service provider who fails to remove, block or maintain the content within 24 hours from the time of notification. It is not just an assessment that needs to be made; there must be a removal. And that is what leads us to worry that too much is being removed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144036	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144037	Well, I would very much like to take this discussion further if we in the Radical Left misunderstood what is in the draft law. Now I actually asked the Minister to confirm it, so if Mr. Ole Birk Olesen is right in his reading, of course, will the Minister deny what I asked. And then we have to take it in committee and then. There was a reason why I actually asked the Minister to explain it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144101	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments, and we are moving forward, now to Mrs Mona Juul, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144120	Thank you for the floor. I am amazed every day by the posters, comments and divisions on social media. I'm offended, I'm surprised and shocked. I'm ecstatic, excited and smiled. I store content and rich dialogue, while I also sit and swamp for movies about food tricks. I receive rice and praise, suggestions, dick pics, threats. I divide up life's little ups and downs myself, stage, use filters and tell you how good I am. Social media can do something and have given everyone and everyone a mouthpiece. It's both beautiful and unbelievable, and frankly, I would like a little more human and a little less commercialization while at the same time considering using a facebook post for my next election campaign. I am not doing better than others, and I recognise the democratisation of the message that social media stand for. The management of media use, user interaction and the many opposing interests are often difficult to cope with. We live with indifferent mackerel baits and self-promoting, but there is one thing everyone agrees on, namely that of course we will not see violence, threats, child pornography and much else in the same way. It must and must be stopped. I'm afraid this bill doesn't. With the bill, the government will ensure that the media create a procedure for the removal of illegal content. That is fine, the intention is noble, and Conservatives absolutely support the idea that social media should assume responsibility for removing unacceptable content. But this legislation probably just means a little irritation, and probably during a thousand losses of profit for the biggest providers. If the intention is to hit the big platforms, it is wonderfully wasted forces, and at best only harassment of the media and their law-abiding users. This smells like a case that's on the government's two do-list before an election and that's supposed to make it look like you're having a fight with the social media. But this isn't going to happen, and it's not going to make any difference to illegal content. It smells like a huge waste of time, and let me elaborate on it: first of all, I would like to start by saying that the law will not make any difference to everything we want removed. This is simply because artificial intelligence already largely removes this kind of thing quickly. And of course it is illegal to share illegal content, it gives itself. We have legislation on that. Unfortunately, the big platforms, in particular, didn't do much about it at first, and it was to get angry about it. Maybe we're shocked by how much you can actually come up with. Too much floated around and wasn't shut down. But today, for example, ensures. YouTube, that terrible content has very difficulty getting through their filters and artificial intelligence. Fortunately, the vast majority of such videos are now removed before they even show up. Continuously, illegal and violent content is removed and, for inscrutable reasons, most videos are removed before the video has been shown more than ten times. It is actually quite wild, and a new procedure imposed cannot in any way improve it, only symbolically. On the other hand, entrepreneurs can watch and watch because there are also smaller platforms that have plans to limit their opportunities. The second important criticism from this is that this law is a Danish special law and that it is both overimplementation and dual legislation. For the EU's social media regulation law, the so-called digital services act, is expected to be adopted this spring, and that is in a few weeks' time. So when the DSA, as it is so called, is implemented, Danish companies will have to relate to both Danish special legislation as well as the DSA of the EU. And perhaps, as legislators, we need to put the legislation right again. In fact, it is precisely the Ministry of Industry's assessment that, in the future entry into force of the DSA, an adjustment of this law will also have to be made. Thirdly, there is the point that a 24-hour deadline for all illegal content puts a massive pressure on the freedom of expression of ordinary people and the democratic debate, quite literally. In search of illegal content, social media platforms with this law will be forced to take down a lot of content just to be safe. For the combination of short deadlines and extremely high fines, which consist of percentage turnover at group level, of course, puts considerable pressure on a platform to remove any content that can smell anything that is reported by users as illegal, even if it is often questionable. The equally powerful incentive to remove content will inevitably lead to over-regulation and harm freedom of expression. For example: against accusations of slander, racism or bad user reviews, which are one of the major grey areas and a large part of what many ordinary people are saying on the Internet. Something is obviously serious, something else is not, and one can say: why leave the legal assessment to the media? I would like to warn against the fact that we in Denmark are making such totalitarian legislation that, frankly, we only see in non-democratic countries. This law obliges the platforms to assess whether something illegal will occur in 24 hours! A task which can be extremely difficult and which, for example, with. racism takes the authorities up to 600 days. Conservatives are far from the only ones who see these problems. I can mention a large number of organisations, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also warns about German legislation. And this one is much more far-reaching. It's shot way above target, and, yeah, it's crazy. Let us now sit with good people and find out how we can get rid of illegal and intolerable content from an international perspective. I will end my speech because I cannot make it all, but I just want to say that if we do not have any changes in this legislation, then Conservatives will not vote in favour.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144708	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Malte Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144712	Thank you. It was a lot of things about what misfortunes this law will bring. Can I interpret it as saying that the Conservative People's Party does not want to do anything here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144728	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144728-2	That is a completely wrong interpretation of Mr. Malte Larsen. As I started by saying, there are actually really big challenges on social media still missing, and there we would like to share in discussing what we can do. I also believe that the rapporteur heard my question to the SF, where I also said precisely that it is important for us to look at the shortcomings that exist. I don't think it's okay to ask exactly that way, because what we're talking about right now is symbolic policy on the part of your government, and it's not about whether we want to do anything about social media or not.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144800	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144802	Could I have the rapporteur then become a little bit more specific in relation to an answer given to the citizen who today is waiting unfairly long for illegal, offensive content to be taken down, because one has to wait a very long time before, for example, a judgment is passed on this matter? What is the conservative response to the citizens?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144824	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144825	It is, of course, the case that the European Union is already providing an answer. If we can just wait a few weeks, there will actually be something we have to deal with and see if is good enough for us or not. So that's the conservative answer right now. If that's not good enough, sir. Malte Larsen, we'll look at it again. But this is an overimplementation, it is dual legislation, it is the compilation of a whole lot of laws that are already there, and it is just a procedure.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144849	Thank you. Then it is Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144855	Thank you for that very fine speech. I just want to hear something from the rapporteur. As I understand it, the rapporteur is also concerned that there must of course be a very good balance between taking down clearly illegal content and freedom of expression. Can the rapporteur say a little more about this and confirm it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144920	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144921	Thank you for the question. There is no doubt about that. Well, we do have legislation in this area; there should be no doubt about that. You make this bill sound like it's not there, but it's there. This bill then just puts it upstairs, and it's inappropriate, and it's not fenced in, and that means that we leave the legal work to the social media platforms. It's quite horrible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144947	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329144948	In other words, I understand that the Conservatives also want to play their part in trying to see whether you can enclose what is clearly illegal and then have to be taken down, and then set it against the tech giants rather than this bill, where it is in all legislation, etc.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329145012	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329145012-2	We are absolutely constructive about this. I also believe that the Folketing should do itself the service of listening to some experts in this area. What's possible? How can we do this? How can we put it in a better place? Because you cannot say everything and then ask for a huge amount of fines, because then there will be a marked loss of freedom of expression, and we simply cannot support that. But I will work constructively in committee as always.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329145040	Thank you to Mrs Mona Juul. There are no more brief comments. And I would like to welcome Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329145055	Thank you. Most of us remember when two young women from Denmark and Norway were brutally murdered in Morocco, and how the murders were recorded on films and the pictures from there flourished on social media long after; they were not tampered with. Similarly, I have also been approached by people who have experienced pictures of their children being taken in the dressing room, or that there has been talk of revenge porn and other vile things. I myself experienced a few years ago that there was a closed facebook group that threatened to leak some personal passwords that I had to different places, and as soon as that threat came, I hurried to report it to Facebook. It wasn't tampered with, the codes were leaked anyway, and it wasn't tampered with either. That is why I have enormous sympathy for the suggestion here that this kind of thing should be removed within 24 hours. What is then just the problem is what the previous rapporteurs have been talking about: the huge, huge grey area that is, and it is a grey area that we meet every day. I sat scrolling down on a facebook page today and saw some manipulated image of Putin lying in an open coffin and dead, and Zelensky, sitting next to the coffin, took a selfie with a thumbs up and looked happy. It's such a gray-zone image. Parents who post a picture of their 11⁄2-year-old child who pop naked in the paddling pool are reported for children's children. An artist who paints a naked woman is reported for it. Talks that people find offensive in these times when it's so modern to feel offended. Wow, man! If you put up a picture, and someone says to the woman: "How nice you look in that dress, they get busy, those tech giants get busy with this, if they have to deal with all the reviews, every time someone feels offended. So if we adopt the proposal, how do we protect those people who improperly have their things removed? Will this lead to even more notifications of content that are not illegal? It is very important that, in the further examination of this bill, we are absolutely sharp on the grey area. First of all, we need to evaluate or even have a sunset clause in this proposal, but before we go any further, we need to be quite sharp on this grey area so that it is not the wrong ones to fall into the trap. So we look forward to the continuation of the committee procedure. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329145421	Thank you to Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker. There are no brief comments, so we now have the opportunity to hear Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen from New Citizens' rapporteur speech. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329145432	Thank you. This bill is an attack on freedom of expression, and it will be a bill that will clearly divide the Folketing between parties that uphold and fight for freedom of expression, and then parties that will use their majority to limit freedom of expression and use it as a tool to strengthen their power and position. The parties behind this bill are talking about Facebook being kept under control, but this bill has absolutely nothing to do with keeping Facebook under control. On the contrary, Facebook is now being elevated to become a kind of court that has previously belonged to some quite different institutions in society. Now it is up to Facebook to decide whether a speech is illegal or not illegal, and even in this Parliament it is required that Facebook should make the assessment of whether a speech is illegal or not illegal in 24 hours. But the same Parliament has no problem with the fact that the court, which is, you might say, for our society, is up to 600 days to decide these things. How can you pass such responsibility on to a private company with the power you know to follow? If Facebook does not remove content that may potentially be illegal within 24 hours, then they will be fined. Everyone can tell themselves that then, of course, you remove everything where you are in doubt. Nobody can think about that. In order to avoid massive fines, we also remove that and that. This bill has no element of rights if legal content is removed for whoever gets it removed. He has no right to compensation and no opportunity to get it back quickly. This is in every way a crooked piece of legislation. Then we hear from the House here today: yes, but it is about protecting people who put up pictures that are sexually offensive and so on. I couldn't agree more. Let's protect them. Let us then make legislation which, if we do not think that what is going on now is good enough, is even more specific about these elements, which we can all agree on must be removed and removed quickly. However, if it is a matter of utterances that you may not like, because you have a different political attitude or over which you are just personally offended, then you now have the right to take your personal sense of violation out on everyone else by pressing the review button: I accuse, I report. And Facebook's gonna be acting judge within 24 hours. We're gonna have to take a good look at this bill. When we look at the courts today, they have a very central position in Danish society. In disputes and disputes, they must judge whether something is illegal or legal. We salute the fact that the courts must be independent, that they must be politically blind, but now the government wants to turn Facebook into a judge. If there is anything Facebook has shown so far, it is that Facebook is not politically independent, that Facebook is not politically blind. When you can experience being taken down from Facebook, which in fact only describes a reality, for example. that non-western immigrants are more criminal than ethnic Danes; when you can get it taken down, because Facebook makes a political assessment and decides that they don't like it on their media, then they act judges. So I'm much more concerned that this is an attack on freedom of expression, which doesn't protect people, so they can continue to express what is otherwise within the framework of general Danish law, where you are accountable for your statements to the courts. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329145953	You're welcome. There are no brief comments, so we will move on to the next rapporteur, and that is Mr Beazley. Ole Birk Olesen of the Liberal Alliance. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329150001	This social media thing isn't quite easy. The social media place themselves in a grey area between a part of society where we did not think, nor today, that there should be supervision, removal of content and restrictions, and another part of society where we believe that there is a publisher's responsibility for what is being printed. So, what we go around saying to each other on the street, at home in the living room, etc., and where we can say that that Peter is a fucking pedophile, no one regulates. We can do that, because you do that now, if it is that you have the impression of someone. On the other hand, if you have a media or newspaper and you receive a statement that Peter is a paedophile, and if you choose to print it, the paper is jointly responsible for making a potential liberating claim. Then we have the social media where there doesn't sit an editor and approve every statement it's like in our living rooms or out on the streets and alleys or in a park where we sit and bask, where there is no editor to control what we say either. Then these social media are asked to carry out the same kind of control and the same type of delete function etc. that the established media have in relation to the content they approve for publication. It is as if it is believed that social media is not an extension of street life and privacy, but more is an extension of the established media with all their editors who approve things before they are printed. It creates some challenges, because just as it is not possible to control what is said in any room or in any park or in any workplace, it is also not possible to control all the millions and billions of statements that appear on social media every day. That's not possible. So the social media do in an attempt to be platforms for a more positive dialogue than they could otherwise be, some features where they offer that other users can report it if some have gone too far and then they make an assessment of it. So it is my certain impression that they have been rising up more and more, so that they actually also get rid of things that could potentially be illegal. This does not mean that they never make mistakes, and in particular some of the mistakes that have been made here in the platform today have been made. However, it is my impression that most of them are years ago; that it is years ago that social media have left things behind that they should not have left behind after the reviews. But then this bill will say that they must be as responsible for things as Berlingske and the TV newspaper, and if they do not remove things within 24 hours or at least make an assessment it may be the correct one, as Mrs Katrine Robsøe said, they may get a fine. After all, it puts pressure on social media to do something that is really difficult, namely to make assessments of millions of statements every day. I also believe that it will put pressure on those who will lead to them deleting more than they should do, at least seen with our glasses, and I believe with most people's glasses. That is why we are very critical of this bill and do not expect to be able to vote in favour of what it is here. The main argument for us, then, is that those who support the bill confuse social media with traditional media, instead of saying that it is the continuation of ordinary social life, of what is going on in the home, in the parks, in the jobs, in associations, etc., where there is no caretaker who keeps an eye on it all the time. Social media are making a lot of effort, and I actually think they are doing it very well. I also disagree with those who say that social media should not remove more than the law requires. They're gonna have to get rid of everything they want. They can have a desire to make a cozy gathering where you don't yell at each other and where you don't share porn and things like that. They'd love to. Even if it is not illegal to yell at each other, even if it is not illegal to share porn, they may want their social media not to be so. It's a private media, and they have to do whatever they want in this field. But do not confuse them with traditional media. They are more of an extension of ordinary social life. And this bill treats them like they're traditional media.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329150455	Thank you very much, sir. Ole Birk Olesen. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Jens Rohde of the Christian Democrats.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329150506	Yeah, where do you almost start and end this? I think we are all interested in dealing with some of the challenges that are obviously in the social media universe. But you have to be very, very careful about what instruments you use, because with freedom of expression it is extremely difficult matters: what is legal and what is not legal to pass on. I remember when I was young, beautiful and chivalrous and I was on Radio Viborg. Now I'm only young. We had a man who called open radio and said some pretty obvious racist things. A charge came out of this, and our news paper then began to process the story that there had been a charge, and then to illustrate what the charge was about, was cut with the man who had spoken in what was called open radio, brought forward on that broadcast. It then turned into a charge against Radio Viborg's leadership to further collate such statements so that there was a racism charge and charges against us. It then fell at the court in the end. I think most people, at least at my age, remember Jens Olaf Jersild's case, where he was convicted of racism at home, but acquitted at the Court of Human Rights of his right to make a feature that was socially relevant. I am just saying this to tell you that we are dealing with problems which are extremely difficult, and you are asking some of the companies themselves to do so, which you are giving almost unlimited power rather than placing it under the authority or administration to deal with within 24 hours. I think we need to be extremely careful about that, because if they get huge fines for not removing it immediately, they will automatically begin to remove everything that lies in the grey areas. I don't care if I think that mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen's views are sometimes abominable, so I still think he has the right to pronounce them, and then it has to go into the open what he thinks, and then I can go against those views in a debate, but I do not have the opportunity to do so if things are just removed. Then both sides will actually cut their legs, and I do not think that is appropriate. Finally, allow me to take up the question of whether the end justifies the means to another level of abstraction. Remember Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus? There was quite an interesting discussion between them. They were both socialists and existentialists and philosophers of life. When, all of a sudden, large flows of refugees from the Soviet Union spread into Austria-Hungary and France, which wanted to leave Stalin's regime, the Communist heart of Jean-Paul Sartre was not to pass on these reports of what was going on in the Soviet Union, because we should not disappoint Billancourt, as he said, so we should not disappoint the Communist workers and trade unions in the French auto factories. The end sanctified the means. For Albert Camus it was quite different, although they shared political views in many respects. The goal can never sanctify the means. Of course, you have to continue to collate the stories that are relevant to society and, of course, you have to have an open and free discussion about everything that is relevant to society, even if some may be disappointed or offended. That is the word we use today in the debate we have. I use this as a picture just to emphasise that, regardless of whether we want to do good here, and I also recognise the Government's intentions about this, we must be careful not to let the end sanctify the means, because it can in itself end up as a self-censoring institution and a fundamental problem for our freedom of expression and, therefore, a fundamental problem for our democracy and for our rule of law here in society. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329151013	You're welcome, sir. Jens Rohde. There are no comments. And Mr. Jens Rohde provides the service that he prepares for the Minister for Business, who now has the floor. Thank you for that and welcome to the Minister for Business.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329151035	Thank you very much for that, and thank you for a lively debate, I think we can see about this bill. I think that if there's something we can agree on, and it's across parties in here, it's enough that tech giants and social media are something that takes up a large part of our lives. A large part of what we do in here, even in the Parliament Hall, quickly comes out on Facebook, and it comes on Twitter and other social media. It may be that someone has even been on the phone and on social media during the course of the debate. It's a world of opportunities, and it just gets bigger day after day. We can talk to the whole world when it suits us, and it's really pretty amazing. But it also means that a handful of social media help control and shape a large part of our everyday life, and with that there are a number of challenges. Because when the algorithm also becomes the rhythm of our society, there is something wrong, and then we have to stop and insist that it is us as communities, as politicians and as democracy that are taking the lead, and that is why we need to sharpen our focus on how to solve these challenges that are in the field with the tech giants. That was the purpose when the Prime Minister launched the first government White Paper on tech giants this summer under the title "Towards a better society with tech giants'. The White Paper set the direction, but it also gave a serious boost to the debate on the role of tech giants in our society. That is why I am also pleased with the legislative proposal before us today. It is an offshoot of our action from August last year, when we presented a project on social media responsibility. Overall, we will hold social media responsible for the content of their platforms. The legislative proposal before us today will then create better opportunities to regulate the area, and that will be one of the things that will happen. means that illegal content could be child pornography must be removed or blocked within 24 hours and time makes a difference. If the medium fails to comply with the legal requirement, you will be punished with a fine of up to 6%. the turnover of the company's group and that is a large fine. This fine will be adjusted according to the number of Danish users, but the fine must and must be so large that it can be felt. The draft law also creates transparency, and it also gives users better opportunities to notify illegal content. In this way, with the bill here, we are making better protection for better protection against illegal content on the web. And even if the proposal here, and I recognise it too, does not solve all the challenges, it is an important step in the right direction. The reality is that we can and must act nationally, but, of course, at the same time we must also recognise that tech giants are international by their very nature, and therefore some solutions must also be found internationally, for example. through pan-European action in the European Union, and that is why we also support the government and, indeed, with very broad support for the mandate given in the European Committee, the approach to the EU's tech proposals, which have been referred to here both as the DMA and the DSA, and which, overall, are also major steps on the road to better regulation of the tech giants. We have bigger muscles when it's together in the European Union, we take the fight, but I do not think that we should wait for the DSA to be implemented. That is why we want to introduce our own national rules until the DSA comes into force. One thing, of course, is when to come to an agreement, another is when to become concrete, and another is when to come into force. I think we should do this in Denmark to ensure that social media assume greater responsibility for the removal of illegal content as soon as possible. That is what we want to do with this bill here, also because a country like Germany has gone ahead and implemented similar legislation. I would like to address some of the more specific elements of the draft law. The proposal contains a number of obligations for social media providers with over 80,000 user profiles in Denmark. As a starting point, social media, within 24 hours of receiving a notification, have to decide whether to remove, block or maintain content, and on that basis I can also confirm, in relation to what the radical rapporteur asked, how the law should be understood here: what we are regulating and what can be fined is whether you have taken a position or not, not what the actual assessment is, but whether you have taken a position, because we have seen cases where 24 hours are very short, but where there is no action in days, weeks and months. Alternatively, as a social media platform, you can also have 7 days if it is content that requires further investigation. So there are the 24 hours, but there are also the 7 whole days. And the reviewer or the person who has his or her content blocked or removed has the right to have the decision reviewed by the social media. This means that the decision of the provider must be reviewed if one party disagrees with the decision. Then, once a year, the social media will have to submit a report containing information on compliance with the obligations contained in this bill. With the proposal, therefore, we will have the opportunity to gain a greater insight into the content moderation of social media, I should like to say, as the platforms already do today. It will sound as if content moderation is something completely new when you listen to the debate from certain parties. It is already happening today, just according to its own internal guidelines. In addition to creating this transparency, the reports we are going to require must at the same time be used as part of the basis for the Competition and Consumer Authority to supervise and carry out analyses in this area. Adequate powers must be guaranteed to ensure effective enforcement of the law. Infringements of the provisions of the Act may have material damage to those exposed to illegal content and therefore the bill provides for penalties to be imposed on service providers who infringe the obligations. To conclude, I would like to say that there is no soul in the Folketing that does not care about our freedom of expression, but we also, as politicians, as democratically elected leaders, have a duty to look after the people, the young people and the people in general who are exposed to illegal content on social media, and where today a very long time may pass before action is taken or reacted to it. There is a need for better protection for all of us on social media. With this bill, we are trying to set deadlines so that assessments are carried out more quickly and that the protection of citizens comes into force more quickly and more effectively. That's what we're doing here. We don't make new courts in Facebook. They are completing content moderation today. We tell them that they must have taken a position quickly so that matters do not jam. So this is about providing better protection for the citizens of our society, and we all want to take care of freedom of expression, and I very much believe that this proposal does and protects. But we must have the debate. Now we have had the first one today, and I am very pleased with the contribution made by the radical rapporteur that we should have a more political debate, including in committee, where it often becomes either a technical review or a consultation or something. We need to find another form. It may be that we have to go over to the Department of Business and talk about it, at least those who are interested in finding a way for you to be in this bill. Now I have tried to throw a little more nuance over some of the things, and then I look forward to having a good debate and starting it in this Chamber. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152021	You're welcome. There are a number of brief remarks. It's sir. Thomas Danielsen from the Left, starting.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152035	Thank you. I just wanted to take the floor, because the Socialist rapporteur said that the rapporteur did not consider that more legal content would be removed as a consequence of the government's legislative proposals. Does the government share that assessment?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152044	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152051	The point of this bill is that when there is illegal content, it has to go away, and it has to go faster than it is today. It is unsatisfactory and it is a bad experience when illegal content is not removed. That is why we will be calling for a decision to be taken within a short period of time as to whether a notice is illegal or not. If you're in doubt, if it's an ordinary and proper poster that should be allowed to be there, and it takes more detailed research, then you'll have more time. Then it's seven days. And you also have the opportunity, in case it was Thomas Danielsen's notice that was reported, to complain about it, and then, of course, it has to be re-evaluated. So, on this basis, I share the view of the Socialist rapporteur that this should not lead to the removal of legal and proper listings, but rather to the fact that illegal listings, which are being removed too slowly today or which may not be removed at all, are actually being deleted.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152148	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152151	Thank you. However, I assume that there are some assessments which the Minister has received, and so I would just like the Minister to be able to reply to what the Minister has been informed by his official work. In this case, does the government, and hence the Minister, share the view of the Socialist rapporteur that no more legal content on social media will be removed as a consequence of the bill?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152219	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152223	I do not see why the bill should lead to the removal of more legal content. The bill should lead to more removal of illegal content. Then some have said that when there are such large fines, one must also assume that they then take it all away, more or less, that is to say, things that are legal. But remember that the fines are about the evaluation process of the post and not necessarily the outcome of that process. This can then be criticised if you want to, and you may think it is too weak, but that does not mean that they do not fall into the ditch that some rapporteurs have mentioned, namely that a lot of legal content goes too. So yes, immediately it is also my opinion that this should not lead to the removal of more legal content.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152307	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152309	Has the Minister ever been made aware by any stakeholders, by companies or by his official work that this could potentially result in more legitimate statements being removed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152321	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152323	Well, we've had the debate. After all, there has been a debate and the consultation parties have pointed out what has happened in Germany and how the law which reminds us not completely, but very much about what we are implementing here has worked. And it has to be said that at least, as I have been informed, the German evaluation has shown that no more legal content has been removed. I think that some ghosts will be created in the debate, with the way in which various rapporteurs, among other things. The questioner himself, has spoken in the rapporteur's speech and has spoken in the debate here, because I think there are facts that speak in the other direction and because nuances in the legislative proposal say that this is not where we end up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152409	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152411	We should probably get a written answer to this, because it became an outside talk from up there; so we must get a written answer to that. The problem with this is to leave the right of expression and the demand for freedom of expression and freedom of expression to a private company. If you wanted to take this seriously and want to protect freedom of expression, you would have set up a court, a body that could decide quickly, and I would have liked to take part in the fact that when the independent courts or authorities had made this decision, Facebook had a short time to remove it. But it must be an authority that has to decide whether Danish legislation is being broken or not being broken, and then we can easily say afterwards that Facebook has a short time to do so afterwards. It is then a failure on the part of the authorities that it takes a year or sometimes almost two years for these cases to be dealt with, but that is the responsibility we have to take on us in here, and then we have to set up a body in which this can be decided and decided within 24 hours if there is a notification, or 48 hours if there is a notification, and then Facebook then has a short time to act on the authority decision taken. But here you leave responsibility to a private company.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152517	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152519	I believe that New Citizens must consider whether the water is hot or cold. Because if the rapporteur means what he says in his speech here, then the logical consequence must be that when Facebook has to deal with reports of illegal content today, Facebook has already been turned into a court today, and then it has to be rolled back if I am to follow the logic of the rapporteur, thereby weakening consumer protection in the social media. Facebook is today dealing with illegal content. What this bill does is to tighten up on the fact that it has to go quickly, that there are some processes where we need to protect citizens and users on social media better than we do today. So on the question of whether Facebook should relate to illegal content or not, it's already like this today; it just needs to be better.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152608	Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152615	Thank you, Minister. Sometimes when you have to face green, when you are standing at the pedestrian crossing, you can get a little late, and then you stand there in the middle of pedestrian fields and see that suddenly it has turned red. So am I in a mess there, or am I not in a mess? What if it was the minister who was standing there thinking, 'Oh, is it legal or illegal, what I'm doing here?' But if the Minister knew that it would cost 6%. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply. Because that's where we are. This punishment is so wild. Well, 6%. I am sure that the Commission will be able to take the necessary steps to ensure that we do not lose sight of the fact that we are not in a position to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152700	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152704	I understand the picturesque question, but it is based on a premise that you get this huge fine, and such a fine must therefore be large, it must be felt. You get it if you don't remove content that is being reported. But that is not the case. The case is that when some content is notified, we say: then you have to deal with it, dear social media platforms, within a certain time limit, because we want you to take a position on it. If it is illegal, it must of course be taken away, and it must be done quickly. We can all remember the story of the mother who kept getting illegal videos from the daughter who was killed in a bestially manner, and it was bypassed one way or another, and it took a long time, and it was reported, and it was not removed. That's the kind of thing we're not going into. And that's why you can't compare it, however picturesque it is, and I like Mona Juul's imagery, but you can't compare it with what this bill does, because this bill requires the process to be carried out quickly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152806	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152809	Thank you. There is no doubt that in that case it was very inappropriate. I haven't heard anything about so many other cases. So the question is whether we are again making some legislation because of a matter which, I hope, has been resolved. Why won't the minister wait for the DSA? As I understand it, it will come within weeks, which means that if this legislation is adopted, as it is on the table today, there may be a difference, and then we will have to adjust it again after six months. And having said that: yes, thank you for sitting around the table in the ministry and seeing if we can make a common solution, instead of showing the upper arm, which I think is a bit of a rubber arm.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152843	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152847	Thank you for the interest in also wanting to attend the meeting that Conservatives are invited to, of course, because it makes good sense that we are trying to find out what concerns you can have. I fully respect it, I'm just trying to nuance it and explain what the bill is about. And then I think it is important to say that, as a minister, because I am bringing up a single matter to illustrate it, I do not think it is fair that one would then suggest that it is probably a single matter that we are responding to here. The existence of illegal content flourishing on social media is a widespread phenomenon. It is offensive and it is wrong that it should be found on social media. It needs to be removed and that process can be speeded up, and that's what we can do with this bill. That is why I propose that we vote it through.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152941	Then it's mr. Jens Rohde.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329152947	Well, I assume that we agree that it is already the case today that illegal content should be removed from the web. And now the German experience is constantly being referred to. If you now had some people who might have read German, you would find that as late as 8 March, the Verwaltungsgericht Köln herbilt im Eilverfahren gegen Deutschland • Unwirksamkeit durch Fehler in Normen • in relation to that legislation. What does that mean? This means that the Cologne Administrative Court in Germany says that the law is not effective and cannot be effective because it is based on wrong premises, among other things. in accordance with European legislation. So to come and say that there are no problems with German legislation is simply not right. After all, we have a court in Germany that says it is there. And the court's rejection of the German law is based on four grounds. What is the Minister's answer to that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153051	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153055	I think I said very clearly because it was part of the debate that an evaluation of German legislation has been carried out and that the experience that can be drawn from that evaluation puts in a different light the allegations that have been made in this Chamber that there will be massive removal of legal content. Because that is not what the evaluation in Germany showed, and that is not the experience that can be taken further. So that's the evaluation we're dealing with. In our view, this legislation can, of course, be implemented. And, of course, if there is experience from German courts that is not part of that assessment, we must ensure that they do so too. But I have no reason to believe or believe that this legislation should not be transposed into Danish law.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153152	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153156	No, of course it can. But to point out to Germany that it is unproblematic and that experience is such and such, where, moreover, the law has had full effect only per year. 1 February 2022 in relation to everything that needs to be removed, I think maybe it's just as cocky as that. It's just to say, don't use the German example as a platform to say it's just straight off the road here at home. So I repeat: you cannot do that. And I'd like to give the Minister a few links if he's in doubt. So I would urge you to keep the ball in your own court and then let us discuss how to get the best possible legislation out of this with the fewest possible grey areas. I hope that the Minister here today will give his undertaking that he would, of course, be involved in negotiating and seeing whether we can qualify the law so that we have the least possible grey areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153255	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153258	I can give an assurance of that, and I think that is a good way of working. Now not all the rapporteurs are here anymore, but I hope that we will all do the same here, namely raise the level of protection for the citizens and users who are on social media around the globe, but in the first place in Denmark. Now we're not going to go deeper into this, but I think that law in Germany after my memory has worked for some years. As I remember, it is back from 2018 and 2019, but we can get that information. If sir... Jens Rohde sends links, I can send information the other way about the law's duration of effect.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153338	Mrs. Anne Honoré Østergaard, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153345	Thank you, Minister. As the Minister can surely hear and perceive, there are several places where there is concern about freedom of expression in relation to the government's bill. What I hear the Minister say is that the Minister will not accept that paragraph because the Minister cannot see that there is a risk that more legal content will be removed with the government's bill. Therefore my questions are: Question 1: When it is just in the goose-eyes that it is a position on the platform they must reach within the 24 hours, then the Minister can put words on what is enough to put this position on the 24 hours. That is one question. Question 2: If you have had some of a lookup removed, for example. Has he written that the minister is a cod, then what? What, then, is the process when it comes to getting it back up again, that is to say, the complaint process? Can the Minister imagine the two different things and are they the same in the bill?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153446	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153449	Now, unfortunately, I do not think it is illegal to say that the ministers are a cod, and it should not be. Of course, there must be room for a bold debate on social media as well. But there must also be room, when something is illegal, for you to report it and for you to get a quick response from social media. I think there are a lot of people who have the experience of such a big black box, there are the social media there isn't a door to walk in; there isn't a phone to call; how do you get someone? And when you press the report, it's like hitting a duvet. Nothing happens. I think you can sit with that experience. And that is why it is important that we set up time limits that are effective here. And in relation to when there is enough time for the action to be taken, I would say: well, you have to react within 24 hours, and then you have to give a reason for it. That is what is required for the 24 hours. And then, of course, everyone has the right to be able to verify it, as I also say. So, if it were my post or Mrs. Anne Honoré Østergaard's post, we would be able to verify it if we disagreed with the conclusion. And then I think that the annual reports we are now beginning to receive when the law is passed give us a basis to speak in relation to adjustments and improvements to the law, also in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153603	A cod is a fish. Among other things, it can: bought at the harbour in Hanstholm. Mrs. Anne Honoré Østergaard, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153612	Well, I just mentioned it because the government likes to talk about quotas. That's why I thought we might as well bring something like that in. However, I do not think that the Minister quite mentioned the difference in the process when you take something down and put something up. So, is it the same requirement that applies when you take something down the platforms, as when you put something up the complaint part? Because if it is not the same, i.e. if there are more demands for the first than to the last, then I can be concerned on behalf of freedom of expression. And can the Minister not also see that there may be similar demands there?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153646	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153649	Well, I guess I'd have almost said that for the sake of safety and completeness, we'd love to help you schematically. Now we have to be careful not to get into any mistakes, because what the rapporteur is asking is: if there are 24 hours to go, not to take anything down, but to make an assessment of the notification you have received, what is the precise time limit for when you can get it back if it actually turns out that it should not have been taken down? That's how I hear it. And I would like to come back with that in writing so that we can have it accurately drilled out. And I'm also thinking that the Left is going to the meeting we're holding in the Ministry to move on into the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153725	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. And since that is not the case, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. And it seems that there will also be ministerial meetings and coffee over there. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153812	As you know, there is no minister in this area. It is Parliament's own responsibility, and I will listen carefully to the debate on the proposal, which is of course to be discussed in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. The debate has been opened, and the first to speak is Mr Beazley. Lennart Damsbo-Andersen from the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329153830	Thank you, President. In the social democracy we are concerned with getting as many people as possible involved in and contributing to the democratic process. We share the concerns of the proposers, in that over time fewer people have been active in the political parties and that the democratic dialogue is increasingly marked by a narrow elite, both in reality and very much on the previous point on social media. That is why we are also pleased to have the debate raised here in the Things today, because we politicians have a responsibility, if any, for the democracy that we are living in here, both in terms of content and in terms of relevance, to reflect the reality that is outside the bubble at Christiansborg. As the Danish Parliament has been opened up more and more over recent years in relation to accessibility to meetings and debates via the Internet, for example, in relation to making citizens' proposals and with the Youth Parliament and Politician for a day special for young people, everything else is even more likely to participate as a citizen in the things that are going on and be inspired to actively enter the debates. But at the same time studies show that there is an increasing social and educational imbalance both in the way in which the Folketing is composed and in relation to who is involved in and defines the debate. In relation to the specific resolution, we have not changed our position since the last time we discussed it here. We are positive, but we see challenges in the fact that the proposal is not concrete and contains nothing about the economy and where the money should come from. That is why I am also looking forward to the committee reading, and I will propose to the proposers to go to the workshop, if you will allow me to say so, with the proposal and with the wishes that may be expressed in this connection, for the financial legislation negotiations in the autumn. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154050	You're welcome. There are a few brief comments. The first one's from sir. Uffe Elbæk, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154058	First of all, I am, of course, very, very pleased that the Social Democrats welcome the proposal. Second, I would also be very surprised, because in the chronicle that came in Jyllands-Posten back in May 2018 there I was party leader of the Alternative to which the current Prime Minister was involved, and it was all those who helped make this proposal, we made a number of proposals, and the third proposal was actually a proposal for a centre for democracy development and citizen involvement. So I would also have been very surprised if the Social Democrats had changed their attitude. Then the rapporteur says that he hopes that we can develop it further, that it will be in the workshop and become more concrete. But that is what must happen when it comes to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. Is that also the rapporteur's experience?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154151	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154154	It is true that there was an article back then. It is written on the right basis. I also say here in my rapporteur's speech that there is a great deal to be worried about. That's where we agree. But where the problem arises, it does at least for us in this situation, is when you have to be quite specific and have to look at: What size are we looking into? How many people are we talking about? What's the cost of this? What are you imagining? There are, of course, a number of elements which are described in the motion for a resolution, but what is one imagined that each element, for example, is the same? You're gonna fill up? Without that, it is very difficult to go in and say: yes, we are just doing this. I don't want to be totally dismissive. I can give a completely negative answer, but I would rather have a positive approach and ask: can you look at it again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154244	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154247	What was the matter when we last debated it was that there was the same kind of positive approach and then it was passed on to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. There was then just a choice in 2019, which is why it has been non-existent since. When we re-create it now, it is of course because we want a development centre for the Folketing, and because it is a development centre for the Folketing, it is also the parliament's economy. That's why we have to figure out together how we imagine this development centre is going to look, how many employees there are going to be, what kind of tasks there are going to be, and then it's up to the Folketing to find that money.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154329	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154333	Well, I don't disagree with that at all. In fact, I am just trying to help the rapporteur for the proposers by saying: can't you go home and look at it again? Because it is clear that it will be in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and that there will be a debate in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. However, I just think it would be really, really a pity if it were to end with the proposal coming back to the vote in this Chamber and that it would end with the absence of a majority in favour of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154355	Then it is Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154400	Thank you for your invitation. I can hear those pre-ordered mandates, I know them well, I also sometimes put them out to rapporteurs in my own party, where I cannot really say yes to something that you actually agree with. And it's quite fair that that's the way it is. I take the call positively, because I think we should go further in the UFO and therefore say that it is not in the financial law negotiations that this should happen; it is here in the Folketing; that is why there is no minister present, and that is because it is our responsibility. And then I hope that the rapporteur will also use the time to go back to his party and say that we have actually helped to propose this ourselves, because this is precisely what I think we agree on: the development of democracy, inclusion, representativeness. So if we go back and bring it here into the UFO with the words that the rapporteur well knows there is no room for in a motion for a resolution, how many people we imagine, and take it up at a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on the Rules of Procedure, as the UFO is, it may be, everyone else does not know exactly what it is • can we count on the rapporteur and his party to take a positive part in that dialogue in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154514	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154518	I can confirm that. I even think that there is a great deal of work, especially in the last stick, about how to get, you can say those who are really on the verge of finding out how to participate in democracy. 'Cause I think that's actually what's the hardest part. The easy thing is to get someone who has read more than two books in their lives to participate. The difficult, really difficult task lies in getting hold of all of them and getting involved with all those who are harder with it and who do not interfere in the debate, but vote because it has to be done, and then, by the way, believe that politicians are doing the right thing. To get them to take an active part in discussions and debates I think it will be really, really difficult, and for my part I think it is very important to have that part in the work of the committee.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154612	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154616	Then it is fortunate that it is part of the proposal. That is precisely what the intention is. It may be that some prejudices on the part of the rapporteur stated that this was not the intention, but it is. Democracy is for everyone, it said Hørup, and we are born on it in the Radial Left. Then we must work forever to ensure that it really is for everyone, and that would be one of the ways of experimenting with it. However, I accept the call and really hope that we can put a little turbo on it so that it is not something that takes three more years, but something that we bring into the Committee on the Rules of Procedure so that we can just start making democracy accessible to many more people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154652	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154655	Well, I'm thinking it's not necessary to comment on it further. It will be an exciting work in committee.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154659	Then we move on to Mr. Jan Bjergskov Larsen from SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154703	Thank you. I could hear from the rapporteur that he thinks it would be a pity if the proposal fell if there were no majority behind it, and then I just want to hear whether the rapporteur agrees with the proposers that if the Social Democrats support it, there is actually a majority.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154718	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154720	Well, I haven't heard everyone say that, but I guess that's what I'm thinking.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154726	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154730	I have another question. What is the rapporteur's view or description of a democracy? Could the rapporteur explain this with just a few sentences?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154742	In 30 seconds.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154746	I just have 30 seconds. It was an exciting question to get here on Tuesday afternoon, but it's nice. Democracy is, of course, about people being involved and taking part in a discussion and a debate, regardless of who they are. And my concern, to take it, is precisely that democracy is moving towards being for the elite and those who have the profits to participate, perhaps retired or something else, and that is not necessarily the hard-working dock workers or others, and then it can be difficult to call it a real democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154813	Thank you, sir. Lennart Damsbo-Andersen. There are no more comments. And I would like to welcome Mr. Thomas Danielsen from the Left, Danish Liberal Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329154827	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to the authors of the motion for a resolution for the re-submission of this proposal, which, as has already been mentioned, has been put into a number of electoral challenges lately. But that doesn't change the fact that the Left is about the same place as we were last. With the uncertainty that I do not quite understand the speech of the previous rapporteur, I know that our general position has not changed. We in the Left believe that the proposal deals with some very central and important tasks that we need to discuss. However, we do not believe that the answer lies in setting up a centre for the development of democracy. The Left believes that it is up to the individual parties to involve as many citizens as possible. In the Left, we have done a lot to have thorough dialogues with citizens, associations and interest groups across Denmark. We have already taken many strong initiatives which already promote the development of democracy and rethink the way we have done it in the past. One example of this is the meeting of the people. Everyone here knows how difficult it is to find a place to spend the night and how difficult it can be just to walk around the streets of Allinge, and that is just one example of how committed the Danes are to democracy, not just in relation to the old parties. We also see young people engaging in democracy in a way that was certainly not done when I was a boy. Today, school elections are held in which all schools participate. Parties across the Folketing are also deeply committed to democracy development with both young and old. We meet with citizens across parties, we meet across youth parties and youth organisations, and we actually have a very healthy democracy with a very high turnout. That is why making institutionalisation out of the development of democracy is not something we welcome in the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155057	Thank you. There are a few brief comments to Mr. Thomas Danielsen. The first is from Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155105	Thank you. I understand that this is the same position. I agree with the other good measures that are there. I am very pleased with school elections • an initiative, an institution, if you like, which really makes a difference. But does it not impress the rapporteur that our Nordic neighbours have such centres? A development office in the Folketing, one could also call what is constantly looking at: How can we actually do better? Because I hope that the rapporteur agrees with me that this can actually be done all the time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155145	Yes, of course, and we also believe that things must be done better at all times. If you look at the role of Parliament, we still have plenty of opportunities to do things differently and across parties, both through the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and the Bureau, in the context of referenda and everything else we can engage in how we can engage people. So I see no obstacle to that. But to turn it into an institution is just where we raise the flag and say: we do not approve of that. We believe that it is each of our parties that, together with interested organisations and all that we have of both professional and unprofessional stakeholders, should bear this. We think that is actually going fantastic well in Denmark. That is not to say that it cannot be done better, because of course it can, and of course it will be.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155234	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155237	That is probably the last thing I am most concerned with, namely, is it going as well as it can now? Together with Karsten Lauritzen, the rapporteur's former or probably continued party colleague, but now no longer a member of the Danish Parliament, we have been a few who have really tried to move this agenda in the Bureau and among the group chairmen. Karsten Lauritzen was the group chairman at the time because the basic feeling is that there are actually problems. We will not be seen as confidence-building, we will not be new members of our parties, so they will be smaller and less representative. That is why we need to develop democracy. Couldn't a centre for citizen involvement be one of the ways of trying?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155325	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155328	I don't mind if you want to gather experiences from the Nordic countries, etc. We can certainly do that under the auspices of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, and look at what they are doing and what they are doing. That is what we are doing today. The only question is whether we should make our own institution for this purpose, and we do not think we should. Yes, new thinking is also taking place in the parties, where fewer and fewer members are coming, but there are huge numbers who are strong, highly politically committed actually across parties, because we have also developed as a party. All of a sudden, we are opening up that non-members can attend meetings in the Left, and the same can then go to a team meeting afterwards, or what do I know, which may also be open in the Radical Left. It is a healthy and democratic development that happens in a very positive way if we are asked.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155420	Then it's mr. Uffe Elbæk of the Free Greens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155423	I actually hear that we agree on some of the things and the challenges, but what puzzles me about the Left, and it really does, is the Left's ambition in this area. Because if we recognise that fewer and fewer people want to be members of a political party, and there is a growing distrust between the citizens and our elected representatives, then surely we must do something, and this is something that is being done a little ad hoc. After all, the whole idea of creating a development department is to raise the level of ambition and also the level of knowledge and continuity of the actions we are setting in motion. After all, the rapporteur knows that from time to time we will have a clarification of power and then a democracy commission will be set up and we will do good things in this Chamber. But it is, of course, about getting both the level of ambition and the level of knowledge up and then having a continuity of that work. So I am surprised that the Left has no greater ambition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155528	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155529	For the Left, it is not ambitious in itself to institutionalize a challenge or a problem, and we probably do not really agree on what is really a problem in this House. After all, it is not certain that everyone thinks that, in terms of democratic spectacles, there is a problem that there are not so many members of the individual parties as there have been in the past; suddenly someone is engaging in other ways. So that is also a good example of the training that we need to achieve. This isn't a company where we're in management. One cannot translate one into one, because we have all the mandates and positions of the various parties in the world. So I actually think it's a bit of a simplistic, like Mr. Knox. Uffe Elbæk is talking down our ambition level because we do not agree that an institution should be made out of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155626	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155628	I know, of course, that it is to sharpen the rhetoric to start giving Left characters in relation to the level of ambition. However, I would like to say that when you look into the world and at all the figures that the Left also gets about the state of democracy, you can ask whether we can then agree that we are in a vulnerable situation, more out there than in Denmark, but also in Denmark, and that what is needed is a democratic armament, and that this development department can be an element of it. What does the rapporteur think about this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155708	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155709	In any case, I do not agree that we are in a more vulnerable democratic situation than we are in the world in any way. On the contrary, we have one of the world's strongest democracies, even if we compare ourselves with other countries in Europe. So I actually don't agree with that. Can't we do better then? Yes, I am quite sure we can, and we are very, very happy to cooperate on that, even outside all the official things we have in here, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Bureau and so on. We are very keen to think creatively and come up with ideas and so on, but that does not mean that we have to institutionalize it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155752	Sir. Jan Bjergskov Larsen, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155755	Now I hear the rapporteur talking a lot about democracy, focusing on the political parties. One can either have what one can call a very narrow concept of democracy, or one can have a more broad understanding of democracy. I heard the rapporteur say how to strengthen the political parties, but if you take a broad democratic perspective, could the rapporteur see something in this proposal that would strengthen some very different elements when we talk about democracy? And he is very happy to give some examples.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155833	Here you go, rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155835	But perhaps I should first of all correct the questioner, because it is not really me who makes democracy a question of parties; it is just in the questions I have been given that one has had to deal with whether it is not a problem that there will be fewer members of parties and so on. After all, we in the Left welcome the whole civil society, Association Denmark and all this commitment as a huge force for our democracy and a huge strength for Denmark and the unity of Denmark. We can see in the situation we are currently facing today with Ukrainian refugees who come • how private and individuals contribute. It's a dentist doing voluntary dental work on Ukrainians coming up here. These are people who house Ukrainians. It is associations that go in and help with collection etc. All of this is something that comes from civil society, and it is a good example of something that certainly has nothing to do directly with the individual parties.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155940	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329155942	Thank you. It was nice just to clarify that. I wondered if the Left didn't have that angle too. If we then think in terms of the whole of civil society, is there not, in relation to this proposal for a centre for democracy development and citizen involvement, elements in the work of that centre in terms of both providing good examples and broad knowledge, which the rapporteur can see can actually strengthen broad democracy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160015	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160016	Well, that is also why I do not reject the individual points. So our rejection is whether to institutionalise it. And that is why there are plenty of things here that you can promise and good experiences that you can get from abroad and that abroad can get from us. That is why, in fact, I believe that we also have a lot of potential, but we just have to lift it together and not make an institution out of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160050	Thank you. There are no further comments. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. Then it is the rapporteur of the Socialist People's Party, Mr. Jan Bjergskov Larsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160104	At meetings and among family and friends and acquaintances, and not least in social media, you sometimes hear statements like: Politicians don't listen; my voices don't matter in the big context; I can't identify with those who are in there and should represent me etc; politics has become too complex for me. As a politician, you can sometimes get a little dicked and think: it is actually a little unfair, even unfair, because we ourselves think that we are doing our best. But you can't take an experience from people. They experience what they do. Democracy is dialogue, dialogue and mutual understanding, and it is not to create strife, it is not to dig ditches, and it is not to contribute negatively to the cohesion of our societies. We see ourselves as one of the world's strongest democracies, and yet there are many examples that our way of unfolding our everyday democracy could easily be much better. Often we will focus on precisely the political parties and the way we organise ourselves, but could we not involve people better? But basically, democracy is also about culture. The distance between those who make decisions and those to whom decisions are made is seen to be increasing and the confidence between the elected representatives and the people has diminished. This is a challenge that I think we can all agree with here, and we may also agree that we need to do something about it. We cannot escape the fact that, in general terms, politics has just become far more complex than it was both 5, 10 and 20 years ago. Democracy is like a relationship. This is something that needs to be looked after, nurtured and developed, yes, and is something that we may not be able to get enough of. Democracy is and must be constantly changing, especially as a result of the challenges and developments that are taking place in society both nationally and internationally. This is, for example, the case. on technology development, globalisation, population growth, most recently covid and yes, the war in Europe. Specifically, with the proposal from the Free Greens, the Radical Left, the Enhedslisten, the Alternative and the SF, we want to establish a centre which, with various tools and at different levels, must maintain and strengthen democracy and citizen involvement in Denmark with everything from research into new models of citizen involvement and democracy development to the implementation of very concrete and inclusive projects. Increased involvement leads to increased co-existence, ensuring that decisions will enjoy greater and wider acceptance and are robust and, above all, effective, and this is very much needed. Of course, we from the SF support the proposal and have listened positively to the fact that many other parties in this Chamber agree with the intention. I certainly hope that we can agree to continue working on it so that we can succeed in doing so. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160415	Thank you. And there is a brief comment from Mr. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160417	That is really just a brief comment, because I just want to thank you for your speech. It was nice to hear SF be so clear about the support for it. So my only question really relates to the need to continue working on it. In other words, we have heard from the Social Democrats that further practicalisation would be a good thing. We also heard from the Left that, although they did not want to institutionalize this type of work, there were nevertheless tasks in the way it was described, which the Left also considered important. So could the rapporteur from the SF say a little about what the SF is thinking about when we develop it before it comes to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160506	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160507	That is a good question, especially when you do not have many years on the back of this Chamber, in other words in relation to how you work. In practical terms, however, I think that the rapporteurs need to sit down, in other words take some kind of meeting, because I think it is more the fear of institutionalising this democracy which may stand in the way of it and that we are, in fact, far along the way, I believe, agreed on the content. So it might be good to have a meeting where some facilitate it in a good way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160537	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160539	I just have a small subtle follow-up question: doesn't SF think that it would be a good idea for us to also invite the rapporteurs from those parties who were perhaps at first a little more lukewarm in relation to the proposal, so that they could get a little more warmer on it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160553	Oh, yeah! That is precisely in the spirit of democracy. So a big yes to the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160600	Thank you. Then there are no more brief comments. Thank you to the SF rapporteur. Then it is the rapporteur for the Radical Left. Here you go, Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329160613	Thank you. Thank you for being here again, among other things. to my good co-author here, Uffe Elbæk. It is not quite so often that I come to the Parliamentary Chamber for debates any longer, unfortunately, you can sometimes say. I am incredibly pleased to be here on this subject, which we are already doing. Because I've also said that it's, of course, a little provocative that politics on some stretches has broken up a bit. But it is about this, which we discussed before, that confidence in us as elected representatives is low and it is not about where you are in relation to the used car dealers. But the basic confidence that we are making meaningful decisions is, of course, crucial to confidence in democracy. And then there is an ever-lower proportion of Danes who are engaged in a political party, but I also agree with the rapporteur of the Left that there is a lot of commitment. How, then, is it translated into confidence that it can be carried out through democratic institutions and that it will not be a division that we cultivate? I actually hear a common interest and curiosity about this. For me, it is just a matter of how we may need to inject new oxygen into our democratic institutions. On a day like today, I believe that we have all heard the President of Ukraine talking to us about the challenge of democracy that we face in Europe, which Russia's invasion inspires, and I thought first of all: 'Oh, it is far too small to discuss it now on such a day. On the other hand, it is vitally important that we actually do this. Because that's what's at stake. And that responsibility lies with us. We must dare to think new things, and we must continue to focus on how to develop our democratic institutions. Because if we want to, and I also heard from the Social Democrat rapporteur, 'greatly and sincerely to involve and engage more citizens, it is absolutely crucial that we continue to look for new opportunities for citizen involvement where this makes sense. And that, of course, is where we may disagree a little about how it does it. I am glad that we are discussing not only this proposal, which concerns the establishment of a centre for democracy development and citizen involvement, but also the proposal for this attempt at citizenship in the Folketing later on. Both proposals are designed to strengthen democracy and what is probably called the democratic dialogue with a slightly fainted expression. We are taking part in the Radical Left in resubmitting this proposal, because it was tabled in 2019, but it did not reach consideration. So there were several of us who agreed on this. It's also about strengthening the Folketing. For me, it is certainly about strengthening the Folketing, that is, our institution, in practice. This does not mean that we need to institutionalise it further, but to have a place where development and not operation are specifically highlighted, because there is a lot of that here in our Parliament. All our Nordic neighbors have something similar. For me, this indicates that we are lagging behind in the democracy development account in Denmark. We pride ourselves on it and may tell out in the world that we have the best at all, but it may be a bit shadowy for there to actually be opportunities to develop it. This does not mean that our democracy is not functioning properly; it is incredibly well functioning. But it's just not quite perfect, and it never will be. But the British think tank Economist Intelligence Unit has published an annual temperature measurement on the world's democracies, and we are doing the worst of the Nordic countries. We score lower on civil rights, political culture and openness and transparency in relation to the way in which the government operates. So there is potential for improvement, both in our democracy and also in the way we make policy. We therefore believe that we should constantly work on how the framework will improve, so that more people are involved and, above all, experience that they will be heard and involved. So the question is, how do we do that? This proposal to set up a centre for democracy development and citizen involvement is our bid. It's not one that's been over a night. In fact, we have been working on this quite thoroughly for a few years. Is that an answer? I don't think it is, but we need to be able to try our way forward. I believe that we need to create more politics with those involved, and that is the citizens. And the first step on the road is this proposal. It's just that democracy is for everyone. It is an ideal that is never achieved, and that is why we must constantly strive to achieve it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161140	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161143	I agree with the words of the radical rapporteur. What I just want to ask you is, of course, the fact that, as I said, the proposal was put forward in the session 2018-19. Then came the election. And one of the things I've been thinking about, after we've retabled it, is what the world looks like today. We have just heard the Ukrainian President speak to us in the Landstingshall here over dinner, and I simply think that there is such a serious matter here. For me, it's much bigger than the one about how it's to be organized. On the one hand, this is about standing up for our democratic institutions and, on the other hand, about developing them at the same time. So what does the rapporteur think about the need for us, as the world looks like, to hold these discussions?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161241	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161242	I very much agree, and that is also why I could not help getting what we were dealing with today to become infected, because what we are facing is landmark; what Ukraine is facing. And that fight for freedom is also a fight for the democracy we know in Europe. That's why it's serious. I would like to pick out the question and perhaps it was a little bit to follow up on the question that was also put to the SF rapporteur to take it positive. I really think that both the Social Democrats and the Left are actually in favour of some good proposals on where action could also be taken. My suggestion is that all those parties are in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. Let us go in there with a very specific proposal on how we could do this, perhaps to accommodate the fact that the Left should not think that it is too institutionalised. We need to find a financial framework in the Folketing in which the Socialists can also be in, and then we can get on with it. I think we should, because it is serious now, and we should take that on board here in the Folketing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161349	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161351	In fact, I believe that the rapporteur has an insanely important such collection and conclusion at this stage in the debate. In fact, I hear that there is an interest and seriousness in relation to the challenge facing us across the parties, in other words those who have now been up to say something. I think we should take the medicine ourselves and say that we cannot then develop this proposal with as many votes involved as possible. Of course, people can just say no. But that could certainly be my ambition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161426	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161426-2	I share that, and that is why I am trying to welcome it here, because I really have a real will and curiosity to get on with this. And then, as the rapporteur says, we must also be willing to move away from our very specific ideas. By the way, I would like to add that I welcome from the Enhedslisten, which also supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161453	Thank you to Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen. We now turn to the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party, Mrs Mai Mercado. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161509	Thank you, President. Today we are debating a motion for a resolution on the establishment of a centre for the development of democracy and citizen involvement. It is a partial re-submission, and when it was the first time, we rejected it nicely. And we are also making a nice rejection today. It is about believing that democracy can be promoted and that citizen involvement can also be promoted without the need to create a national central government centre. Some are concerned about the development of democracy, but the proposers themselves also mention that we must not forget that we have one of the highest levels of turnout in Europe. And when you think about it, a lot of people are involved in our democracy not necessarily as in the old days, when many were members of a party, but the commitment is emerging in new ways. That is why it is very good that such a motion for a resolution is being tabled, but we do believe that there are already a number of mechanisms that help both to ensure, but actually also to promote democratic dialogue between citizens and politicians. An example of this may be the tradition of the meeting of the people that has arisen. After all, we have the big public meeting at Bornholm, but in the wake of the public meeting at Bornholm, a number of thematic public meetings have emerged. One could mention the Culture Council, the EU People's Meeting, the Food People's Meeting and the Youth People's Meeting. And then there are all the other local public meetings. There is the Folk Meeting Møn and the Funen People's Meeting, in which I myself take part with great pleasure. Then there is also an opportunity for you to commit yourself by writing a citizen's proposal which, if you get 50,000 backing votes to it, you can send directly to the Parliamentary Assembly. There are school elections in the municipalities, where youth organisations debate diligently and where elections are held. And there is also the Day of Democracy here at Christiansborg, where young people can come in and be politicians for a day. There are school classes that come in on a tour, and there are 9th classes and other school pupils who come in here and are internship for a week or so. There is citizenship day where we open the doors and show the parties and also show Christiansborg. And then, in fact, there was the Democracy Commission from the Danish Youth Council, DUF, which showed that it is actually more than 90 per cent. of all the Danes who engage in an association with all that it involves. And it is fine in that report that the high association commitment is basically very strong for democracy. There is the cultural night, where everyone can come in and experience Christiansborg Friday before the autumn holiday. And then we actually work with different models to open up Christiansborg more with the acquisition of the National Archives and the building. But there are already plans in the pipeline to make it better and easier to have a democratic conversation between the citizens and the elected representatives. In fact, there is also the media. You might want them to take on more responsibility, but there is a lot going on locally. I can give you an example from my own duckam, TV 2 Funen, who created a concept that they had for the municipal elections and for the last parliamentary elections, and which they carry forward to the next parliamentary elections, which they call the "Stemmerne." Here they convey in a wonderfully good way and at eye level policy to young people. There were also local debates in the municipalities of Funen during the last municipal elections, which were then shown in the evening on TV 2 Funen. So it's just to say that the media are also concerned about democratic conversation and citizen involvement. So with these several handfuls of examples, I actually think there's a lot going on locally. But yes, it happens in a way where it doesn't necessarily happen from the top down, but where it actually happens from the bottom up, and we think it has a really, really good and positive meaning. So commend the motion for a resolution. We are in this round and we are delighted with all the things that are already happening locally.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161935	Thank you. There are several brief comments. It's first, sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329161938	At least it's clear that we look out of different windows. I hear from the Conservatives that the party thinks that things are going well, and they point out a whole series of concrete examples that it has hardly been better, but what we are discussing is that we can see that fewer and fewer people want to be members of a political party, and the way we have organised our democracy today is that it is the parties that have to represent the people. The people obviously do not want to be part of the parties, plus the fact that there is a growing distrust between citizens on the one hand and politicians on the other. On the one hand, you want to say that you live in a nice country, and that it is going really well I want to, and there are plenty of good examples that things are going well too, but on the other hand there are also some underlying things that this addresses, namely that we must continue to develop our democratic institutions. What does the rapporteur think about this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162045	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162046	We are thinking that it is not necessarily a state organisation that is the solution. It is true that fewer people are involved in the political parties. I mentioned that myself in my speech. It is also true that confidence in our elected representatives is declining. However, a good way to get rid of this distrust is when we, as politicians, engage where the citizens are, for example at these local public meetings, where we come out, take the debates, get the inputs and thus ensure that there is a more direct link between citizens and politicians. Then it may well be that it happens in a slightly different way than it did in the past. In fact, I believe that in some stretches this is done in a slightly more direct way than in the past, because in the past there were many who did not join a party, but now they have the opportunity to be heard by using some of the many channels that are today and which were not there at the time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162143	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162144	I think that once we start talking concretely about it, we can probably meet each other. And the whole idea of this development department is to take some of these initiatives, but do it more continuously and not least anchor it here in the Folketing. It is basically to protect the Folketing that this idea has been born at all. It is simply saying that we are such an important democratic institution, and that is precisely why it must continue to develop.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162219	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162219-2	We just feel basically that we believe that today there are good channels for engaging, such as these many different public meetings and the fact that you can get in touch with a politician relatively quickly either via e-mail or through social media. Then this is the conversation that we must work towards. But I do not have the impression that channels are missing, but it is a question of getting people to use those channels. I just don't think a government organization is what it takes to get more people involved. It is more that we go out and grab people than go out from the top down to get people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162303	Thank you. Then it's mr. Jan Bjergskov Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162304	Thank you. Before we talk about the fact that a national centre is something dangerous, I would say that I was just sitting here and spending half a minute seeing that we have a national centre for ethics, for the prevention of extremism, for mental health, for climate research and also for a national centre for green energy, etc. So something that is important to us, we actually choose as a society to say that we need a national centre for. I understand that this is a different kind of national centre, but it is still a matter of giving priority to something that we think is important. The rapporteur talks about a democratic conversation, but in several of the examples I hear, a democratic conversation becomes something with politicians. So, from the SF's point of view, we would like a democratic conversation to be something that is going on everywhere, at all levels, that is how we are actually together. I could mention something, for example. about school choices: There is simply no time to have a dialogue at school. You can have a school choice, you can't have a time in school. But my question to the rapporteur is this: are there any of the other national centres, but which the rapporteur considers superfluous?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162421	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162421-2	Probably.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162428	Is there a follow-up question, sir? Jan Røgskov Larsen? Mai Mercado It is given).
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162431	Democracy is actually also to have participation in your own work, just to take something. If you ask many of the public employees, many will think that with the focus that has been on developing your work, seeking pools, you have a focus that is far removed from the professional environments. What is the rapporteur's view of democracy when it comes to influencing his own work? And does the rapporteur consider this to be an important element in relation to this centre as well?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162507	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162508	Yes, of course, it is important to have an influence on your own work. In other words, you can find surveys without just being able to them by heart that the greater the influence you have on your own work, the greater the joy of work there too. So it's perfectly natural. I believe that what might be the difference between the questioner and myself may well be that we do not necessarily see the same view that it is the state that needs to go in again and lift it through a state centre, but that one can also have confidence in the citizens; that very many citizens would like to engage, preferably through new ways, new channels. And that's what we're hugging about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162550	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162553	Perhaps we should then start by denying something: is the Folketing a state company? No. Is an office in the Folketing a state corporation (Mai Mercado State Center)? I don't think so either. I hope the rapporteur agrees with that. It's a parliament center. It is the Folketing that wanted an office that was a centre for democracy development just before we run into something that just splits the debate and gets it far away from what it really is about and which is how we develop our democracy. That is why I should like to ask: does the rapporteur know about the Nordic experience of having similar offices, development offices?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162630	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162631	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162632	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162633	Would the rapporteur not like to learn about this and perhaps take it in? It is also completely unolenic; it is quite fair. But that is the basis on which we have put forward this proposal. It is because other Nordic countries have a lot of good experience with it, and it benefits citizens. So everything about democracy from the bottom up, as the rapporteur really said, could actually get better space, because that is what this is all about. Perhaps we could agree in the good spirit that we had earlier on, since the rapporteur is a member of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, I know that we here mixed up some of those experiences. Perhaps we could raise the common knowledge base fairly; that is what is needed and draw some experience that we could bring into the Folketing and help to develop our democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162722	Thank you. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162722-2	In other words, I fully agree with what the Social Democrats also said earlier: that it is perhaps a post office too early to have a resolution on the creation of a state centre. However, we are happy to enter into a debate in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure on how to strengthen democracy absolutely at any time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162744	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party. Then it is the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party, and that is Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329162753	As has already been said, this resolution is, after all, one of the proposals made in 2015 and 2019. In the Danish People's Party we find it basically sympathetic that there is a focus on how we can make increased citizen involvement and how we can develop our democracy. It is always important that we continually try to activate citizens' commitment to our society and ensure that there is also a good democratic understanding that we are as we are today and where we are going as a country. With this, a new centre is proposed to link citizen involvement to political processes and research and experiment and create new models. This all sounds really positive, and we agree that the intention can be good. However, we also feel that it is perhaps a little overtaking another initiative which is already under way, and that is that a new clarification of power needs to be carried out. I am not in committee, that proposal has been passed on by a colleague. But this is something that I have the impression that everyone agrees must be done. The final explanation of power is back from the last millennium, around the turn of the millennium, so there is a need for an update of the basis so that you can take the discussion on how power is placed in Denmark. What are the democratic conditions, how do we use the media, what about social media? There are plenty of things that are involved, and these are some of the things that are highlighted in the resolution. But they also overlap a little. Perhaps we owe it to those who are following out there to say that a process of power is such a kind of testing of democracy, which is also what the proposal proposes. However, the question is whether there should be two parallel initiatives. Perhaps I have a little more doubts about that. For some of the themes that need to be looked at in the elucidation of power are among others. the institutions of the people's regime and the political processes as one stick. Another stick is called participation in the democratic community and civil society. A third stick is called technology and the development of the media in the democratic conversation. These are, in fact, some of the same things that are highlighted in this motion for a resolution. So in the Danish People's Party, we feel that when we continuously get results from these researchers who have to sit with the investigation of power, it is obvious that we are also constantly taking initiatives that might strengthen the democratic conversation or citizen involvement and the development of democracy, which is precisely what is the focus of this proposal. However, I would also like to say that, when it comes to the lack of commitment to our parties, which, of course, forms the basis of democracy, I agree with that, we may also have to look inwards. Now, for example, I am. even the tax rapporteur, sitting as a citizen out there, saying that I think our tax system should be changed. But no one can figure it out. I think there's quite a few people in here who can figure it out. It is not something that motivates you to sit as a citizen and think that now I have to join a party, because now I have to change our tax system. Nobody can figure it out. In fact, that is why I have a motion for a resolution on later today, which is quite simply about the need to simplify our tax system. We may agree or disagree that the tax burden must be up or down, but it must be simpler. We should be able to agree on that. Are we getting more simple legislation? It's up to us to do it. I also think that people are more motivated to see themselves in the legislation and perhaps to say that OK, I think we should actually go along this road, or some think we should go another way. But when we've been patching up the patch for decades, when all parties are guilty of it, including my own party, it's not to push the responsibility away from me... nor do we motivate people to take responsibility and join a party and try to join the Folketing, a city council or regional council, or whatever it may be. There are many places where decisions are made. So we also have to look inwards and see how we can make it more interesting to be involved in making decisions. I personally do not think that this has been made any easier, even where I myself have been involved in making some decisions. Look at our tax system. It's kind of like winning the lottery when we open our annual statement. Nobody knows why we get money back or have to pay money. At least we could start with that. That's one of the things. But unfortunately, we are going to reject this proposal. Not because we agree with the intentions of it, but because we see this exposition of power coming, i.e. if we shouldn't take it first and then have some experience. Some people are looking at it too. They can come up with proposals, and then you can take some good discussions from that. So we are, for example. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are not opposed to the intentions of this, and we are, in fact, open to discussing it further in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. So it is not me personally, but my group chairman who will take it. I think it's perfectly obvious that you do it, both on the basis of this, but that you do it continuously. Those were supposed to be the words.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163210	Thank you. There are a few brief comments. First, it's sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163211	First of all, I would like to say that I always find it interesting to hear the rapporteur's speech. There are good shades and there are good perspectives. It's just a cadeau from colleague to colleague I'm coming with. However, the question raised by the rapporteur is whether the updating of the information on power, which we are currently debating, cannot really replace the proposal we are debating today. I would just like to say that, with regard to the update of the investigation of power, we are talking about achieving results within a period of three to five years. And some of what we have just problematized in the round of negotiations that we are in now is how we can anchor this update of the explanation of power in the Folketing, so get it close to our everyday lives so that we can take these debates on a regular basis. That would be precisely what such a development department could have done if it had existed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163319	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163319-2	It is true that it takes time to make such an explanation of power, but it does indeed take time to set up such an institution, not in the state, but under the Folketing. I am fully in favour of the premise that it is we who will not sit at the end of the table, but in any case will be governing what is to be researched. However, I would also like to point out that, in such a power analysis, some results can be achieved on an ongoing basis. Of course, you don't have to wait until such a huge battle that has to be at the very end, and then the whole package comes in eight ring binders, and we all drown in material. It should also be the case that they were able to come up with results on an ongoing basis and say where the shoe prints, or that they have found some good initiatives or gained some experience from, for example. Sweden, which has been mentioned. It is certainly my dream for such an explanation of power that something can also be brought up on a regular basis so that it does not have to take five years. Because then what you are looking at can almost also become obsolete, and that is of course not the intention.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163405	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163406	As I imagine this development department or this center, such a power extraction update could very well be right there, but we can take that discussion at another time. What I just want to emphasise is that I hear the rapporteur saying that the rapporteur's party will be actively involved in debating this when it lands in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, and I am just really pleased about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163434	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163436	Absolutely. After all, there are no opposing interests. After all, none of us have the opposite incentive: we must now find a way of undermining democracy. We all have the same interest. I have also heard this from the other rapporteurs who have been on the floor, so I think it is obvious that we should continue to discuss it under the auspices of the committee, whether we can find something in which everyone can see themselves. We should be able to find out.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163457	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163458	Thank you very much to the rapporteur for really fine reflections. I agree, I also think that this is something that we are all interested in, and then we just come in from different sides and have different solutions. But I am also really concerned about what is happening with the investigation of power, and again, I have been sitting with the former rapporteur Karsten Lauritzen in the past when he was still in the Folketing to see how to get it anchored. I know that the rapporteur's party has also been strongly involved in this Parliament. This is currently being negotiated by the Minister for Research. That is precisely where this centre will be, if I may say so, the committee, the place we are now missing. And then I hope that in the discussions on the ad hoc committee that I know will be discussed, we can incorporate some of these things, at least until we perhaps adopt something similar or something else. In any case, I am very pleased with the rapporteur's observation that this must be something that we can agree to continue working on in one form or another and in the context of the investigation of power.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163606	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163606-2	I actually agree with you very much, and I would also like to say to you that I now mentioned that the final explanation of power is back from the turn of the century. And in order not to necessarily have to be 20 years apart each time, it might well be that we should find a model, so that it also may not run like that, but at least it comes a little more often. Because a lot can happen in a democracy of 20 years. There may be many shifts of power, and social media have emerged. There has been a great deal of happening in the time since the last elucidation of power. So in addition to the fact that we're starting it now, and an explanation of power is super good, you could find another model, so you'll also have a regular look at it. It could be another hybrid of this motion for a resolution and something else. I will certainly not deny that. So let us take a look at the work of the committee or the UFO, as the Rules Committee says, how to achieve that balance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163649	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163650	Thank you so much for that statement. I feel what's a hybrid of this, for besides the fact that a lot of things happen both with power and democracy, there are many things happening around us in other countries. It was precisely in order to have a place that constantly draws on the experience so that we can learn from both the good and, moreover, the bad experiences that are being done elsewhere. You can get a lot smarter from that, too. I find that necessary, and I can also hear that the rapporteur is doing something continuous, something that holds on to it. So let us look at it together. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163726	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163728	Thank you. Well, that was not a question, but there should not be a question either; it is also a dialogue many times, isn't it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163734	It's so good. There are no more brief comments. So thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party, and I should like to see something. 'Cause I saw it was sir. Jens Rohde, who was going to be on the platform, and that the rapporteur for the authors of the proposals is here now, and we usually end up with that. So that's why I was wondering. Okay, then I'll leave it to Jens Rohde, and then I'll round it off eventually). So welcome to the rapporteur of the Christian Democrats. Here you go, sir. Jens Rohde.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329163820	Thank you. Well, I feel that way about Mr. Knox. Uffe Elbæk, that I love that we have a member here in the Danish Parliament who dares to come up with ideas, and so always challenges, we must say, the reactionary part of my self, who is getting stronger with age. This is the way things happen every once in a while, you have to admit. But that does not mean that every time I think it hits right in the right direction. 'Cause I kind of have a lot of sympathy for Mr. Uffe Elbæk has been trying to push things and develop new ways of creating citizen participation and democracy, and I have the greatest respect for that. But I find it a little bit difficult that there is a tendency, which I actually think is a little in the Radical Left, to keep telling that democracy is broken and now to use Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen's words and I think we should be a little cautious. Because I actually believe that our democracy is better than its reputation. The fact that people do not engage in parties does not necessarily mean that they do not necessarily engage in politics, and I doubt it, and it is now just because it has been used here as an argument that people are less and less joining the parties that a centre for democracy development, as I see it, will cause people to join the parties. So I have a little bit of difficulty in seeing what the purpose here is exactly, that is, what it's going to lead to, and I also have a little bit of difficulty in seeing that later we'll also have to discuss citizens' things • who it is that should sit there and who should appoint it. Because a democracy becomes stronger by getting a lot of appointments? Then it is always the case when we do things like this that it is the Minister who appoints seven Members and some appoint four Members and something like that. Does that make our democracy stronger? Or is it really just such a democratic pseudo-body for the few where it is the saints of the last days who sit and discuss with each other? Well, who's it gonna be for? I have a fear that something like this will be very introverted, and that is why I am actually not out of displeasure, because I would very much like to listen to both the ideas, but also the solutions to how it could then become different and very sceptical about that kind of thing, just as I know, as Mrs Carsten Nielsen knows, because we have discussed it many times, so basically is against the citizen's proposal institution, and I am, because I believe that it promotes individual democracy. It sounds so great that you can collect signatures and that you can engage people in this way, but it also comes with a price, namely that in here we have to relate to incredibly many individual case focussing, where our task is to be holistic. I think we all know what it is like to stand on this platform of the Danish Parliament and that, when there are plenty of people who have committed themselves to some citizen's proposal, you hardly have the heart to say no to the citizen's proposal, even though it may be imprecise, and we have to say that we are going into some general considerations where the prerequisites are not really there if it is to be a higher unit. I have a problem with that, but now I am also so heretical that I am also against referendums, so perhaps one would say that I am not democratic at all, and I know that the Danish People's Party loves referendums. But it is actually from that analysis that a democracy must be measured by its ability to protect minorities, and in a referendum that sounds so good and democratic, the minority, which typically consists of 48%. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware of the fact that the Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level of emissions from motor vehicles has not been accepted by the Commission. by the people have been left on the platform. So when things just sound alluring, I think they require some really good deeper spade, and I'd like to discuss them before I confess whether I'm going to say boo or boo to this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164326	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164337	After all, the rapporteur is already embarking on the debate on the subject we will have to deal with afterwards, namely a citizen's thing. For what we are discussing now is, as I have said, a centre for democracy development, and there is the whole idea of strengthening the institution in which we stand now; it is to strengthen and further develop the Folketing as an institution in relation to the democratic task that we are once set up in the world to carry out. What is the purpose of the Centre is, in fact, to say: how can we ensure that there remains a good and trusting relationship between citizens on the one hand and us elected representatives on the other? Can we make decisions in new and better and wiser ways than the way we do it today? Can we discuss thematics more nuanced and more involved than we do today? That is the ambition of the centre.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164435	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164436	I'm not entirely convinced that the center will lead to that. And again: These are very elastic and subjective terms, i.e. more qualified. But we have to recognise that politics is not rational. What's rational for Mr. Knox? Uffe Elbæk is not necessarily rational to me. We bring all our bags and all our points of view, and then these rationals that we each have must be on a table, and we must then negotiate on that, and it will always be a compromise that never completely meets Mr. Uffe Elbæk's rationals and never fulfill my rationals fully, but which hopefully is something we can all see ourselves in. But it will always be a kindergarten or a madhouse or something, because that's why we're here. It cannot be such a rational approach to everything, which is why I think that we should be extremely careful in policy to use what is called a qualified and better way of doing things. I have been sitting in the European Parliament for ten years now, and that is a great deal, but I would like to say from the platform here that I think the Folketing is working extremely well, and I have some extremely talented and qualified colleagues who are doing their best.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164557	Thank you. Then it's mr. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164559	I can also sign that I have some qualified colleagues and that we are doing very well. But my approach is that we can do better, and what sometimes becomes our common story is that the version of the Folketing that we know today is the best possible and that it can never get better. And there I look out into the world and see that there are other parliaments doing it in other ways, and some of the ways they do it we can learn from. So how the hell do we get that knowledge in and gather it and make it concrete and usable in parliament? That's what the center's job is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164639	Then it is the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164640	Well, I totally agree with that. I have been in and occupied with many parliaments through my work in the Committee on Civil Liberties in the European Parliament, and you can always draw lessons and lessons. But once again it is also a question of whether you do it yourself or whether it is a centre that should do it. Again: I would not just say that this is a bad idea, but I lack clarity about the method and foundation of such a centre in order to be able to see whether it actually makes a difference in terms of the objective that we, of course, share in terms of a well-functioning democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164724	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164728	I think that these are some smashing reflections that the rapporteur has. I cannot personally conclude, for example. The citizens' proposals are still under way. The individual democracy was probably there already, but is it getting better or is it getting worse? I'm not sure yet either. I am a bit of a tester and, by the way, am very flawed, and I just think that we should be able to be like democracy, in other words, test things a little. And it may be that this isn't entirely clear, because it's a little about symptoms and causes and where we do something about it. Can an office in the Folketing, a centre for citizen involvement, get more people into the parties? Definitely not; I don't think so either. But may that cause some others to get some voices and some recognition that might not otherwise have been gained, because one could reap the experience from elsewhere. That, at least, is the idea inspired by other countries. But my question is actually very specific. Could we use it here and would the rapporteur be interested in us using it here to say: let us try to gain a common experience in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure or somewhere else that we saw, I do not know, held some seminars on or something where we were in fact working together more on what we could work towards?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164846	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164848	In this context, I can recommend internships in the parliaments of other countries, and incidentally, I also think that any member of parliament as a duty should sit at least five years in the European Parliament, because there one really learns to overcome each other's differences, believe it or not, because they are so enormous. So again, every time I bump into that one, we're gonna say raggy brains from Uffe Elbæk, I'm gonna try to pull out a can opener like that, trying to open my brain to tell me not to be that old and reactionary. So I'd like to open up my mind and help try new things off and stuff like that, but I certainly need to have more of a hold on it before I can say how I want to put my position specifically on the resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164944	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329164945	I fully understand that, and how good it is with traineeships in another Parliament, not to mention the European Parliament, for which I myself have worked, however, was not elected. It's a huge experience. Why do we not take internships in other parliaments? That's probably because we're all full anyway. We come to visit, but the thing about actually digging into how they work is an inspiration that we could bring into the work where we get a little bit smarter on what it really is we could do here. I hear that as a commitment to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329165018	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329165020	Then it is just a question of whether the foreign politicians have time to have interns visiting from the Danish Parliament. But there could be something interesting in some exchange. In other words, you could actually seek some cooperation in more institutionalized form with other parliaments, which might also want to seek some inspiration. I think that could be extremely, very exciting. Speaking of the difficult word institutionalization, it reminds me of a 1979 Olsen gang film in which they stand in the Olsen gang on the bucket and have to get combative before they learn to say the word rehabilitation. It brought out a little bit of memories in the debate before, sir. Uffe Elbæk, to that movie, and it also led to something nice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329165107	Then we just got the Olsen gang, too. Thank you, sir. Jens Rohde. Then we have reached the rapporteur for the proposers. Here you go, sir. Uffe Elbæk of the Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329165125	Thank you. Thank you, too, for the debate. I think we've gotten around really well at all altitudes by now. So I figured I'd spend a little time just rewinding the movie. Where did this idea even come from? What were the arguments at the time when we presented it back in the collection 2018-19? It was actually a very simple idea in my optics a really good simple idea. All major, well-functioning and serious companies, when you look at society, have a development department, that is, a place where you constantly and continuously look at how to do things better, and whether you can learn from someone who might do it in a completely different way and has actually broken the code on a given issue, and where you documented experiments, make collections, create debate in the organisation etc. etc. It was the thinking that was then passed on to the Folketing, because the Folketing is our democracy's largest company. So why don't we have a development department inside the largest company in democracy? And, as the radical rapporteur also pointed out, our colleagues in Norway and Sweden have something similar to this, in other words, a place where we are constantly considering whether we can make it smarter, smarter, more fun and more gifted. It was really out of it that the idea also grew inspired by the development department that the Ministry of Business had at the time, called MindLab, which became almost notoriously world famous because a ministry created a development department. All the other ministries thought that such a case there would also like to have where we are, because you could feel that this was worthwhile and that employees were put into a new framework where they could discuss in a new way, which gave them better ideas. That was the reason why we proposed it at the time. Then there was the whole package. Well, what was the problem we had to address? Well, we had to address the fact that fewer and fewer people wanted to be members of a political party, as has also been mentioned in this Chamber today, which is the whole foundation and foundation of the way we have organised the Folketing. So we have a problem and we have a problem with the citizens thinking that they have less and less confidence in us elected representatives. The rapporteur for the Christian Democrats and also the rapporteur for the Conservatives said that there are plenty of good things going on, and I fully agree. But the problem is: how do we stand up for the Folketing as an institution? And how do we develop it? It was the backdrop back then. And then I thought, "Well, when I get up today and I'm doing this little post, I think the background has just become a lot more serious and serious. Since 2019 we have seen a development in Poland, we have seen a development in Hungary, and we have seen developments also in France and Italy, which cause me concern. We've seen the storm at the United States Congress. And now we stand here today and have heard a speech from the Ukrainian President. I think it's very serious. When you look at the figures and look at how many people today actually live in what you might call well-functioning democracies, you can see that we are down somewhere between 5% and 8%. of the world's population living in what is called well-functioning democracies. And the last report from Freedom House said that there had been a backward step in democracies in 83 countries • only one country was progressing in, and all others were the status quo. It is actually with this perspective that I am talking about this centre for democracy development and citizen involvement. I think that in Denmark we should be world champions of democracy and democracy. And where, in other discussions due to the war in Ukraine, we are talking about military armament, I think this is about democratic armament. So I hope that now I have listened to the speeches that have been made that when we talk the substance of it and the issues in it, there is a common curiosity. I am not saying that we then agree on what to do, but there is a common curiosity. I have also heard that several of my fellow rapporteurs have said that they will, of course, look at it seriously when it comes back to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. What then came of curls along the way was, if we couldn't actually try to develop this together... those who wanted to do it... and then say: Now we've reached this level. It may be that something has to change and something has to be cut. Some people actually have a better idea than us who have now put it forward. I totally agree with that. Now I look down at both the SF and the Social Democracy and the Radical Left and the Danish People's Party and the Christian Democrats and the Left and the Conservatives, and then I think: can we not do this together? At least that's the intention. So I think that the parties that have now been behind this proposal should stick their heads together very quickly and then look at how we get our other colleagues into it. Well, at least they're gonna need the invitation. And then we have to put it before the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and see if it has its way on the ground. Then I would just like to say to all of us that there is also a specific timing in this. If this is to be realized, there's also something that's pushing us on time right now. It is, of course, that the National Archives have moved out of their premises on the other side of the farm. So if we could imagine that, among other things, we... could use some of the premises for such a centre for democracy development, so it is a unique opportunity, and it will not come back again if we want to set up such a centre in the framework of the Folketing. So there's also a very specific time factor in relation to this work. So I would like to thank you for the debate. I am quite sure that this has its course on the ground, and I look forward to us getting together quickly from the respective parties that are behind it and looking at how to take the next step forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329165830	Thank you. And there is a brief comment from Mr. Jens Rohde.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329165833	It is a bit of an outline of the things that we can all see have happened both in Italy and in many different places in Europe over the past many years, and the answer and analysis I do not think should be found in such a democracy development institution. Now Mrs Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen is sitting up there, and in 1998 when Mrs Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen had become Minister for Culture, she gave an interview, either to Politiken or Information, where she used the expression "the cows" as an illustration of some of the changes that are taking place in society and in which people find it very difficult to go along with it, and there has been a great deal of juice since 1998. This is something in which I believe and it does not have so much to do with the conversation as with our responsibility to ensure a certain equality, a certain security, to do, that is to say, concrete political decisions in which we care about people's lives and not just about the strategy to deal with it is more important than having set up some kind of democracy and citizen involvement centre. But it is just to say that I do not believe that the major crises can be solved with such a centre.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329165958	And then I'll remind you that swearing words, whether they're fake words or whatever they are, don't belong in the Assembly Hall. Jens Rohde did I say a swear word?). Here you go, sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170011	Oh, I love my colleague down there. And now we have also involved guests of the Folketing in the debate. It's going very well. We're in the process of developing the democratic conversation, so thank you for that. And with all the considerations that the Christian Democrats have also made along the way, I am sure that it can be a real, really exciting discussion when we invite to find out how we do this even better and more focused. I'm pretty sure that the center isn't the solution to everything, but it's an element in keeping us up on our toes in here in the Folketing and in that we make our work smarter and smarter and more interesting, also for those who listen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170100	Sir. Jens Rohde, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170103	Well, I'm really sorry I have no idea what a swearing word I've said, but sometimes it gets out of my mouth. I also have some fellow party members who can constantly point out that I might perhaps moderate my language at times, so I will try that. But here I simply do not know what I have said out of swear words. It was certainly not intended, but thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170124	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170129	I don't know if I should comment on that, other than that language is a funny size.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170135	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you, sir. Uffe Elbæk. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170148	As you know, there is no minister in this area; it is Parliament's own responsibility. I will listen carefully to the debate on the proposal, which is of course to be discussed in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. The debate has been opened, and the first to speak is Mr Beazley. Lennart Damsbo-Andersen from the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170223	Thank you for that, President. Now a minister just came in, but it wasn't for us. After all, this proposal for an attempt at citizenship is also a re-submission of a re-submission, so I do not think there is any reason to draw the tension from the attitude of the Social Democrats towards the proposal to do a citizen's thing. Like the last time and the last time we had debates in this Chamber, we are positive about ensuring that the citizens are interviewed and involved, but we cannot support the proposal. As parliamentary politicians, we have a huge responsibility to ensure that what we talk about and decide reflects the thoughts and trends that are out there in society, and therefore it is also very good that we are actually active in debates and activities, both in here and around the country, at public meetings and meetings in all sorts of shades and that there is openness and involvement in the legislative process that we all know about. A citizen's thing may well be a new way to go, and it is also already being tested in relation to the climate area, where a climate citizen's thing is currently working to advise the Folketing. And, as I said last year, I think we should wait for the experience that comes from the work of the climate bourgeoisie before deciding whether and, if so, how we should organise a possible citizen thing. So, as I said, we cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170355	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170359	However, the reason why we are resubmitting it has also been changed in the version we are discussing today is that when we discussed it last time, among other things. The rapporteur's party and the rapporteur have already said: there may be some interesting perspectives in this, but let us wait to hear what the experience is from the climate bourgeoisie. That is why we are now putting it forward. These experiences are beginning to come in now, and, as I have said, they are quite positive, quite as I am informed. That's why we thought that with this feedback from the climate bourgeois thing, it might be time for us to discuss a real citizen thing at Christiansborg. So what does the rapporteur think about this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170451	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170454	I think it is quite fine, by the way. I have noted that the wording of the proposal has been changed from the last time, and I really think that is wise. If you are quite determined on certain things in relation to how such a thing should be, then it may just be that it is becoming more difficult to achieve it fully in line with this. In fact, contrary to the questioner here, I do not necessarily have the impression that it is positive feedback that is in relation to how the climate bourgeoisie has worked. That is why I think it would be wrong to go in and start debating it now. So I think it is more important to have a completely sober account of how it has happened, rather than that it is such a bit at the rumour agency that we are discussing whether it is good or bad.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170545	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170548	Then, of course, I can try to take down what the rapporteur says positively: that social democracy will wait until there is a proper reporting from the climate bourgeoisie. That is how I hear the rapporteur and then you are open to discussion. It is not necessarily the case that we take a position, but that we wait until the experience is there. Okay, it may be that we do not have the experience of the climate bourgeois thing, but we have experience from a large number of other citizens' things about whether it is in Denmark, i.e. in the City of Copenhagen, or it is in Ireland or in East Belgium or in Germany or in Poland. My question is this: what does the rapporteur say about the experience we have to face?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170637	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170641	In fact, I am thinking that it may well make a great deal of sense in a municipality to reduce a citizen's thing or to do something about a very specific thing that needs to be done. But what we are talking about here is a consultative thing for the Folketing in relation to everything. It is, of course, well described in the proposal, where the intention is to ensure that there is a broad and representative sample of the population. I would certainly like to see the result of the climate bourgeoisie that has been before we take a position on it, and if we are forced to vote on this proposal now, we cannot support it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170730	There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the Social Democrat rapporteur. Then it is the rapporteur of the Left. Here you go, sir. Thomas Danielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329170742	Thank you for that, President. Sir. Uffe Elbæk is a trained social educator and journalist, and the Socialist rapporteur, Mr. Lennart Damsbo-Andersen is a trained carpenter. We also have some in here who have a Master's degree, we have one who excels in a Master's degree, Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær, and I believe that Mr. Jan Bjergskov Larsen is a trained teacher, and I have distinguished myself by becoming a truck mechanic and later taking a bank education. That is to say, we are the people who have put on the thing to represent them. It is quite, quite ordinary Danes with quite ordinary backgrounds. Therefore, we represent the Danes who have asked us to rule our people's rule, which is based on the principle that it is the ordinary Danes who come to Tinge. It is clear from the Constitution that no one is above or beside the Parliamentary Assembly for that. It will, of course, still be the case if you do a citizen's thing. Of course, we can discuss what competence a citizen's thing should have. It is likely that in a final model it will end up being a sort of sparring partner or an advisory body. After all, we politicians are already adopting legislation on the basis of consultation with and from citizens, NGOs, associations, interest groups and civilians. We'll do that before we make the decision in here. So there's an enormous amount of citizen involvement. As I have already said, there is already an opportunity to be heard, and the most obvious possibility, I would say, is to join a political party. I strongly recommend that. A citizen's thing is not contrary to citizen involvement, but we do not believe, and it is also from the experience we already have today with the Climate Citizen's thing, that this is a way to go. So the Left does not approve of an attempt to do an extended citizen thing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171016	Thank you. Sir. Uffe Elbæk for a brief comment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171021	Now it was a very nice, diverse professional list that was mentioned here a moment ago about what our professional background was, but is it not true that if we look at all 179 in here, there is an overweight of people who have higher education, while people who have a medium-term education are a minority and those who are unskilled are an extremely small minority in this Parliament? So the diversity that was just outlined before does not correspond to a diversity in the Folketing. And the whole idea of doing a citizen's thing or one of the ideas of doing a citizen's thing is to put together a group of citizens who actually correspond to the diversity that is out there in society and who can just have an advisory, inspiring role in relation to the rest of us who sit in here, so that with a slightly square image you can say that we are the board, while the citizen's thing is supposed to be an advisory board.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171128	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171130	Yes, there is a proportional greater representation of members of the Folketing who have some form of university education; that is correct. But if it is inappropriate, then it is the citizens who make inappropriate choices, because they are the ones who have once said who should represent them. And I have to admit, I don't actually see it as a problem in my day-to-day life. And I do not see it at all as a problem that can be replaced by a citizen's thing. You can choose 10,000 representative people by doing some funnel function, which then sprays out some people with all the different backgrounds in the world that more statistically accurately reflect the Danish population, and we have also tried to do so with our climate bourgeoisie, but the rapporteur should have almost been involved in the reports that have been there, because they clearly showed who is involved in the debate. They're retired civil engineers and so on. And maybe I'd like to elaborate on that in answer to your last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171244	Here you go, sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171248	Now I do not know how exactly to select the participants of the climate bourgeoisie, but I can at least say that when it comes to a normal citizen's thing, you get a representative sample of the population in terms of age, gender, social, economic etc., and that is the whole point of it. That is why I would like to ask the rapporteur about the experience we have gained, however, from the citizens of Denmark, in other words at local level, but also from the citizens of Ireland and Belgium, who have clearly helped to increase the public's interest in political decision-making processes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171329	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171331	In other words, what we chose in connection with the climate bourgeoisie which the rapporteur's party at the time helped to negotiate through our climate legislation was precisely this representative method of selection. And there has also been a justified criticism that the Folketing has actually not really backed up so much, which I think is quite real. I was prevented the second time because of a sick child. But I don't think we got value for money or rather value for money... sorry, President... and I don't think that's a way to go. I do not think that we have any challenges with people having an accessibility to us politicians. I experience an accessibility compared to us from high as low in our society with all the backgrounds of the world. Well, it's never been as easy to yell at us as it is today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171426	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. And then it is the rapporteur of the Socialist People's Party, Mr. Jan Bjergskov Larsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171444	Thank you very much. Thank you to the proposers for the proposal here, which suggests that before the end of this parliamentary year we should launch a three-year trial programme with a different way of implementing democracy. When you hear the debate here, it is as if there is too much thought that democracy is static, that it can only be done in the way it is done and that if we start to shake it or do something else, then we are shaking our democracy. We in the SF do not agree with that. In fact, it is intended that this citizen thing should contribute to information and public debate and the development of new ways of making politics, and the citizen thing should also have the opportunity to make some very concrete recommendations to the Folketing. I think this is a good and important proposal, and we in the SF are incredibly happy about it. We believe, as I have already said, that democracy is something we must continue to work for. And we could also be better at listening to what people think between the elections. We have talked before about how we are represented, and this citizen thing will be composed in a completely different way, including by some who are not experts. And there we simply have to be able to deal with the fact that we are giving them a certain amount of co-responsibility in terms of bidding in with some democratic decisions and the way in which we can solve the problems of the future. In fact, we think that the proposal contains a very fine balance. On the one hand, you try to do something new and inspiring, something engaging, something binding for the new people who come into this citizen thing, and possibly they become aware of what kind of difficult decision-making processes you can actually have, and they are also met with how you can balance it against each other. On the other hand, we are giving it and it is at least just as important that both Parliament and democracy what you can call new oxygen, in terms of being inspired to do things in a different way. However, it is beyond doubt that the rapporteur on the Left has now gone; it is a pity that it is still the Danish Parliament, because nothing has to be decided by the Danish Parliament, and in this way we do not compromise on the idea and principle that representative democracy continues to exist. We support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171730	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171733	I think that SF's advisor should go from being a substitute member to becoming a permanent member of the Folketing. I simply become so committed and think that there are so many good considerations on the part of the rapporteur. That's how long it's gonna be, isn't it? First of all, I want to say that I am really, really happy that SF can see itself in this and seriously relate to it and provides good input on it. I almost had such an aha experience along the way, because the rapporteur mentioned that we can learn more in the course of the parliamentary term, so that in this way this citizen thing is almost our all focus group in a rather figurative sense. The interesting thing is that some parties cultivate these focus groups very much in order to get knowledge from citizens into their political system. What is then the task of the bourgeois thing is to get the inspiration to benefit all of us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171844	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171848	I fully agree with the rapporteur's analyses.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171853	Then there are no more brief remarks to the SF rapporteur, so thank him. Then we have the rapporteur for the Radical Left, Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329171909	Thank you and also thank you for the good speeches. I heard them over here, where I was just disturbed, but I was there and I heard them. Now, of course, we have been debating the establishment of the Centre for the Development of Democracy, but that is closely in line with this proposal from Mr. Uffe Elbæk and I to create a citizen thing in Denmark, gather 100 randomly, but representatively selected citizens and allow to discuss different topics, set up some citizens' assemblies on topical issues that they find interesting, and then oblige the Folketing to discuss the recommendations that both citizens' assemblies and citizens' stuff come up with. As Mr. Uffe Elbæk has already mentioned, there are other countries that have very good experience of involving citizens more in the political process, and I think that the debate in the past was also marked by this curiosity, a reasonable openness to think new and a sincere desire broadly in the Folketing to give more priority to citizen involvement and democracy development in the political processes. So here's an attempt to try it out more concretely. After all, we have tried the Climate Citizen thing, and we have to build on it, but we have also taken into account the lessons of what did not work, in this proposal, because it was too non-committal. We need to experiment a little with the forms, even when we do not think it is in the closet, because if we do not try to involve more people, democracy will dry up, and when the world develops and other forums are debated, we must also try to break it up and involve it, otherwise what I think the Socialist rapporteur said in the previous debate will be these different bubbles where we do not meet each other. But funny enough, we also have Nordic neighbours who are ahead and have good experiences, and they also have some bad experiences, and we must also try to take them into account. Sometimes it may be good to be a little behind, it's not always, but now we can learn from the bad experiences they've experienced elsewhere where they've been ahead in this area. I don't want it to be a hoax. It is really the lesson here that such a thing, in which you put people in the eye and say, see, it is a fine little citizen thing here, must not be, and that is absolutely not the intention, and I think we have taken that into account. The Left rapporteur has gone for now and respect for picking up children and other things, and he said that it is easy to call out to us here in the Folketing, it is easy to get access, you can send an e-mail, you can put in a citizen's proposal if you can get 50,000 signatures, but that is not what this is all about, because it is not just a question of shouting someone out; it is also a question of getting into dialogue in such a situation where you have to get exactly what the Christian Democrats' rapporteur previously called a general view, that is to say what it is for some priorities, what it is for some consideration you have to take to get things going up. It is not only being able to shout a single case. This is quite important to me, because yes, democracy can be seen as heavy, bureaucratic, slow, but if you have it on your shoulders and have to help carry it forward, it is also undoubtedly the best way to solve the major problems of society. Just see what happens when it doesn't exist. So we must safeguard democracy, but we must also develop democracy, and that is what this proposal represents. We support, of course, and so does the Enhedslisten, from which I would like to say hello again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172301	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172304	Not surprisingly, I agree, because it is a joint proposal. I would just like to say from the Green Group that we were very pleased that Radicals agreed to this and, above all, helped to upgrade it. For some of what is new, compared to when we first put it forward, is, after all, a very clear anchoring and commitment in relation to the Folketing. I just want to give a cadeau for it. It was Radicale's very marked ambition that came through there. That was quite right. For how do we ensure that the Folketing will take seriously the recommendations that a given citizen thing comes to us with? And how do we ensure that it enters into the other committee work and the debates we have in this Chamber? So I was just really, really happy with that emphasis on that anchoring in the Assembly Hall.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172409	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172412	Thank you so much. And exactly anchoring in the committee work. Because how is it that we take this seriously individually in our rapporteur's area? It is also a work that is being done, including in the whole of the EU context, so how do you get into the decision-making process earlier? Because it is also about our European democracy. In the same way, we're trying to anchor this, so it's committing more. Of course, thank you for your recognition. I also very much appreciate the cooperation. And when we go into something in the Radical Left, we do it wholeheartedly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172455	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172459	In conclusion, I have a question which may be difficult to answer. But sometimes I am surprised that some of the countries with which we compare ourselves, by the way, are passing us by. There is Ireland, for example, which has done a great deal of national citizenship. This became extremely important both in relation to the issue of abortion, but also in relation to the possibility of getting married to someone of the same sex as you have, that is, partnership legislation. We also see it in Belgium, East Belgium. There they have institutionalized it and it is completely integrated in the way they understand parliamentarianism and representative democracy. Why are there such differences?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172550	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172553	That's very interesting. I have also philosophed about it, and I do not think I can give the final answer. A former rapporteur said that Danish democracy is better than its reputation. And yes, it is! Because that is really good, and we are far more solution-oriented in here than can be seen from the outside. It's a force. Then why should we pretend that we do not have the strength to try something new? After all, we are a strong democracy, which has just a surplus to be able to do something else. I also think that we are seeing it now, for example. the reception of refugees and other things. But it is not always that we, as a nation and as a democracy, behave as strong as we actually are. Because when you're strong and you have a good foundation, you have a surplus to try something new.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172638	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment from Mrs Mai Mercado.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172644	Thank you, and thank you for your speech. In fact, I just have a clear question, because the proposal states that the proposers do not want to propose a concrete model, but it nevertheless states that this citizen's thing should then select political issues that Members want to discuss and that the citizen's thing should have the opportunity to make concrete recommendations to the Folketing, and then I just hope that the rapporteur will be able to give an example of what those recommendations could be.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172709	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172712	It could have been that one had sat down and discussed how we get more solar cells on the roofs, on all public roofs. That is the kind of thing I know there is a whole group of citizens who are concerned about now. So it could be about whether it is something that the Folketing will be able to work on. It could also be that it was a much more abstract problem: how do you get into the process earlier in terms of regulating psychiatry? I could imagine a lot of different things that this citizen thing might be interested in.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172747	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172751	It is more just to understand the difference between this and the citizens' proposals, because both of the two examples that the rapporteur has just mentioned could just be formulated by putting the pen on paper and making them as a citizen's proposal, and then you don't just have a few hundred • how many people now have to be in this citizen's thing • selected to formulate a proposal or some recommendations, but then you have 50,000 to formulate a given proposal. So can the rapporteur understand that it may be a little difficult to distinguish between what a citizen's thing should be able to do, which the citizens' proposals cannot do today?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172823	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172824	They must be able to complement each other. For a citizen's proposal is an attempt to get us to discuss issues that we may not get taken up by ourselves. At any rate, that is what I remember the rapporteur of the rapporteur's party at the time. These may be a little more ethical issues which we may not be able to address, and which we will at least have a discussion of here in the Danish Parliament. After all, a citizen's thing gets the discussion among a group of citizens where, and that is what I referred to at the beginning of my speech, not only can you shout out a member of parliament or a group of members of parliament, but you can have the discussion about how we should prioritise something or other in relation to other things and how it can actually be solved financially or in other ways.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172913	There are no more brief comments, so I would like to thank the rapporteur. I would also like to welcome Mrs Mai Mercado from the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329172933	Thank you, President. Today, we are debating a motion for a resolution on the creation of a citizens' Europe in a three-year trial programme, which is at least intended to provide specific tasks for politicians. It is also a partial re-submission, and last time we rejected it nicely, and we will do so again. Several others have mentioned from the platform some of the activities and mechanisms that we already have today, both ensuring and helping to raise the democratic conversation between citizens and politicians, and thus also helping to create a shorter distance between citizens and politicians. One example may be the tradition we have for public meetings that help to strengthen democratic dialogue, and that is everything from the very big meeting of the people at Bornholm, Djøf-stortion, as it is also called, to these theme folk meetings, which are blooming in the country, and which are from nature to food's popular meetings, and you also have folk meetings with a geographical theme. I myself have attended the Funen People's Meeting a number of times. Then there are also school elections in the municipalities. There is also a day of democracy at Christiansborg. And we have every year school classes that come in here and that we give tours. I think that many schools may think that it can be difficult to get an education, but I think it must be one of the easiest, because there is always a member of parliament who will readily take in school classes and want to show them around. And if you can't do it yourself, you can always find a colleague slashing competitor from your big circle who is willing to show around. There is also citizenship day, where we also open the doors to new citizens and show the parties, the cultural night could be mentioned, and there are a lot of other good things that are happening locally. After all, we also have the citizens' proposal system in which 50 000 citizens can jointly submit a proposal directly to the Parliamentary Assembly. It is, in a sense, a citizen's thing, but in a fluid and perhaps not quite so bureaucratic form. It is certainly relatively easy. This proposal should then allow a citizen's thing to make political recommendations. Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen mentioned just now that it could, for example, be a model for solar cells on the roof, it could be the fundamental challenges of psychiatry, where I then asked the heretical question: But can the citizens' proposals not already do that today? It is actually just to say that we are basically happy that we can actually do that today. For Conservatives, it was important for us to have the citizens' proposal system. The fact that one can make one's voice heard and that only 50,000 support is needed in order to actually get a proposal directly in the Chamber is really, really good, and we are pleased about that. We supported the citizens' proposal scheme from the outset. We think it's important. We also think it is healthy that it does not require more than these 50 000 supporters before a proposal comes directly to the Parliamentary Assembly. And, of course, we are happy to discuss how we can involve the citizens even more. In the previous debate there was such a spirit of hey, should we not have a discussion in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure? We are also very happy to do so with this, although it is not just because there is no funding in this proposal that we are going to support it now and here. However, the discussion and the work of involving and ensuring that citizens are involved, we are happy to take heart.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173314	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173319	First of all, it is nice that there is the message from Conservatives. That's very good. The reason I stand up is because there is a distinct difference between citizens' proposals.dk and citizens' things. I'm about someone who likes citizens' suggestions.dk. There's something very special about that. You can gather a lot of people around your own idea, and then you get the opportunity to present it to us. But a citizen's thing has a completely different intention and also a dynamic one, because the citizen's thing consists of, let us say, 100 elected, representatively elected members who do not sit there because of a party relationship. What is the ambition is that, with the diversity and the perspectives of this group, they agree in consensus to recommend a particular solution or more solutions to a given problem. The examples we have seen abroad are, of course, that we have taken up some very conflicting thematics, which we should then try to find a consensus around, and that is where the strength lies: if that group of people can agree on a solution to something that is really difficult, then perhaps it could give us inspiration in this Chamber.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173441	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173445	Yes, although it may also seem difficult that the 100, 200, or how many of them may be, people who, after all, are probably very different, even very different in their political position, could find common solutions. However, I do believe that the citizens' proposal system helps us to deal politically with some of the difficult debates as well. For example, if not every year, so close, we have a citizens' proposal on circumcision. It is not certain that we would have that proposal if we did not have a citizens' proposal system. So in this way I really think that there is already the possibility in the citizens' proposal that we can draw in some thematics that otherwise we would not discuss politically, because it might be a little sore.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173540	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173544	I fully agree with the latter, i.e. that citizens' proposals are helping to poke into some debates that we might not have touched by ourselves, such as the circumcision of boys' children. That is such a very, very concrete example. But back to the citizen thing: what we saw in Ireland, where the whole issue of abortion was dealt with in a very, very Catholic country, ended up with the legalisation of abortion. The reason was, of course, that you had this citizenship thing, and it had changed people's perception of how things are connected. So one thing is that we can be inspired in here, for example by citizens' suggestions.dk; another thing is that the citizen's thing simply also helps to raise both the understanding and the discussion within the population.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173637	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173642	Well, there wasn't really a real question, but I just want to sign for my mind. Without wishing to put our hands on the hot plate, we do not have the habit of using it when there is no funding; when you present your draft budget, that is what you are aiming for, I would say that we are happy to continue the discussion, and I think it makes good sense to take it in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, where we already have a number of other discussions. For example, we have discussions in relation to the Committee on Research, where we have the discussion, whether we have found the right model. So, do we actually have a model that is functional and works, and what do they look like in the other Nordic parliaments, and is there something that can be inspired by? So the discussion is alive, and it should remain so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173730	Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen from the Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173733	Thank you. I think that is a very good thing, including what the difference is, because it is something quite different from a citizen's proposal where you can get a case in. But this is about just meeting. As the rapporteur said, we can have different political backgrounds and positions, yes, it is also the idea, that is to say, to represent something different and to agree on a challenge. It could also be how we reach the 70 percent target or how we reach 80%. And, of course, there must be a professional basis for it. When we do not have the funding, it is because it is here under the auspices of the Danish Parliament, as with the Climate Citizen thing, that is also financed from it. So we must be able to resolve this if we sit together in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. But I would like to hear most of the reflections on the fact that people are actually being put to the same priority, in other words what the rapporteur thinks it could promise, or whether it is going to be possible to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173829	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173833	Without reaching where it is that we are voting in favour of the proposal, I would just like to say that it can, of course. And you often see it when, for example, a government holds a summit, where it is that different stakeholders are brought together around a given problem or challenge; then it is precisely to get the different views. So there is certainly something that can be done, and one can be more inspired by that. It might be interesting to see, precisely because we have the discussions on the Committee on Research, whether we could, in this context, create a way of examining and controlling the government, which we now have a task to do, where we can be inspired by other ways of doing so from the Nordic countries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173920	Thank you very much to Mrs Mai Mercado. There are no more brief comments. I'd like to welcome Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329173946	Thank you. After all, this proposal is about setting up an experimental system with a citizen's thing in the Folketing, a citizen's thing which must consist of volunteers and randomly selected citizens, i.e. a representative sample of the population. I feel a bit like I think that we already have Denmark's biggest citizen thing, that is to say all the Danes out there who elect us to the Parliamentary Assembly members who represent the citizens who voted for them. And I think: is it not better to choose people directly, so that you are represented by the people you think are similar to you, so that you have the right attitudes, compared to what you think, than that you are represented by someone who has been randomly appointed? I certainly prefer to choose directly who it should be, instead of pointing to people for a citizen's thing, from how old they are, or what salary they have, or social conditions or other things. It's not certain it's gonna hit right. I also call on the general election to ensure that people do not vote for me because of my age. You have to vote for me because of my opinions. You don't have to vote for anyone because it's a young man or because it's an old man or because it's a woman or it's a man. You have to vote for those with whom you share opinions. We share our views; we do not share our economic situation or our level of education. So I don't know exactly what it is you want to do in relation to doing a citizen's thing. Are we getting something more representative than what we have today, where it is the citizens who choose the members of parliament on the basis of opinions? Isn't that very good? Furthermore, the proposal further states that a citizen's thing should contribute to information, public debate and the development of new policies, and the citizen's thing should be given the opportunity to make concrete recommendations to the Folketing, and the citizen's thing model must contain a certain obligation for politicians and the Folketing. That's more what I feel about the fact that there's a commitment in it. After all, we Members of Parliament are only obliged to our own consciences. We are not even obliged to do what the parties say. Well, we stand as individuals in the Assembly Hall and have to vote as individualists. There is nothing binding on us, so I do not quite know whether it is at all within the framework of the constitution to say that we must now be committed by a citizen's thing. We are not obliged by the parties, so if I may say so, I am not quite sure whether the wording contained in this motion for a resolution goes in relation to, among other things. The Constitution. I would also like to say that I actually think that we should be careful not to talk ourselves down as Members of Parliament. Actually, I think we're incredibly accessible. People can call us, they can write us. I don't know if everyone is doing it, but I think we're all getting daily calls from organisations that have good ideas and suggestions and things we can do, and also from individual citizens. As recently as today, a citizen has called me about the recovery of tax debts. In addition to the fact that he had had some problems with the case-handling process that is fair, so he did not suggest that we should clear all debts that were in the old IT system. That's 100 billion. kr. I listened to him, but unfortunately I had to disappoint him and say that it was perhaps not the best idea to iron 100 billion. kr. of the board. But he had a good dialogue with me, and at least we had a good conversation. Last week it was a middle-aged man about my own age who was tired of being stopped by the police all the time because they thought he was a crazy driver because he had a car that could look like such a little muscle car. But as he said, I'm an old man, I'm not the one who's running a race out there. So he thought it was discriminatory that he was stopped all the time. So I had a chat with him in the morning. I just checked my phone 18 minutes ago. That, of course, is a short time. But I actually think we're available as members of parliament. We've got the biggest citizen thing out there. The Danes can contact us. Then there may be a discussion about whether people do not know that they can just send an e-mail or write or come into a committee and talk to all the rapporteurs. In fact, I think there are many who do not know how easy it is to get in and get in touch with our representatives in here. At least I think we have a great deal of responsibility and people take it on themselves, I have the impression that we are actually meeting with those who want to meet with us. In fact, I personally do a great deal to meet with those with whom I disagree more than those with whom I agree. I often experience that I might write a letter, and then I get a request from an organization that says: Dennis, we agree completely with your speech, shouldn't we meet about it? I might actually say no, because if we agree, maybe that's not where I'm going to spend the time. On the other hand, if I meet people who disagree with me, I actually think I have an obligation to learn more about what they have of opinions. Now I am the tax rapporteur, as I mentioned earlier, so I meet, for example. with the border shop Fleggaard, that is, the organisation behind it, although I come from a party which is very much in favour of bringing down the border trade, in other words eliminating the charges that give them a competitive advantage. I think it is an obligation that we have to meet with those with whom we disagree. So I don't think there's this screaming need for us to have a citizen thing. Actually, I think we're available to people. Then it may well be that people are not aware of how easy it is and that we actually have publicly available telephone numbers. My address is publicly available on the Danish Parliament's website; you can just send a letter. In fact, I've also experienced people calling at my door asking if they can talk to me. I would say that may be a little cross-border sometimes when they get so close. But we're available. So I don't really need this much. One last point I would like to mention, and which I also mentioned in the last resolution, is that we are actually working on an investigation of power, which is this testing of democracy. So maybe in this case we should wait and see what the result will be before we get all sorts of things started. At any rate, I think it is exciting to see the investigation of power which is close to being started, and I think we should have some results from it before we start new attempts as such as a citizen thing. So I think we actually have a huge citizen thing. Let us then hold on to it and then just point out how accessible we actually are and how easy it is to get in touch with members of parliament.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174514	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mr. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174518	I have no doubt that a given citizen can get in touch with the rapporteur very easily. Most of us get lots and lots of inquiries, and most of us also respond properly to them, and I do so personally. But that's not the idea of the citizen thing... that it should be easier for us. That, among other things. is the idea of the bourgeois thing... there are many good things about a citizen thing......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... The rapporteur also knows that we have discussed several times in the debate today why so few people want to be members of a political party. Well, we're under 4%. Today, who wants to be a member of a political party. What about the other 96 percent?? How can we engage them, and how can we strengthen their political commitment and support for political discussions? That's one of them. What is at the heart of the bourgeois thing. So what does the rapporteur think about the fact that the focus is actually not on us? The focus is on the citizens, and perhaps the citizens can actually come up with better ideas than the ones we get in this Chamber.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174644	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174648	I fully understand the purpose of what you want to go to. But I also think you give somebody a false hope. I mean, if you do a citizen thing with 100 people, or it could be 200, you give them a greater commitment, of course, but what about the rest? I think you need to talk more into another model. Today there are people who become members of the Danish Nature Conservation Association and then in this way influence politicians, because they also report in with consultation answers and contact us and have consultations and all sorts of things with us in here. Some join Agriculture & Food and influence policy along these lines and provide input for us. Some just come as individuals. I mean, if someone comes and convinces Mr. Simpson... Uffe Elbæk on a good idea, it doesn't take any more people to do it. Then it can enter the Assembly Hall. So there are so many ways and ways to influence. So I think it will be a little misleading if you think that because we appoint perhaps 100 people or 200 people for a citizen's thing, there is a huge commitment. Yeah, that's for the 100 or 200, but what about the rest? Why not motivate people to be active in all sorts of community life, in civil life out there, to join a party or make citizens' proposals, to attend public meetings. After all, there are a lot of good ways to influence us, and so do people, fortunately.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174754	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174757	I just want to sit here for a long time and discuss this with the rapporteur, but we only have 30 seconds, so it will be in headlines. But what is special about a citizen's thing is, firstly, that people are not party representatives; secondly, that they reflect the diversity of society, and thus also have very different views on a given issue, and that their task is to reach a consensus. It is, of course, a long way from the dynamics that the rapporteur knows from this Chamber and also from our own parties. That is why we also see from the experience of citizens' things around the world that citizens actually have a higher level of ambition than their elected politicians. Something happens when you actually have to find a consensus decision across opinions, and that is just another dynamic. Can the rapporteur see a value in this dynamic and can it possibly inspire the work we have in this Chamber?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174859	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329174903	I agree that you could take a lot of rounds on this, but sometimes it gets a little limited, so at least you have to take extra rounds up on the platform, and it could be exciting too. But I do not agree with the premise. It is, of course, in the fact that people are then divided up in relation to gender, age, education, social conditions and perhaps also economic conditions, and I think that we should divide up according to our views. I have no problem voting for 18-year-olds if they are the ones who have the best positions; I have no problem voting for 75-year-olds if they are the ones who have the best positions. But I would be sorry if people would only vote for me because I have the right education or the right age or gender. So why should you be better represented in a citizen's thing because you have just chosen an 18-year-old or a 75-year-old or a mechanic or a farmer? It's all about attitudes. And if we look at our Parliament today or at the parties, people have split up according to opinion, and that is how it should be in our democracy. So I'm not happy with the way we split people up according to all sorts of criteria. I do not think that a more representative consultative body, as such a citizen thing will then be. So I'm not quite in on it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175000	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175004	It's super interesting and now we can at least take one more round because it's not a substitute for the Folketing or an extra Parliament. We are here to represent opinions and to share our views. I think we can agree entirely on that. And what we represent and for which we are elected is what this floor stands for. However, will the rapporteur not reflect a little further on the fact that a citizen's thing should be able to do something else, namely to bring people together to agree on something, to discuss for and against and what dilemmas there may be in it, and not just to say that now we in the Folketing have to resolve what is actually agreed on how it could be done. And that is why it is a supplement to the citizens' proposals that we have also discussed, which are precisely: we would like you to discuss a particular subject on which we are concerned. But here we have to deal with the dilemmas, the priorities, that sort of thing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175108	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175111	I understand where you are going with that, but I think, as I also mentioned in my speech, that we have Well, we all see that they actually come with something where there is consensus. Sometimes the Danish Industry may come together with the trade union movement and say: we have reached a compromise; that is what we are putting forward. And then we typically listen more because they actually bring us something on the table. And that is how it is across many organizations where we are sometimes surprised: God, they can agree on something! And sometimes they can. Often they disagree completely, and then we have to take a position. However, I do not actually see it as a huge need that we have to do a citizen thing with 100 people, when we have one with several million who actually come forward with proposals, often also worked through proposals where they make compromises internally. So, we have media negotiations now, when the Danish Media, which is their professional organisation, has actually made a compromise across all newspapers, even though they have very different interests • whether it is a very small medium or a very large media, or whether they are under one scheme or the other, they have actually made a compromise where they come and say: look, we actually want this to happen. Did we need a citizen thing that would then come up with a proposal on media policy? No, I don't think that would have made it any better. Actually, I think what we have today works okay.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175215	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175218	I agree that the entire organisation of the parties is a fantastic example of consensus democracy and what we can do, and what also makes us strong as a society and also other elements of it. Now the rapporteur himself opened up the debate in relation to the investigation of power and what I hope will be an ad hoc committee set up there. Could we not also try to have a debate on how to continuously involve citizens in a form or hybrid, as the rapporteur also mentioned in the previous debate, so that we might get some of what we can agree on could be interesting here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175259	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175302	Yes, I am quite open that we need to involve the citizens as much as possible, but a real citizen thing I do not think is the way forward. In other words, I do not see anyone in here saying that we should not involve the citizens. It is probably not one of the most popular views to come out with. So there is no fundamental disagreement, because of course we must involve people. I just don't think it's the best way to divide people up by sex, age, income and social conditions, and something like that, where you say it's these 100 people who have to advise us. Why couldn't it just as well be a thousand other people from Holstebro or anywhere else across the country? Or maybe it could only be young people across political divides? There, too, we see that the youth parties get together sometimes. Actually, I think it's working well enough today. Well, I don't need to be 100 people or 200 people, or whatever it is I don't have.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175343	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. We shall now turn to the rapporteur for the authors of the motion for a resolution, and that is Mr von der Vring's report. Uffe Elbæk of the Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329175403	Thank you for that and also thank you for the debate we have had. I could well imagine many of our other colleagues taking these very fundamental discussions on how we see things, not least our own place of work, and what we are now in the world for, namely making wise, democratic decisions. So I can say on my behalf, at least, that I have been very pleased with the debate we have had, including about citizens' issues. I would like to make a few points about citizens' things, because I can hear that there is still some uncertainty about what such a size can do and what kind of framework and principles it works in. Firstly, it is important to make it clear that it should not replace the Folketing and thus the representative democracy. In the previous debate I spoke a little about companies that have a development department, and if you are going to use this picture too, you can say that we are the board, it is we who make the decisions in this Chamber, where the citizen thing is what you would call an advisory board, which comes with a different perspective on a given issue and says: we would like to recommend that you take this very seriously. That is also what is new in the proposal now before us, namely that it is emphasised how much it is anchored in the Folketing. And then there may be a point on the part of the rapporteur from the Danish People's Party in whether one can say that one is committed to it, i.e. whether the wording is appropriate to use in relation to the constitution and something like that. And there I have to say, the finer details I don't know. What is involved, however, is that, as Members of Parliament, we take seriously the recommendations that come, consider them and think well when there is a recommendation from a citizen's thing. Then there were also comments from the rapporteur for the Danish People's Party on the 100 people that we have proposed might be a size that a citizen's thing could contain. It has to be said that it has almost been taken directly from the citizens' thing in Ireland and France, which has also used citizens' stuff. It is not a permanent citizen's thing that is continuous change, and that is to say that every year and a half you could imagine a new team coming in, and what differs significantly from citizens' proposals.dk. is that over a long period of time you are working on a self-chosen thematics, and thus the result is that the participants in these citizen's things also understand how deeply conflict and dilemma our work here in Parliament sometimes is, so that there are many things to consider when you have to make a final decision. So it is in principle also a training course for the representatives who sit in the citizen's house. Then what comes out of a citizen thing like that? As I said, there are examples from here: The City of Copenhagen has used it in connection with the transport planning of the inner city, and right now they have set up a citizen's thing in relation to a very conflicting case in Copenhagen, namely Lynetteholmen; Albertslund Municipality is planning to do a firm citizen's thing. So that way there are examples. I also believe that the Radical Left, as a party, has set up its own citizenship, so the parties have also begun to use the working method itself. But in the world we will also see examples of this, and I just mentioned France briefly, and it was Macron who reduced it in relation to all the issues. If we are to deal with climate challenges, then what does that mean in relation to social conflicts in society? Ireland has been working on a very, very sensitive issue for them, such as the issue of abortion, and it was very sensitive in that Ireland is a Catholic country, yet the citizen's thing came up with a solution which was approved and accepted by the Irish Parliament. When you look at all these research reports and evaluations that are coming, there are some things they conclude about the citizen thing and what the value of it is. Now I'm reading it specifically. Firstly, the citizens' issues that have been looked at create political participation without party political membership. There are very many people who are not members of parties, but because they were given the experience of entering into such a context, it created political participation. It creates confidence in citizens without pandering to populism, was also a product of it. It increases citizens' confidence in the political institutions, increases citizens' knowledge of political issues, increases citizens' involvement and improves the quality of solutions and legislation. It is all something that is left from the citizens' things that have been settled. I can hear that there is support from the SF, support from the Enhedslisten, from the Radicals, the Free Greens, and that is wonderful, but we need more on board, not, and that is why I just hope that this discussion will not end here, because I think that citizens' things are something that has come to stay. Unfortunately, the representative of the Left is not in the Chamber now, but the rapporteur on the Left said that he did not have an experience that there was good experience from the Climate Citizen thing. Now I just had time to check up on a number of articles, including: from Svidenskab.dk, where they clearly said that this should in fact be held on to and rolled out as a working method and a democratic way of organizing itself, also in the municipalities around the climate issue. So, of course, there are both good and bad experiences from the Climate Citizen thing, but primarily it is only good experiences. So on behalf of those of us who want to, and we all want to, stand up for our democratic institutions, but at the same time also develop them, I would say that I sincerely believe that citizens' things have come to stay. Then it may not be decided today or tomorrow, but then I am pretty sure it will be the day after tomorrow. Those were supposed to be my final comments.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180115	That is not quite finished, because there is a brief comment from Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180120	I just want to agree that we are continuing our work. But now the rapporteur himself mentioned the municipalities, and perhaps we should have called this something much more boring, because in the municipalities they have 17 paragraphs. Four committees, and it is, of course, municipal citizenship that Social Democrats, Conservatives and Left Mayors are quite happy and have taken on board over the last two parliamentary term and are really cultivating. Here you invite citizens of the municipality to come in to discuss a number of issues over a year or half a year sometimes more and set up a section 17 paragraph. Four committees. So if we present it in this way, it could be that it could find more support around here, because the municipalities are actually here in front of the Danish Parliament again in relation to a number of specific things. I think it might be one of the ways we could work on it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180217	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180217-2	It's very enticing. We just have to call it something really, really boring, and then it goes through here in the Assembly Hall. I hope it's not that simple, but I understand the point. And I actually think that there was another point, namely that when I sometimes look out in the municipalities, I just see both a curiosity and a risk to grasp some of these issues in a completely different way than we do in this Parliament. So again: So that we don't think we're world champions in everything, it's just very good to look out and see what others do. And then, of course, we can get back to our discussion just before about a centre for democracy development. We need to get in knowledge and new knowledge, and we need to be inspired, and then we should never think that what we are doing now is the best of the best, because we can always do better.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180316	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180316-2	In fact, you can also get the inspiration right outside the front door. Then we must also see if we can do it, if we can cut it in a different way, so that more people can see themselves in it. In any case, it will be the call for us to go ahead with it as well.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180335	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180336	Exactly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180340	There was agreement. No one else wishes to speak, and that is why the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180416	As you know, there is no minister in this area. It is Parliament's own responsibility. I will listen carefully to the debate on the proposal, which is of course to be discussed in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. And I would say to the listeners that when someone comes to say UFO, that means the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. The debate is open. The first rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Lennart Damsbo-Andersen, Social Democracy. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180440	Thank you for that, President. It may well be a very quick debate, this one. There are indeed very many parties represented in this Chamber. After all, we have just dealt with two motions for resolutions which, individually, are aimed at achieving better citizen involvement and participation in the democratic process. Now we can deal with a legislative proposal which deals with the possibility for citizens to put the agenda in the Folketing. The possibility to make citizens' proposals was put into operation in January 2018. Since then, more than a thousand proposals have been put forward to apply for approval, and this shows that there is an incredibly great desire to put an agenda here in the Folketing. To date, we have received 33 proposals that have obtained 50,000 or more signatures 8 are under consideration, 20 have been rejected and 5 have been adopted. The five proposals concern Danish Climate Law now, mourning leave when a child is lost, maintaining the cancer treatment of children in four locations, quick and proper help for families with infant death and the introduction of birthrights. All of them are cases that deal with deeply serious issues and problems. In fact, we were supposed to have had this debate a year ago... or something that looks like, at least... but the corona ended that. But we have then spent that time in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure in a good and in-depth debate on how we can make the temporary arrangement permanent and what measures can be taken to improve the system. That is why the draft law also contains a number of technical approaches and a few more substantive changes. The experience of the debates that have taken place on citizens' proposals and the subsequent vote in the Chamber have shown that, although there may be a broad consensus on the content of a proposal, the very wording or wording of each proposal may well be of a nature that would allow it to be voted down in this Chamber. Technically, it is possible to table amendments to a citizens' proposal, but it would not really harmonize with the spirit of the law on citizens' proposals, nor would it be to show respect for the citizen's proposal. Therefore, it makes very good sense that questions can be put to the relevant minister in future before the first reading and that there will be an opportunity to make a report in committee so that it can be shown that there is a majority in favour of the proposal and that the proposal must be continued without having to vote in the Chamber at the risk of it being voted down. In the Social Democratic Party we are very pleased with the changes and improvements that are now being proposed in the new law on citizens' proposals. And we support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180734	Thank you, sir. Lennart Damsbo-Andersen. There are no brief comments, so I would like to welcome Mr. Jan Bjergskov Larsen from the Socialist People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180747	Thank you very much. We have just heard the rapporteur for the Social Democratic Party list how many citizens' proposals have actually been made and how many have been implemented and dealt with, and this shows that we in Denmark have adopted the citizens' proposals and that they actually also contribute to increasing the democratic development of our work. The Committee on the Rules of Procedure has considered whether it is possible to meet the challenges posed by citizens' proposals. After all, they vary quite considerably in relation to precision, to what is desired changed, to how they can be implemented, and to what consequences they can have. That's the way it is with citizens' suggestions. It is also difficult to establish real quality requirements for citizens' proposals. These may be legal or economic impact assessments without any citizens who have made the proposals having limited their ability to use the scheme or in order to be able to express some aspects of society that they want to focus on by the Folketing. At the same time, we should not be blind to the fact that a quality assessment can easily be seen as wanting to make a political impact on the proposal and that such a requirement would, to some extent, put the parliamentary administration in an inappropriate role. The Committee on the Rules of Procedure has proposed some amendments, and I would just like to say that, on the part of the SF, we think that these are some good improvements and tightening up on a very good regime we have in relation to citizens' proposals and we can fully support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180928	There is a brief comment from Mrs Mai Mercado. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180929	Thank you. That is actually a comment and not so much a question. It is actually just to express my thanks, because it was actually SF, which was the first party in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to say: listen, we should not take and qualify this citizens' proposal scheme so that it gets better! So it is really just a thank you from here, and also thanks for the excellent cooperation along the way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180953	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329180954	Well, then, we can correct the other way of thanking you in that you have actually listened to the proposal. It may well be that we were the first to raise it, but I think that there are many of us in here who have actually felt this way about the citizens' proposals, which we sometimes felt that for other reasons we were not content, but for other reasons we had to have reservations about or in other situations directly had to vote against, that this was not how a citizen's proposal was treated worthy of consideration. So together we have wanted that when people actually spend time and effort making a citizen's proposal, it has been important for us to be able to say that then it must also be treated with a certain degree of dignity.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181041	Then there are no more brief remarks to Mr. Jan Bjergskov Larsen. That is why we move on to Mr. Peder Hvelplund from Enhedslisten • De Red-Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181101	Although changes in the terms of office in this Parliament are sometimes rapid, we must get used to talking here today after the SF, but that has nothing to do with who is present in the Chamber. We also support the proposal that is before us. I think it is fantastic that the whole idea of citizens' proposals has absolutely been an enlargement and an enrichment is our democracy, namely that citizens will be able to make proposals directly in here. That is why I am also pleased that what started as an experimental scheme is now also being made permanent and that this proposal will subsequently ensure that we have an ongoing review of the scheme so that we can adapt it. For it is also an expression of some of the beauty of a democracy, namely that it is constantly dynamic and constantly evolving. There is nothing stationary, even if we adopt such a proposal as this, because it is clear that there must also be the possibility of being able to organise it on an ongoing basis. This is also the case with the proposal here. Some adjustments have been made to the original model, and I think that there are some positive things in it ■ precisely the possibility of being able to make a report and have qualified the proposals that are being made. It is also just to point out that there has also been a dilemma in it, because it is clear that when citizens collect signatures and have a citizens' proposal raised, it is also with a clear expectation that this is something that is being decided in the Parliamentary Chamber, that is to say that it is both being dealt with, but that it will also be voted on afterwards. I do not think it has been quite easy to say whether we should introduce this option, because it might also be feared that every time there was a citizen's proposal that it seemed a little uncomfortable to have to take a position on, or where it might be unpleasant to have to vote 'no' in the end, because you will not vote 'yes' anyway, you could simply adopt a report and have it shot to the corner. I am quite satisfied with the model that has been chosen here, where it is also clearly intended that a report should be submitted and that the proposal should be put to the vote, but that in those cases where we can adopt something that is politically forward-looking, in other words where we are, as we are committed to, something that needs to be worked on politically, there is the possibility of making a report. Because there may sometimes be things in a citizen's proposal that mean that you cannot just vote for it because it can be about funding or about some concrete challenges with the design. It makes sense that we now have the opportunity, through a joint report, to ensure that this becomes something, even if it is not adopted. And I think, as the Socialist rapporteur mentioned earlier, that it is very positive that we have been able to see that some of the citizens' proposals that have been tabled have actually led to changes in legislation. That is why we are going to support the proposal here. On the whole, we will continue to support the system of citizens' proposals, which is because it shows that democracy is dynamic and that we also have the possibility of constantly expanding democracy and democratic rights for citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181416	Thank you. There are no brief remarks to Mr. Peder Hvelplund, so we go to Mrs Mai Mercado from the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181431	I shall start by giving a greeting from the Left, which also supports the bill. And then I will also sign for the great work that has been done in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure with this bill. In this way, we have been through a longer process in which we have allowed ourselves for several weeks and months to reflect on, discuss and debate how to improve our citizens' proposal system, and I think that what we have come up with is a strengthening of the citizens' proposal system and helps to qualify the system. There is, on the one hand, the possibility of giving clarification before it goes to the Chamber for a first reading. It is quite fine and, on the other hand, there is the possibility of tabling amendments which could also qualify, for example, a slightly ambiguously formulated citizen's proposal; and, on the other hand, there is the possibility of making a report without the citizen's proposal being put to the vote. In fact, I very much agree with what Mr. Enhedslisten said. Peder Hvelplund has just mentioned that somewhere one might well fear that it might mean that one could pull some force out of some of the somewhat delicate debates. On the other hand, it is also important to say here from Parliament's platform that it will still be a majority in the Folketing who will have to deliver votes to such a report. And I actually see that the possibilities are greater than the dangers, namely the possibility that a report can impose an action on a minister, that a group of experts can be set up, that the Minister can be called for negotiations in the ministry, so that the citizens' proposals are actually directly followed up, and that it is not just a matter of voting red and yellow or green on the buttons. So I really expect a great deal from the review that we have here and from the improvement that we have here, and I think that we will come out with a better citizens' proposal system in the end.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181630	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so welcome to Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181644	Thank you. I shall be brief and say that the Danish People's Party can support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181651	Then the President cannot even sit down until the rapporteur has finished. And then we've reached Mr. Uffe Elbæk of the Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329181655	I would also like to say just as briefly as the rapporteur for the Danish People's Party, namely that I fully agree with the draft law. Nevertheless, I would like to make a few comments on this. There are some of us who have really been sitting for many hours down here and really wanted to spend a lot of gunpowder discussing the experiences with citizenssproposed.dk, and I have been following citizenssproposed.dk from the very beginning. And this is also an example of how an idea was initially rejected, and then you put it again, and then it gets a little edgy, and the third time is so lucky, and then we have got citizens' proposals.dk. And at first there were definitely more of our colleagues in here who didn't think it was their cup of tea. But today I think most people feel that it has come to stay. In other words, it has become a democratic tool that allows us to have some discussions in this Chamber inspired by what sort of discussions are going on in the rest of society. Sometimes, when I have been interviewed by journalists, they have said: well, is it a success that so many people send in citizens' proposals, and then there is a smaller number coming down to the Chamber and how many are actually adopted? When I look at it, there are many positive side consequences for citizens' proposals.dk, because you can't just read it out if they are adopted down here in the Chamber. A good example is the proposal for the education ceiling, which was initially rejected by a political majority. Then a year passed and the discussion had settled anyway, and the Social Democratic Party changed its attitude to the educational ceiling. So it was something that started among the students at the educational institutions. They made a citizens' proposal, initially it was rejected by a majority in here, but then a year later it actually ends up with a new piece of legislation. This is one of the things we can see out of citizens' proposals.dk. Something else is what it does to us in the party groups. The rapporteur for the Conservatives mentioned that there were sometimes some issues that we might not have addressed or discussed if citizens' proposals had not existed. One of them, for example, was: genital mutilation of male children. This certainly gave rise to a tremendous discussion within our own party group, and we had to bring in experts who were for and against. That is to say, what many outside the Folketing do not see for good reasons is what the ideas and proposals on citizens' proposals do in relation to an important political discussion within the party groups. So it helps to lighten our political debate both in this Chamber and in the groups as well. So I am simply so happy that we have had citizens' proposals.dk, and I am completely in favour of the amendments proposed in the draft law it was difficult to say, it is now late in the day. But we're backing up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182023	Thank you, sir. Uffe Elbæk. No one else has asked for the floor. The debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182056	The negotiations have been opened and the first to speak is the tax minister. Welcome to the tax minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182114	Thank you. With this motion for a resolution, the Left wishes to make self-serving institutions for the elderly, disabled and vulnerable, as well as non-profit associations in the cultural and sports fields tax-free. The proposal is based on the wish to eliminate the risk that many associations which otherwise operate in good faith will break the law by not paying tax on business income. At the same time, the tax exemption should help the association retain more revenue to pursue the association's non-profit purpose. It is, of course, a sympathetic proposal. Denmark is a country characterised by countless voluntary associations which are largely engaged in work for the benefit of many members and also for society in general. That is why, as a starting point, the government is also in favour of proposals that make it easier to run voluntary associations and self-serving institutions. However, we must be careful that, when we support society, we do so in the right way and that we support the right associations. There is a diversity of associations, and we are pleased about this, because this diversity covers precisely different types of associations. Some are small and locally anchored, some are large and nationwide with a professional aspect, some have purposes that accommodate relatively few members, while others have broader purposes of a more general nature. That is why we need tax rules that cover the associations widely. The associations should not be burdened with unnecessary paperwork, but we should not blindly support associations at the expense of other groups or other purposes. It is a balance and I think there are, in fact, good arguments for the rules that we have today. Non-profit associations already have good opportunities to avoid tax payments to the extent that income is used for non-profit purposes. In addition, according to the rules in force, associations are tax-free from income from non-business activities, e.g.: Sponsors' income or quotas. The associations are taxable only of the association's commercial income, i.e.: revenue from turnover with non-members. As mentioned in the motion for a resolution, account has been taken of the administrative burden on associations with relatively limited professional activities. Thus, the associations have the option of submitting a declaration instead of submitting a normal information document. This applies if the taxable income does not exceed DKK 100,000. before deduction of distributions and provisions. We therefore already have sensible rules and, at the same time, there are a number of challenges to the motion for a resolution tabled. Several of the associations included in the proposal offer a range of services which can naturally be said to be in competition with private providers. These may include renting rooms or rooms for accommodation, fitness activities, concert activities and café and restaurant activities. Thus, in the field of sport and culture, there is a wide range of associations providing very diverse services to non-members. This contrasts with the current tax exemptions, which cover much more limited areas such as schools, day care centres and museums. The proposed tax exemption would in fact only include income from the business activity of the associations in competition with ordinary taxpayers. This may lead to professional activities being run on a wider scale by associations which are thus able to outperform ordinary taxable companies, and we do not think this is appropriate. In addition, there is no direct definition, in the fiscal sense, of the associations covered. Furthermore, a tax exemption would also have to include foreign associations, as EU law requires equal treatment of Danish and foreign associations. The definition of tax-free associations etc. should therefore also be used in relation to non-profit-making foreign associations. Finally, for the sake of good order, I think it should be mentioned that a complete tax exemption does not mean that associations etc. no longer has administrative burdens. An association which has employees or which is liable to VAT will, of course, continue to have a number of obligations vis-à-vis the public authorities. The association must be registered with the Danish Business Authority, it must have a CVR number, and an association with employees must also be registered for A-tax, labour market contribution and ATP, and it must contain tax and report salary information to the Danish Tax Authority. To sum up, I therefore think that the current rules that we have today have a sensible balance on the taxation of the professional income of associations. A complete tax exemption would result in a number of delimitation problems and risk inflicting unintended competition on ordinary local operators, and the government would not be able to support the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182557	Thank you. Thank you, Minister. There was a brief comment. We'll take that with us. It's from sir. Sten Knuth, Left, Danish Liberal Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182608	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to the Minister for the speech. I regret that we are spending time here while Denmark is playing football right in these minutes. That is probably why it is not full of members of parliament. We are all in favour of what the Minister is also talking about, namely that the associations out there should have as little trouble as possible so that they can run their activities for the members they now have. I am also pleased that the Minister thinks it is sympathetic and that the Minister can support this proposal on a long stretch. But if this proposal actually makes it easier for the associations, why do the Socialists not support it? It also makes it easier for the Tax Authority, because they should not pick up these statements, which the Minister also talks about. If we look at the competition that can be contained and if this does not cost anything, why is it that the Socialists are opposed to this proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182718	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182719	When I think it is sympathetic, it is also because the rapporteur is very concerned about the conditions of associations, and I really think it is sympathetic. Our challenge here, which I also tried to outline in the speech, is that some associations will then be able to outperform an ordinary private company, a local company or something else. That is the basic challenge of the motion for a resolution here. In other words, if it is easier for the tax administration to administer and if there is less administrative trouble for the associations, then I am very much in favour of it. Hagen (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182815	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182816	Thank you. If it is the case that we can encapsulate the competition considerations that the Minister is also talking about, will the Minister help to look at the proposal that lies here? Because if it is the main anchor for joining us here, so that it can be easier for our associations, will the Minister help to see if we can encapsulate the competition concerns that the Minister is talking about?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182841	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182842	Good suggestions and ideas for that I would very much like to invite you to a cup of coffee. Then we can sit down and look at it together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182851	Then I thank the Minister. There are no more brief comments. For the rest, I can say that Denmark is ahead of 1-0. It was just an information for the rapporteur). Then the thrill of the first round went. Well, then, sir. Troels Ravn from the Social Democracy tripped to get to. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329182913	Thank you for the floor. And thank you to the Left for tabling this motion for a resolution. The authors propose to extend the tax exemption to certain self-serving institutions for the elderly, disabled and vulnerable, as well as non-profit institutions and associations in the field of culture and sport. As the Minister also says, the intention behind the proposal is actually very good. There are also many of us who, as children of society in Denmark, know that the associations are doing a huge job for both the individual members and our society. So the intention is good. It is also about eliminating the risk that many associations that otherwise operate in good faith will break the law by not paying tax on business income. However, the challenge of the proposal, as has already been said, is that the proposed tax exemption may run the risk of competing with ordinary taxpayers, due to the fact that associations and self-serving institutions in the field of culture and sport include a wide range of associations. These are associations which can also provide a very wide range of services to those who are not members, as was also said, for example. renting of accommodation and rooms for accommodation, fitness activities, concert activities and café and restaurant activities. These are services which will be in competition with private operators, and the tax exemption proposed here will therefore only cover income from the business and can therefore be operated in competition with ordinary taxpayers. So, for that reason, the Social Democrats cannot support the proposal. And I should say hello from Kathrine Ollldag from the Radical Left, Rune Lund from the Enhedslisten and Carl Valentin from the SF and say that neither can the three parties mentioned. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183112	It's noted. Thank you, sir. Troels Ravn. There are no brief comments. Now that there have been greetings from Carl Valentin, Kathrine Oldag and Rune Lund, we have come to Mr. Marcus Knuth of the Conservative People's Party. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183138	Thank you, President. It's going pretty fast today, isn't it? I'm sure this has nothing to do with the football game. I would like to thank the Left for a really fine proposal, which I can say right away we are very happy to support. I am sorry if my speech is a little short I am here today instead of our normal tax rapporteur but as I think Churchill once said: the shorter a speech is, the better it is. This proposal is simply common sense. It's good for society. This makes it easier for our associations, it makes it easier for the tax administration and, as Mr. Stén Knuth said just now, it won't cost you anything. So with those words, I can say that Conservatives support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183215	Thank you. There are no brief comments. So we're moving on to mr. Dennis Flydtkjær from the Danish People's Party. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183228	As I have said, this resolution is about requiring the government to submit a legislative proposal extending the tax exemption to a number of self-serving institutions. These may be institutions which have something to do with the elderly, the disabled or the vulnerable, and non-profit institutions. But it is also an extension of the tax exemption for cultural and sporting associations. It was actually part of the 2019 Finance Act, of which we were part, but it did not have time to be dealt with before the parliamentary elections, so that is why we have today's resolution, tabled by the Left. That is, in fact, a good thing, because then we will have the discussion in the Parliamentary Assembly. As it stands today, associations are actually taxable of professional income if, for example, they are: rents sports courts or premises. It may be a shooter's association that makes it possible for you to come and shoot with a shotgun, or the scout club that rents canoes out when they don't use them themselves. It is quite a good, sensible use of resources. If you still have equipment, why not make sure that others can use it for payment? But it's so taxable. In fact, we think it is quite sensible to give some good conditions to society in particular, so that they can get these revenues without having to run their foreheads against a bureaucratic wall where it is difficult to make it up. Perhaps you need to spend time and resources on an accountant who is going to help calculate the income and then subsequently pay a very modest tax to the state. But you also need to see that there can of course be some drawbacks to this. This could, of course, be a possible opening-up to some distortion of competition. Well, I guess you'd like a new scout club called the Flydtkjær Scouts. I'm the only member, and then I rent canoes next to the other canoe camp that sits and has to pay taxes on it. This may, of course, present some challenges, but this is actually mentioned by the Left in the resolution, in other words that it is one of the elements that will then have to be settled before a final legislative proposal is drawn up. And there I think it makes sense to get that part in, because that concern may be there, including on the part of the business community. But we join in on the side of society and also the self-serving institutions. We think it is important for them to be given good conditions, and that is why we think it is a very good resolution. We can see ourselves in it, and we can also support this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183441	Thank you. There were no brief comments here either. New citizens are running full-time with Mr. Lars Boje Mathisen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183448	It's good with soccer analogs. There is a President who would like to be somewhere else today, I can hear. It can't be hidden at all. This proposal comes back from before New Citizens came to parliament, and it's a little funny, because I've sometimes been a little after my good friends in the bourgeois camp for: Ah, couldn't they just have done the things they want when they had the power? This is one of the things. It's a lot worse with the financial room for manoeuvre. It was, with all due respect to this proposal, a slightly bigger thing that you didn't get that money out and back to the citizens. But let it go. This proposal is about Association Denmark, and there was one thing I learned when I was in Aarhus City Council, and it was that when someone starts saying that it is a sympathetic proposal, they always vote against it. It's such a password to say it's fine, but you vote against. I am not going to say that it is sympathetic, because I cannot say yet whether we are going to vote against it, because, as others have said, there is some ambiguity about this aspect of distortion of competition. It is both in relation to Danish, but in fact also in relation to foreign companies, which can enter the way EU legislation looks. Perhaps it can be clarified during the committee's proceedings or it can all end up with a report, because I hear from the government too, that if we can do something that can support society and make it simpler and easier and things like that, there is in fact a broad desire for it. I think that would be a good thing to take down from this, no matter what. And then it may be a little learning that the next time you want something, you have to hurry to get it through before there is a change of government.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183627	Thank you, sir. Lars Boje Mathisen. There are no brief comments. Now I'll see how far we've come on the list. No one from the Liberal Alliance, no one from the Free Greens, I think there was one just before the debate and no one from the Christian Democrats wants to speak either. Then we come to the rapporteur for the proposers. Sir. Sten Knuth from the Left, Danish Liberal Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183707	Thank you for that, and thank you to the Minister and the rapporteurs for being positive about the proposal. I hear it this way that if we can get this competition concern figured out, there is, in fact, a majority in favour of doing something that will ease the administrative burden for a great many associations out there. Well, we've got to get back to before the election. In fact, there was a majority in favour of that in the 2019 Finance Act, I would say to Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen, but we never got to roll it out, because then there was an election campaign, and then we didn't implement this. But at that time there was a majority for us to do this with the support of the government and the Danish People's Party. But peace be to it. Then we went to the election campaign, and in the election campaign many parties and, in particular, the Left spoke of facilitating the work of unification out there for the burden and the trouble. We had some concrete proposals and there was one of them, because if it were to be forgotten, we would certainly have it as an instrument during the period we are in now. In February 2020, we had a rather large resolution to try to remove some of the trouble with the associations. It was practically poured off the board, with a few exceptions on money laundering, which we are still trying to find out about, which makes it easier and actually also cheaper for the associations, that is, for small businesses as well. And now we're standing here three years later. I also remember that the Socialists in their paper of understanding with those who support it had written that we should try to lighten the burden of unification, but now we are standing here three years later and are still not a step further. That is very typical, I think, for some of what is going on around the associations. We can all say: that is really fine and we must try to do everything we can, but nothing really happens. Here is a sympathetic proposal, as the Minister says, and we will, of course, continue to do so. We will try to find a majority, like the whole parliament, so that we can make a report that this can be done if you fence in these competition concerns, and we will, of course, continue to work on it. But thank you very much for the speeches and for the support for the resolution here. I look forward to the work of the committee, but also to the cup of coffee promised by the Minister. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329183959	You're welcome. There are no brief comments. No one else has asked to speak, so the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Taxation. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329184033	The debate is open and the Minister for Tax has the floor. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329184037	Thank you. Today we are going to deal with a motion for a resolution by the Danish People's Party, which requires the government to set up a commission. It is always good with commissions to submit proposals for a simpler personal tax system. It is stated that the tax system has become so complicated that most people can no longer calculate their own taxes. Each year in March the Danes' annual statement comes out • We have just received it and again this year a huge effort is being made by the Danish Tax Authority to guide the citizens, both on tax.dk and via one-to-one guide on phone and email and chat. And measurements show that citizens' satisfaction with counselling is high. Last year, in 2021, it was 4,36 on a scale of up to 5 and it's very high, I can say in relation to the telephone instructions. The process of the annual statement shows, as most people already know, that the Danish personal tax system is one of the most digitised in the world. For the vast majority of Danes, the tax calculation consists of nothing more than checking their advance and annual accounts a few times a year. I share the opinion of the proposers that it should not be unnecessarily complicated for the ordinary Dane to find out what to pay in tax. But I'm not quite sure that's how the average Dane feels. So on the specific proposal. The proposers themselves make proposals for simplification, but at the same time say that these very proposals do not necessarily need to be continued. However, the examples illustrate how difficult it is to make real simplifications without conflicting with other and important principles for setting up the tax system. I will return to the examples in a moment after a fictional detour. I would like to tell you a fable published by the French writer René Macard in 1955. And believe me, I've simplified the fable. Once upon a time there was a country which had a tax system that had become so complicated that it was completely useless. One day, a member of the National Assembly came up with something wise. We could abolish all direct and indirect taxes which paralysed the tax system and replace them all with a single law, the first and last paragraph of which had only one line: all owners of umbrellas have to pay an annual tax of 1 000 francs. Very simple. The Member was immediately congratulated by both supporters and opponents. Everyone was enthusiastic about a proposal that united simplicity, fairness and realism and secured tax revenue. However, when the jubilee had settled, there were some Members who were worried. Should the tax not be lower on umbrellas made of cotton, as they were typically used by workers and white-collar workers when they went to work. This was, of course, a working tool. The lower income could be compensated at a higher rate for silk umbrellas, which were used by the bourgeoisie for walks. That, of course, sparked the debate, because what if cotton umbrellas were equipped with valuable handles? Here the total value of the umbrella could go and be higher than the value of a silk umbrella. The answer was, of course, an additional tax fixed in relation to the value of the umbrella handle. And more fundamentally, what about the economically disadvantaged people, the elderly, the young people in education? And how would the tax liability be distributed by handing over an umbrella? Should heirs of an umbrella also be taxed and much more? A committee was set up to draw up the general tax rates, with 19 exceptions. At the next meeting of the National Assembly, a representative from the umbrella industry spoke. After all, the umbrella tax was a distortion of competition in relation to the raincoat industry. Of course, the solution was a raincoat tax. And so the debate continued for months, but eventually the law was passed anyway. It had 1,245 paragraphs. Here I'm going to leave the fable because, by the way, it's gonna end really bad. After six months of umbrella tax, a powerful general launched a coup d'état and took power as a dictator. But the fable illustrates that the desire to make things simple very quickly collides with the desire to do things balanced. If you are curious, the fable can of course be found on the Danish Treasury website. The proposers highlight two examples of simplifications. One example was prepared by CEPOS in 2019. The central idea of CEPOS was to make it possible to calculate its tax by simply adding the relevant tax rates to which the income is subject. The then tax minister, Morten Bødskov, was asked by the Danish Parliament's Tax Committee to comment on the proposal. He considered it unclear whether the proposal as a whole could be said to involve real simplification. And I agree with that. The tax calculation would be made more transparent for citizens with very simple income ratios, but a new complexity arose in other areas. There should be, for example: a new intermediate tax, a special tax on pension payments and a tax reduction on pension payments is introduced. In addition, several existing elements were retained in the proposal in order to minimise the distribution effects of simplification. The special employment allowance for single parents and the additional pension allowance should therefore not be abolished. Thus, the tax for many citizens would still not be able to be calculated simply by adding the rates. The second example in the motion for a resolution of possible simplification is to change the base tax and the municipal tax in order to make the tax value of the tax deduction, i.e. the tax value of the tax deduction. allowances for all citizens, travel allowances, etc., as well as interest allowances for all citizens. Basically, the proposal is not a simplification but a change of direction. At any rate, I do not believe that changing the municipal tax and the bottom tax will make it significantly easier for the individual citizen to assess whether extra work is worthwhile. The authors ask whether it is fair that statutory deductions are of different value depending on where you live in the country. In fact, I am inclined to say yes to that. I do not think it is unreasonable that the deduction is greater for the people who live in a municipality with a high municipal tax. In addition, although the municipalities will still have the right to set their own tax rate, it will be more or less halved compared to today. The authors themselves say that the compensation system between the municipalities and the State should therefore be changed so that the economy of the municipalities remains unchanged. Apart from the fact that, as you know, it has proved very difficult to change the compensation system, the change seems to mean that probably all the municipalities of the country would become more dependent on state subsidies. So there is a long way to go to achieve a similar tax value of tax deductions and interest deductions. Although the proposers state that the two examples described do not necessarily need to be continued, the examples illustrate, as I said, how difficult it will be to simplify the tax system if the proposals are to be revenue-neutral, as far as possible have no distributional consequences, and if the marginal tax is to be kept at the current level or at a maximum cost of 2 billion. As the motion for a resolution shows. It is therefore difficult to see that a tax commission will be able to arrive at the result that the proposers want, without creating a different and comparable complexity. In addition, the proposal hits a tax administration which, due to inter alia: several large IT programmes launched on e.g. the property area and the debt area have an extremely limited IT capacity in the coming years. At the same time, many of the tax administration's IT systems are obsolete and face major modernisation. The restructuring of the personal tax system will have to be considered in conjunction with this modernisation, and the administrative consequences for the tax administration of a change are likely to be considerable. So yes, the personal tax system is complex, but there are many reasons for this, and for the vast majority of Danes tax calculations are more or less automatic without difficulty and actually quite transparent, just as the Tax Administration is making a great and successful effort to help those who need it. Against this background, the government cannot support the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329184904	Thank you for that to the Minister. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Dennis Flydtkjær. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329184907	Thanks for the speech. The Minister says, a little bit down, that it is true that the tax system is very complicated, but the reason why you will not be able to simplify it is that it is complicated. Can't you even hear that it sounds a little crooked? In fact, I think that most Danes out there would see it as a lottery whether you get money back or whether you have to pay money because you just can't see it through. If it is so complicated that it is difficult, it may be an argument for trying to make it simple rather than rejecting it because it is difficult. Could one not try to reconsider that if one agrees that it is too complicated today, why not try to make it simpler?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329184947	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329184948	You can make it super simple, because we can just say there's a flat tax, so everyone pays you no matter what. Then it's easy to figure out, it's easy to pay, and it'll be completely simple. We can remove everything else. It will be complex because we actually have a tax system which reflects some of the values we have put into it, namely that there is a difference in what income base you have, what kind of deductions you have, and all those things are made to create a fairer system. I think that the two examples mentioned in the motion for a resolution rightly illustrate - and this is also what I have tried to repeat - that what on the surface may seem like a simple model to be used is nevertheless quickly becoming complex.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185031	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185034	After all, we have a lot of tax discussions in the Danish Parliament, and it is typically about the ideological issue, namely whether the tax should rise or whether it should go down, but I do not really understand why we cannot agree that it should be simpler. If nothing else could be done to try it. I have not tried to pretend to anyone that this is an easy discussion. After all, we have introduced all the different patches for good reasons: it should pay better to work, a better move of income from rich to poor, etc. There's a lot of good consideration you've taken, but now there's just so many clasps on this system that no one can figure it out anymore. I really do not understand why we cannot agree that it should be simpler, and then we can take the ideological discussion afterwards. I really do not understand why it should be an argument, that it is complicated and that therefore we cannot change it. Then it is said that it is digitalised, but it does not make it more transparent for the citizen. Does the Minister not agree that it should be a right to be able to see through as a citizen why you pay the tax you have to pay? Then we can then discuss whether it is too much, but that one can see through it must be a right.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185127	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185128	I do not in any way question the rapporteur's intentions, and it is impossible to disagree with the fact that we need a tax system that is simpler, and I would very much like to take part in that. If there are good proposals, I would be happy to drink coffee while I hear about them, and I do not question the rapporteur's intentions at all. In fact, it can also be said that it is simpler, so why set up a commission? If there are any good suggestions for simplifying the tax system, I would be happy to look at them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185200	Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard, Left, Danish Liberal Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185202	That's the last thing the good tax minister said that made me push me in. Does this mean that we can get so far that it may be that the tax minister will invite us to some coffee meetings or something, to discuss whether we can make our tax system simpler, that is, where it is the same tax revenue and the same thing, but where we can actually discuss it? After all, the tax minister has been employed by the tax administration, and it is not certain that the tax minister knows it, but so have I. I have even been employed there for 11 years, and half the time was spent helping people with their annual statements etc., right? It wasn't easy to find out, and what was even worse was that it wasn't long before I went to the VAT area, and then suddenly I was going to help my dear husband with his annual statement. And you know what, I couldn't figure it out. It was hard, even though I had been employed for it. So can it not be that it might be a good idea for us to look at it somehow? I feel some kindness, so I would like to hear: is this something the Minister wants to take part in lifting just in one way or another?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185301	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185303	Yes, if anyone has good proposals for simplifications, I would be very happy to drink coffee in this respect; that is absolutely certain. I am just saying that, as far as most citizens are concerned, all information comes in via third parties, that is, our banks, our pension companies and other employers. They give in the information and then we go in a few times a year and check the information sheet that is available, and from there it becomes more complex for businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, etc. If there are good proposals for simplifications or things that can be made smarter, of course, I am always open to discussing it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185343	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185344	That is, of course, wonderful, but what I hear the Minister say means, at the same time, that there will be no initiatives to simplify the tax system on the part of the Ministry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185355	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185356	I do not know about the Ministry, but I would very much like, as Minister of Taxation, to look at how we make it more simple, and if I come across some good ideas, yes, if I even come here for harm to get a good idea myself, then I will clearly work to make it more simple. I mean, it's not a goal that it has to be complicated. On the contrary, it is an objective that we have as simple a tax system as possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185417	Thank you to the Secretary of State for Taxation. He has to go home and make coffee in a few minutes, but there are no more brief remarks in this round. I would like to welcome Mr. Brian Bressendorff of the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185430	Thank you for the floor, President. Honey's not simple, which is why we need you. This is how the Danish Tax Office wrote last year in a recruitment campaign, and that is basically right. Honey isn't simple. But who has actually said that it should be? In fact, the Danish tax system contains a great many considerations which are quite reasonable. We want a transport allowance to ensure that you can live anywhere in the country and that you are not unnecessarily punished by commuting far to and from work. We provide deductions for professional quotas to secure and support the Danish model and ensure that as many as possible can be a member of a union. We have a top tax to spread the tax burden to the widest shoulders. And that is how we could come up with a great many tax rates and deductions, and one for one we could conclude that they have been introduced for a reason. Yes, many considerations make things complicated. Moreover, in all other areas too. But these are considerations which we consider reasonable. As I can now hear, it seems as if almost half of the room has a background in the tax administration.I myself have that too, and I remember very well the older tax officer who accepted me on the first day. It was Svend. He had been in the Danish tax administration throughout his working life, and with a legal background he had many times been given the task of finding simplifications in tax legislation. And Svend said: Yes, it happens that you can find some parts that could have been done differently, but actual simplifications of the system would require you to drop taking into account and there are actually very few who want that. Since then, I have been in complete agreement with Svend. We need to use our tax system precisely to create desired directions through taxes or to take into account through deductions. As I see it, this proposal can do two things. It can either suggest that we should not take into account or that we should not create desired directions, as I have just said. But the second thing this proposal can do is to ask how things are really going for our income tax system. That discussion is of course interesting. The Danish tax authorities are among the best in the world to collect and collect taxes. When we have made measurements of how good we are at it in the past, it turns out that we charge about 98 percent. of the expected revenue in the area of citizens. The measurements show us that the citizens are very satisfied. And well, then, we probably have the world's most digitized tax system. Most of us only log in to TastSelf when we need to check if we've got money back or whether we have to pay a little extra. The vast majority of people don't think about their taxes... it runs completely automatically... and it's only when there are major changes in your life that you really relate to taxes. Perhaps the world's most digitized tax system is something that makes life easier for all of us, but which also ensures a more correct tax payment. So why this resolution? Well, in the Social Democratic Party, of course, we think it is important that our tax system is designed so that it is clear to the Danes what they pay in tax, and therefore we must also constantly focus on choosing the simplest possible solutions to concrete challenges in the tax system. After all, what the Danish People's Party is proposing with this motion for a resolution shares the intention that it should be transparent for the Danes what they pay in tax. I think that is a good thing. However, as I have just explained, at the same time, the proposal envisages a very complex and comprehensive restructuring of the personal tax system, which has a wide range of challenges. Back in 2019, the EPOS calculated a proposal to allow the calculation of its marginal tax by adding the relevant tax rates. At that time it was considered that the proposal would not necessarily mean a real simplification. The marginal tax calculation would probably be made more transparent for those Danes who have very simple income ratios, but at the same time it would mean greater and similar complexity in other areas. It is an enormous task to simplify the Danish tax system. The present system has been developed over many years by highly competent professionals, and at the same time it has been developed with the aim of taking account of both a number of political and economic factors. As I think it is now clear, we are quite sceptical about the idea that it should be possible for a tax commission to come up with a proposal which does not merely involve another corresponding complexity. We fully recognise the good intention behind the proposal, but instead of a Commission, we should keep the focus on a strong tax administration, which supports a solid counselling effort for citizens and which continues with good digital solutions. That is why the Social Democrats cannot support the proposal. Then I have promised to be a postman and send greetings from Enhedslisten, SF and Radical Left and say that they do not support the proposal either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185935	Thank you. There are a few brief comments, first from Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329185943	Yes, it does not make it easier to have a debate in the Parliamentary Assembly when all the parties are not there, but the rapporteur cannot help that. After all, he's shown up, and thank you for that. The rapporteur says that this is no problem as long as there is good guidance. But consider that, if we now had a simpler tax system, perhaps there was no need for guidance. Then people could find out for themselves. The rapporteur also says that it is a good thing that it is digitised because the tax administration can find out more easily. But what about legal certainty for the citizen? Should not the citizen also have the right to be able to find out what you pay in tax? In other words, there is both the bottom tax, there is the top tax, there is the employment tax, there is the job tax, the municipality tax, the list is endless and I agree that they are all introduced for good reasons. But is it really an excuse that, because it is difficult, we should not? Well, it should be the opposite, and at least you can try. I am not trying to pretend to people that this is an easy solution, and that is why I have proposed a commission and not just come up with a concrete model. However, do we not owe the citizens both legal certainty and because, as the rapporteur himself says, what is important is that it becomes clear, at least to make the attempt?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190040	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190042	If there are any concrete proposals on how we can simplify it, then surely I think we should listen to it. But I also think you should be careful not to make this into something that most people are thinking they don't have to deal with. I actually think most people are really happy that they don't have to deal with taxes very much, that this is something they can check max. once a year, and otherwise if there are major changes in their lives. Then I think we should stop simplifying an area like treasure. I really believe that in a well-developed country such as Denmark it is the case that the vast majority of areas require a high level of professionalism, and I would like to reveal to the rapporteur that my professionalism, for example. does not extend to the nurse's professional wound care or the pedagogy's work to include various diagnoses in a kindergarten. That's the way it is. There's a lot of professional skills out there, and we can't all hold them all. I think that is actually quite fair.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190140	Sir. Dennis Flydtkjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190142	The Socialist rapporteur says that you would like to look at it if there are any concrete models. After all, the motion for a resolution is aimed at setting up a group of experts who will have to come up with concrete models. But you're so against that. Can't you hear it going a little in circles? It has become so complicated today, and none of us in the Folketing can come up with a concrete model, and we need external expertise. But that is denied in the Social Democratic Party, and it is said that you will not. They must not come up with any concrete models that you would very much like to look at. Well, maybe it's just a bit contradictory. In fact, could it not be a good idea to get them to come up with concrete models that we can then screw on, just as we did with an electric car commission, an allowance commission? In other words, we have done so innumerable times in order to obtain a basis for decision which has actually been worked out and which we can then take a political position on. That's all I'm trying to say we have to do again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190226	Thank you. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190227	I also think it is forgotten that the Danish tax administration is constantly concerned about whether or not there is anything that can be simplified. I think that is wise, and I think we should continue to do so. I'm counting on you to do that, too. I think we should be careful not to think that some very, very simple model can be made, and I think that the fable that the minister so finely mentioned describes it very well, so that every time we think that we are doing something good for this, we might end up starting over, and we end up in another complexity. This proposal seems to me to forget.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190302	Thank you. Then it's mr. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190305	Well, with that logic, it could be said that all commissions that are set up are a waste of time, and the Service Commission would have been a waste of time if that is the attitude one has to everything that comes from there. However, the rapporteur himself mentions this here with fair and reasonableness and distribution policy and everything else, and it is true that a tax can be used as a distribution policy and behavioral regulation. However, the current government policy has reduced disposable income for all income deci sions and reduced the disposable income most for those who already have the least. Is that fair and fair? Is it socialist policy that it is they who must be hit hardest by a reduction in disposable income?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190349	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190351	I do not know what kind of specific tax initiative this is, as Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen refers to, but I think that right now it is a talk about how we can simplify this, and I think that if you go in and simplify the tax system that we have right now, you will just hit some of those who have the least in our society. It could, for example, be done. be in relation to the transport allowance, which is a helping hand for all those who commute very far. So I think it is important that we have a tax system that takes that into account, and I think that we are actually doing very well.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190423	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190424	I am simply mentioning the overall policy pursued by this government from time to time and that, in isolation, it results in a reduction in disposable income for those who have the least. So it is the government's own policy that I am referring to and what the policy pursued has had of economic importance. It is the rapporteur himself who says that fiscal policy is also a policy of distribution and fair and fair. So I just ask: is it right and proper that those who have the least in society are the ones who have received the least under this government? Is that fair?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190451	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190452	There have been no major tax reforms that have radically moved this over the last three years. After all, there is no doubt that there are some parts of what we have done that shift some marginal costs around. But on the whole, we use the tax system wisely and to make a redistribution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190521	Thank you. Then it is Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190524	Now I have absolutely no idea when the rapporteur was employed in the tax administration and how and how. But I think it is brave that the rapporteur uses the name Svend as something positive, I just want to say that. The IRS had to make things effective, simple and correct once. I do not know whether the rapporteur agrees with that; I would actually like to hear that. That's the SKAT motto. Do we still have to look at it? And do you still have to pay your taxes and nothing more or nothing less?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190602	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190603	Yes and yes. The tax administration is, in fact, heading in the right direction. We've had some challenges for a few years. I think everyone in here is both agreed and aware of that. That is why investment is made in the Danish tax administration. It is precisely to ensure that there can be a proper tax payment. This is done very, very well in many areas. It is precisely the area of the citizen that is one of the areas where we do the best. Perhaps that is why I am a little surprised that it is precisely in the area of the citizen that this proposal is chosen. It could have been in many other tax areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190640	Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190643	It could have been in a lot of tax areas, but now this is what we are dealing with. But when the tax is to be effective, simple and correct, did the rapporteur do as I did? Because I checked my advance statement, and all I was looking at was whether there was a green or red number. I can tell you that my place was green juhu. But does the rapporteur understand his own annual report?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190710	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190711	Yes, I relate to when there are some major changes in my life, such as... That I'm moving or that I'm changing jobs that do something about the big numbers. I go in and self-declare that, as I actually think most people do. And then it usually tends to fit roughly plus/minus in relation to whether you have to get back or have to pay extra. I really think it is incredibly nice that we live in a country where something so complex can be made so simple for most citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190745	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. We move on to the rapporteur of the Left. Here you go to the rapporteur of the Left, Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190819	Thank you for that and thank you for the floor. This resolution proposes requiring the government to set up before the end of this parliamentary year a tax commission with a view to a simpler income tax system. The Left agrees that the income tax system is complicated for the individual employee. We therefore welcome, as a starting point, measures to simplify the income tax system. Having said that, however, it is important for us that simplification does not happen at the expense of being able to pay off working. Simplification should not therefore lead to tax increases. But we are actually positive, and it must be understood that the Commission's proposal must be as neutral as possible, and the marginal tax must be kept at the current level neutral. We must also ensure that the proposal does not in other ways make it more expensive to be a Dane either. We note that expenditure on the Commission must be kept within what is referred to as the existing framework of the Ministry of Taxation. We would like to see this deepened in the work of the committee. In the Left, it is a matter of the essence that it must pay off to work. We agree with the proposers that a simple income tax system will contribute positively to making it easier to understand the benefit of taking an extra effort at work. That is why we are very positive about the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190936	Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Dennis Flydtkjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329190940	Thank you for your speech, especially the part of the one about how it should pay off to work. Because that is actually one of the problems of the way it is today. In other words, if you are asked whether you want to take an extra job on Saturday at the slaughterhouse or at the dairy, no one can see through whether it pays or how much you get out of it at least. Then the Left reaches among other things. Going out and saying that we should raise the employment allowance... which I agree with... isn't it a challenge if you can't figure out if working is worthwhile? Then we will not have the effect of lowering taxes at work either. So if we want to say to the Danes, as a solution to the shortage of labour, that it may well be that we have to have a higher employment allowance or lower the base tax, or whatever it may be, then we will not get the effect if people cannot see through it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191019	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191021	At least you can always discuss that if you do, because it's hard. We all know that we go out and take some extra work, it can be hard to figure out what happens next. How much do we really get out of this? None of us can really see that through. If you have to register advance payments, if you have an advance payment, or if you run the risk of doing something, do you risk paying top taxes? What is actually going to happen if you take an extra job? It's hard to see through, and it could be nice that we could better see through it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191052	Sir. Dennis Flydtkjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191054	Thank you for that answer. I actually think that we all have it and many Danes have it, as the Socialist rapporteur said, that when big things happen, people check, I think. That's right. But what, in everyday life, when people are asked if they can take extra work during the summer holidays, weekends or Christmas, or whatever it may be, and you sit and think: OK, what do I really get out of working? In other words, what is my marginal tax? No one knows this, i.e. with job allowances, employment allowances, bottom tax, municipal tax and top tax, and slanted tax ceiling, so if you live in the municipality of Lolland, you don't pay 15%. In top tax, you pay 13.6%. in top treasure. When there is no one who can see through what it is you pay in taxes, and why, we don't get the effect out of having to do extra work at Christmas or Easter.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191133	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191135	In any case, I would agree with the rapporteur that it is quite clear that it is one of the things that is involved in taking the extra money. I think we have all tried, at least those of us who have worked before we were here, to find out that if you have to work a few extra hours a week, what does it give out of income, because frankly that is why we are doing it. Well, that's for a little extra. What's the extra? Can I have an extra vacation? What can I get for this money? And it is nice enough to be able to see through what it actually gives of revenue for you, and that is something we cannot find out about today's tax system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191207	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. And then we've reached Mr. Marcus Knuth, rapporteur for the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191223	Thank you, President. I regret the confusion before I thought so many parties had greeted me that I thought it had to be my turn now, but of course there had not been greetings from the Left. At Conservatives we are very fond of simpler taxes and lower taxes. That is why we are very much in favour of this proposal. On the one hand, we have one of the perhaps most modern tax systems in the world that works electronically and so on, but unfortunately we see far too many cases where both citizens and businesses cannot understand the rules. Now Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær just that the top tax on Lolland is 131⁄2%. versus 15%. other places. If I had known, I might have stayed at Lolland, so thank you for pointing that out. Actually, I wasn't aware of that. And that is why cheating and unfair matters arise. We therefore welcome from Conservatives a work to simplify the rules, provided, of course, that it is important to stress that it is going in the direction of lower taxes and provided, of course, that it becomes cheaper to be a Dane, and that is at least how we read this proposal too. We are not quite clear about the cost of such a commission, but we assume, of course, that the cost of the work of the Commission is reasonable. And with these reservations, we support the proposal here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191338	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you, Mr President. Marcus Knuth. Then it is the rapporteur from the New Citizens' Party. Here you go, sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191346	Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, but now I have to judge slow. Dear Danish People's Party: You have served as a parliamentary basis for a government from 2015 to 2019, you have been in financial law negotiations, and you could have demanded in the government base and everything else that a commission should be set up, or you should have just made a political decision to simplify it. I would like these things to be done when you had the power, when you had the influence, instead of making the proposal now, when you are sitting as an opposition and you know very well that it is probably not being voted through. I agree with the intentions of this. It would be nice to create a simplistic tax system. I think we should, and I think we should also reduce the tax. But that's probably where the dog is buried, to simplify the tax system, without any adversaries happening to any human being, will probably be an impossibility. In some areas some will get more and others will get less. And then we go into the real political debate about who gets what. I think, for example, that it could be a very, very good idea to simplify it. We have made an economic plan where the first DKK 90,000 you earn is tax-free, and then you pay 37 percent. Baby. There is no labour market contribution, no top tax, we remove the registration tax on cars, we remove the electricity tax and so on. There are plenty of options for simplifying, and the best and easiest simplification to do is to remove something. Then you're free from having to sit and adjust it, then it's just to remove it. This could be done with the labour market contribution. We could also start with the top tax or with the registration fee on the cars. That should be something everyone in here could agree on. Why do Danish family fathers and mothers have to be punished with such high taxes for driving around in worse cars than they do in Sweden and Germany? Come on, stop it. Let's get this thing out of here. Instead, you create such a system where you say that mini-cars just get a little more expensive and then there are some electric cars that become cheaper. But if the electric cars are too big and too expensive, there will be a penalty tax on them. Then we make this kind of plugin hybrid cars because we tell ourselves that they are good for the climate, and then we make some completely horrible charging systems for them. I've only been sitting in here for a little over two and a half years, but none of what's been going on has been simplistic. Every time you turn something around and do something new in here, it usually gets more complicated. I wonder if this is the office we're gonna get here? At any rate, we do not see these changes coming from the political side, but I wish, and I hope that if power changes and we influence things, we can put ourselves together and get this much, much simpler tax system done. I'm with you all the way. However, as far as setting up a commission is concerned, I think we have a lot of commissions. I would like to see some political responsibility taken. It might be that we could try to hear the Minister whether negotiations on this would be called for. Then you could offer on the table everything you had on concrete proposals for these things. You could make that revenue neutral, but I don't think we're gonna get that right. It may also be that what was also the problem between 2015 and 2019 was that there were some parties whose views were different and which could not really agree on it. I remember no one wanting to lower corporate tax. DF didn't want to lower corporate tax, but that's what you want to do now, and I'm glad about that. So there were probably some changes there that could have been made. However, I have a question and it may be that the DF's rapporteur can answer it when he comes to the platform as rapporteur for the proposers: which of the parties from the bourgeois wing, who sat between 2015 and 2019, was opposed to simplifying the tax system? Because when you didn't introduce it from 2015 to 2019, there must have been some who were against doing these simplifications and who was it? Because there must have been some who opposed it. Otherwise, you'd have done it. But it is Tuesday and we are positive, and we are always in New Citizens. We look forward to it if we can put ourselves together in some negotiations and get these simplifications done. Then we're in it all the way. If we can also lower the tax a little, the smile just gets even bigger from here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191750	Thank you, and then there is a brief comment. Sir. Dennis Flydtkjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191754	Thank you for your speech to Mr. Knox. Lars Boje Mathisen. I think it's really good for Facebook, with about electric cars and everything else. That is just not what the proposal is about, so it would actually be nice if we were to deal with it now. I am very much in favour of the fact that it may, of course, cause some shifts or that it may be difficult to make a simplification without it shifting anything between income groups and other things, but that is actually why I have proposed in the motion for a resolution that you could make several different models, just as you did with the electric car commission, where you said that here is a model that gives 1 million extra electric cars, and it costs a great deal, and then you have some different models. You could make a model that was revenue-neutral, but you could also make one that cost 1 billion. kr., and one that cost 2 billion. kr. It's just that we get a basis for decision as politicians, and then we can take a position on that. The reason it is a commission is, of course, that it is so complicated today. I am happy to take responsibility for the fact that the Danish People's Party has been involved with all the other parties in the Danish Parliament for the last 20 years, but it does not change that we should try to do better now. Well, I think that is a bad argument, and I do not hear the rapporteur say that either, but that is what others say it is because it is complicated and then we should not do anything. It cannot be said that because nothing has been done in the past, we should not do anything now. I mean, if we can agree that we have to do something about it, we just have to vote yes. Then we shouldn't be pointing backwards. We have to sail the ship from where it is, and now we are here today, so why not just vote yes and say: yes, of course it has to be simpler?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191903	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329191904	We can sail the ship from where we are. We just have to make sure we have some good sails and a good engine, so we get to the right place. Because as I myself say, when you go in and make these changes that are being made continuously, they haven't been simplistic in my optics; then it's just gone the other way. So the first thing you have to do is look at what the definition of a simplistic is. Is it that you remove some different layers, is it that it is the entrance for citizens that gets easier, or is it the system? Where is it in the definition that the simplification should be? Because if you just make some straight numbers when you remove different things you can e.g.. you will have a somewhat more equal tax distribution. But would that be the definition of what would be a simplistic? So the question is whether it is a simplification and simplification, or whether it is a reduction in the different layers, because at the same time you have a change in the coefficient immediately, and the determination that is also required, one must be willing to take. For just something like the job allowance will create a change on the odd side, and if it is the one you put in front of a simplistic one, I do not believe that you will ever achieve it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192014	Sir. Dennis Flydtkjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192015	That is a good answer in the sense that it is clear that there may be ideological considerations. You can hear from the Socialists that there is the concern for the tax administration where I have regard for the citizens. I believe, moreover, that the rapporteur agrees that it must be transparent for the citizen, even in terms of legal certainty. So there is something in principle that you can actually see why you have to pay the tax you have to pay. Then we can disagree as to whether it is too high or too low, but that you have to be able to figure it out is something else. I clearly have an ambition to be able to remove some layers as well. One of the models that the CEPOS has come up with is that there are also some challenges to be faced by removing the employment allowance, the job allowance, but also the labour market contribution. It almost goes straight up. There are then some complications up against the pension tax, but that is what you have to look at, because it is complex. But it's quite clear that it's a goal to get some of these layers away, so it's more transparent. It has consequences, but you have to solve that. That's what this proposal is all about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192100	Thank you. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192101	We fully agree with that. Now I know that the rapporteur is always well prepared, so the rapporteur has probably also read our economic policy, where we in New Citizens are doing these simplifications by removing these different tax layers; removing the registration tax on cars, a flat-rate employment allowance, removing the labour market contribution, removing the top tax, so that you are not marginally heavily taxed on the last penny if you just jump over somewhere. After all, we want to remove all these things, which we regard as simplifications. Then I would say that car taxes have a great deal to do with being able to understand taxes. Because there's a lot of people standing there who don't know if they're buying that car or buying that car? Corporate car taxation: Wow, man, during the last reform it was made difficult so you don't really know which car you can buy now, and then you get an extra bill afterwards. So that's also something we need to take a look at. It's not gonna last.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192149	Thank you. Thank you, sir. Lars Boje Mathisen. And then we have reached the rapporteur for the proposers. Here you go, sir. Dennis Flydtkjær from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192159	Thank you. Welcome to this year's lottery: In fact, this might just as well be on the IRS website when people go in and check their annual statement. Because I actually think that a lot of Danes feel that way. For one's mostly everyone is that no one knows why you get money back or why you have to pay something. On Facebook you can see that some go in and cheer and say: Wow, I need 2,000 kr. Back up. But why isn't that 3,000 kroner?? Or why isn't it 1,000 kroner?? Nobody knows, and that's not how it's supposed to be. So we have to make it a requirement that people can at least see why they pay the tax they do. Then it may well be that a political discussion can then be held on whether there should then be higher taxation. Some people think so. Others, one could also listen to the previous rapporteur, think it should be lower. This is a perfectly fair discussion, but I do not understand why we cannot agree that, after all, it should be simpler. It is not an easy exercise, but that after all we should try, should really be something that was straight off the road for all of us. But unfortunately, it isn't. Over the years, the Danish personal tax system has evolved into a patchwork rug and today consists of a large number of rates and deductions, and I fully agree that they are all introduced for a good reason. It may be to motivate some behavior change, typically because we say that it should pay better to work. Then we got an employment allowance. And I take full responsibility for the fact that we've been involved in many of these things. But that doesn't change the fact that we should be able to stand together now to do it differently. So, we have bottom tax, which is municipal tax, top tax, top tax limit, slope tax ceiling, labour market contribution, personal allowance, employment allowance percentage, maximum employment allowance, job allowance, green cheque, transport allowance, deduction for professional allowances • and that is not even an exhaustive list. It could be much longer, but I will not spend all my speaking time listing tax credits, because we could go on. But it just shows: How can you find out as a citizen? I have been a tax rapporteur for many years. I've sat down and figured it out, but if it's true, I hardly even know myself. You can check that out on the annual balance sheet. But that's not how it's supposed to be. It must be a right that you can figure out your own treasure. The system has simply become too complicated. Common Danes can't figure it out. We often have a debate about it was also mentioned in one of the questions "Whether it is worthwhile to work." We're out of work now. Shouldn't we raise the employment allowance? That's a good idea. But if we are to get the effect out of it, it also requires people to be able to find out what they really get out of a higher employment allowance: if I have to take an extra job on Saturday at the dairy, what do I get out of it? Can I have an extra vacation, can I go to the movies, can I go out to dinner with the wife? So I do not believe that anyone can figure out quickly if you are asked by your boss whether you want to take an extra shift, what you really get out of working on Saturday. And then I do not believe that we will have the effects of it, and that is the second thing that is too bad about it, because I really believe that we all want it to be worthwhile to make an extra effort. But if you sit out there in the workplace and can't see if you get anything out of making an extra effort, that doesn't have any effect. I think that's a real shame. I simply think it should be a requirement for one to be able to see through one's taxes and I agree that this is an incredibly difficult task. But shouldn't we try? There are no easy solutions. After all, none of us can say that if there is anything concrete, I would like to say. But we can't do that to any of us. We need some expert assistance to set up models, as was the case with an electric car commission, with a daily allowance commission, a service commission. There are many times we have asked people to come up with some qualified proposals for us, and then we can negotiate from that. Then there may be corners that need to be cut off around, because you can't agree on it. That's quite fair. But at least to make the attempt we should be able to agree on. Well, now it's hard to make a pretty big round with whom to thank, because most parties have been lost from the debate. I think that is a democratic problem, but I cannot criticise you for that. However, I would like to thank the bourgeois parties who are here for supporting, if at least the intention in it, the direction in it, and thank the Social Democrats for, after all, coming up and taking up the debate, even if you do not support it. I think that's incredibly awkward. And then we'll have to try punk those who haven't shown up another time for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192558	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Brian Bressendorff.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192602	I have two small things. The first is simply a question of curiosity, since we are here anyway. It may well be that we come from different places, but where I come from, I have never seen anyone who, when asked if they can take an extra shift on Sunday, sit down and figure out whether it is worth taking the extra shift on Sunday and whether they can afford to go to the cinema with the lady. Out of curiosity, I just want to know if it's quite different from where I come from anywhere in the country. The second small thing is that I have been happy to see DF in the past being opposed to the new bourgeois proposals, which have come, where we have very clearly mentioned various areas and say: let us remove one deduction and various other tax rates. In the past, this has been opposed in DF. But now we are moving towards setting up a Commission to see if we can do any of that. If it is not for us to remove some of the things New Citizens have said, what are we going to remove? And if we're not going to remove anything at all, what kind of magical rabbit should be pulled out of the hat?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192707	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192709	I think the questioner is right to say that there are probably not many people who will be able to calculate it before they take an extra shift, but that is because they cannot find out. Well, no one can figure it out. That's the point of it. It is incredibly complicated to have to sit and calculate some employment allowance percentage up to a certain limit. Then there is a job deduction that starts somewhere else at another limit with a different percentage. You have to be able to sit and figure that out when you are just asked by the President at work whether you want an extra shift on Saturday. You can't do that, but that's what you should be able to do and that's what's the point of this. This has nothing to do with New Citizens' proposals, because New Citizens would like to reduce taxes, while the Social Democrats would like to raise taxes, and that is the ideological difference and that is quite fair. I'm actually gonna try to get around that, because otherwise, and I know that, we'll never get to anything in Parliament. Here it is actually a simple proposal that is just about whether it could not just be simpler. Then we can subsequently discuss whether the tax should be higher or lower or where the level should now be, because it is clear that there is a lot of politics in it. I really think that it should be straight off the road that we could agree that, after all, an attempt should be made to make it simpler. Well, I don't think there's a lot of people in the Folketing who can say they don't think it's really hard to calculate their own taxes, including myself. I really don't think it should be that way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192810	Sir. Brian Bressendorff.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192812	I can guarantee you that I don't know anyone who would sit down and count on • even if they could • whether it would be worth taking the extra shift on Sunday. Well, I think you're gonna get Lars Boje Mathisen to remove most of the...
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192829	We just have to remember this indictment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192831	I'm sorry, I think the rapporteur gets Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen agreed to remove most of the different taxes and all sorts of other things in the Danish tax system, but so far the Danish People's Party has been opposed to it when the debate has been there. So I still miss hearing what it is that you expect a commission to come up with when you have so far been against those parts and I am really glad you have been.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192854	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192855	I believe that we are trying to create a conflict that does not lie in this proposal. So, it is quite obvious that New Citizens are proposing to remove the top tax; we do not think so in the Danish People's Party. But that's not what I'm proposing with this proposal either. I suggest that it should be simpler, not that the tax should go up or down, but that it should be simpler. So it has nothing to do with New Citizens' proposals. You try to make some kind of argument to get your attention out of here. Now I mention again that you do not experience anyone who can calculate it. For example, I have. a big brother working night shifts in a machine factory. He's hit by the top tax limit or he's just below it and when asked if he can work extra on the weekend, he says no now. It's because he can figure out that he's going to pay too much in taxes, and that he gets too little out of it and then you don't bother. That's the point. It must be easier to calculate your own tax so that you can find out if it pays you to work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192939	Thank you. Then it is Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329192942	When I was a little younger, I lived in an apartment complex like this. They were condominiums, and we had a janitor. Then the caretaker stopped, it was a little awkward, and then one of the dear other residents thought about taking this janitor duty. It wasn't because it gave so much, but it did give a little, and it could be nice that it was someone who also lived there, because then you knew that there was sweeping etc. But he just couldn't figure out if he would have to pay top taxes, and he couldn't figure out what he got out of it, because of course we didn't pay super much in this property. What does the rapporteur think of the fact that he did not actually end up taking the job because he could not quite figure out what he was getting out of it, i.e. whether it would be worth taking the job that they say where I come from?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193026	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193027	Thank you for the example. This emphasizes the point that it is important that you can find out for yourself whether it is worth it at all, i.e. whether you get the benefit that makes you want to take the extra job or the extra guard on the job you already have. The rapporteur's example is a good one. Well, it shows that there are at least some who choose not to take the extra job. If we lose resources, we lose some labour, and that is really a shame in a situation where we are actually in need of labour.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193048	Then it's mr. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193053	I think we should then help the rapporteur's brother to be able to take an extra shift and then remove the top tax, so that was a good argument from here. But I would like to say that where I come from, there are also people sitting and counting on these things. One of the areas in which they are counting is the set-off, which is set-off in their own pension and set-off in the spouse's pension. This is something which the Social Democrats have been opposed to for a long time to remove. But there are people who are not born with a goldy mouth and who do not have much income, but have little income, who simply have to sit and count on it if they are offered this extra work. Let's say my crew comes and asks: Will you stay here for extra time? So I have to think: hey, I'm not really being taxed very much by this, because the help and subsidies we get for my spouse, who may be on early retirement or something else, are being deducted? I can promise you there, as a small comment, that there are people sitting and counting as low as 50 kroner, 100 kroner. and 150 kroner, because it actually has an impact on their annual budget.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193155	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193157	There wasn't much of a question in it. But I can fully confirm it. We also receive many inquiries about it with the set-off in the Danish People's Party, and although it is not about the tax system, it is the same principle that makes people sit and look at what they get from making an extra effort. And if you can't figure it out, or if the incentive is too small, you don't. That is also what Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard showed by her example. I think we should try to change that. As I said, it is not about putting the tax down or up, but about starting to make it transparent so that people can see whether it is worth working at all. That should be the least we could agree on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193228	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193230	Yes, I'm sorry there wasn't a question, but I've read up on the manual in the parliamentary work, and it says you can make a comment. It doesn't even have to be a question. Pandora's box has been completely opened to me. It's just gonna be a pleasure from now on. You can just make comments instead of questions. That's amazing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193244	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193246	There was no question either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193250	However, we must have the opportunity, as rapporteur, to give a reply. Thank you for that, there are no more brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the draft parliamentary resolution be referred to the Committee on Taxation. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193530	I would point out that the vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until Thursday 31 March 2022. The first person to speak is Mr Seligman. Uffe Elbæk, who is the rapporteur on the questioners, for a explanatory statement on the question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193603	Thank you. The reason why I have asked for this question at all is the issue which was described very well in Information from 24 January by Martin Gøttske, and he used a very graphic description of what we are facing, and now I quote directly: "In the geopolitical schoolyard, tiny Lithuania is right now being beaten by gigantic China. Meanwhile, Lithuania's classmates from the EU are watching with dismay without interfering. It was the description he had given of it in an article on 24 January and it made me so keen to ask the Foreign Minister what the government's attitude is to the massive pressure that China is putting on Lithuania, because it has allowed what was called Taipei's representative office to change its name to the Taiwan office of representation. It may sound like a small linguistic change, but it is a very, very large matter and what concrete action the government and the EU have taken to back Lithuania in this extremely sensitive and serious political and economic situation in which it finds itself. So that is the question to the Minister. And I'm looking forward to learning if you do something too, so I don't think those classmates from the European Union are just watching.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193739	Thank you, sir. Uffe Elbæk. Then it is the Foreign Minister for an answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329193748	First of all, thank you to Mr. Uffe Elbæk and the other questioners for today's inquiry debate, F 32. After all, questions are asked about the government's attitude to the Chinese pressure on Lithuania, as Mr. Uffe Elbæk explained. Secondly, the question arises as to what concrete actions the government and the European Union have taken to support Lithuania. I look forward to our debate in this Chamber today. I shall begin by explaining the matter and the specific and fundamental questions it raises. Lithuania announced in the summer of 2021 that Taiwan will open a representative office in Vilnius called the Taiwan representation office. This was received very negatively in Beijing, and China has since first put severe diplomatic and later economic pressure on Lithuania. The reason is that the name of the representative office breaks with a practice that Taiwan's representative offices abroad are called the Taipei Representative Office, as is also stated here in Denmark. It follows from Denmark's etkina policy that Denmark, like the United Nations, the EU and the vast majority of the world's countries, does not recognise Taiwan as an independent nation. This means that there are no diplomatic or formal political relations with Taiwan. On the other hand, Denmark has appreciated economic and cultural cooperation with Taiwan, which is being developed. We support meaningful technical cooperation with Taiwan also at the United Nations. The consequences of Chinese pressure on Lithuania so far are as follows: they called back their ambassador to Vilnius; they expelled Lithuania's ambassador to Beijing; they downgraded Lithuania's embassy in Beijing; a violent diplomatic move and Lithuania has, as a result, temporarily closed its embassy in Beijing. In the last quarter of 2021, the case escalated further. The PRC has imposed import restrictions on goods produced in or with inputs from Lithuania. In addition, China has imposed restrictions on exports to Lithuania and certain services are also included. Overall, it is clear that Lithuania is under enormous Chinese pressure. China has been communicating throughout the process that the matter is a bilateral matter between China and Lithuania, but other EU countries are also affected. The trade blockade has affected companies from a number of countries that use components from Lithuania in their production. That is why this is a matter of great concern to the rest of the European Union and, of course, to Denmark as well. The case is based on China's strong positions on Taiwan, but Lithuania, like Denmark and other countries, has the right to have a relationship with Taiwan. We share key common values with Taiwan and we have close economic relations. Therefore, Denmark also has a trade representation in Taipei, just as Taiwan has an office in Copenhagen, but the relationship must be handled within the framework of etkina policy. Denmark, like the EU and the rest of the international community, has a clear and firm etkina policy, and the Danish Parliament has repeatedly expressed its support for Danish etkina policy. Although Lithuania in Chinese optics has crossed a red line, it does not justify China's punishment of Lithuania, so let me state the government's position on the matter. China's treatment of Lithuania is completely disproportionate and totally unacceptable. During the whole process, the Government has shown solidarity with Lithuania. I have expressed my full Danish support and sympathy with my Lithuanian colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with regard to the difficult situation in which the country finds itself. I have raised the matter with China and during the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in November 2021 I expressed concerns about China's treatment of Lithuania. In addition, I have raised the matter on several occasions in meetings with my Nordic and Baltic colleagues and called for cohesion against Chinese pressure. In the European Union, I have worked to ensure common EU positions and statements in support of Lithuania, and in January, the EU case brought up the WTO and received support from, among others. USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and Taiwan. It is the European Commission's opinion that there is a strong case, and I am very pleased that both the European Union and like-minded countries have in this way said clearly against China's pressure on Lithuania. At the same time, the EU continues diplomatic pressure on China through bilateral channels. The crisis between Lithuania and China has made it clear that there is a more general need to strengthen the EU's resilience to external economic pressures, and this requires a broad range of efforts, including those of the EU. a more strategic approach to trade policy, based on the principle of open strategic autonomy. For we must be better at defending ourselves against unfair conduct by the outside world, but this must not lead to the European Union closing itself down. Work on upgrading the toolbox has already started, and this will be accelerated in the near future. Among the actions taken in recent years is the modernisation of what we call the defensive trade instruments, the introduction of a common EU mechanism for sharing information on countries' screenings of foreign investment on the grounds of national security. In March of this year, agreement has been reached on a new instrument to ensure a greater reciprocity in public procurement, and the government supports that the EU should have effective instruments to protect itself from unlawful conduct. The European Union must be able to deal with situations where, for political reasons, third countries expose the entire European Union or individual EU Member States to economic coercion or blackmail, as we now see with China and Lithuania. That is why we will also look with interest at new proposals from the Commission aimed at such situations, for example. the proposal for a trade instrument designed to prevent and counteract forced action by third countries against the European Union and its Member States, the so-called anti-coercion instrument. In this context, it is important that new instruments become balanced and proportional so that it does not unintentionally escalate the conflict further. The EU's starting point must remain a dialogue and negotiation-based approach that supports the rule-based international trade order. So let me sum up: the Chinese behaviour towards Lithuania is unacceptable and disproportionate, the government and the European Union have acted, we are united in solidarity with Lithuania, and we are putting counter-pressure on China through diplomatic channels and bringing the matter before the WTO. In addition, and this is important, the EU is upgrading its toolbox of trade and protection instruments, so that in future we are better equipped to face pressure from third countries. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194528	Thank you. One brief remark from the rapporteurs is now available, and the first one is from Mr Beazley. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194535	Thank you. The gift of doubt can sometimes be very useful, including in foreign policy, and I wonder whether the Foreign Minister will never consider whether the policy of etkina is a proper policy. Because if the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not considering it at all, why is it that one hundred percent is supported around Lithuania? In other words, in contrast to Danish politics and contrary to EU policy, Lithuania has carried out such a little childish provocation towards China for which they are then punished. Or is there a reason for the grace of doubt when we talk about etkina policy towards China? Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194628	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194630	Thank you, sir. Søren Søndergaard. What is important to emphasise is that the way China reacts to Lithuania in a bilateral dispute, as it is, about some representation from Taiwan in Lithuania, is completely out of proportion. The way and instruments of China, for example. It is therefore important that the government has worked to ensure that the whole of the European Union together gives a response to this kind of attempt to push a Member State on the basis of something that is totally disproportionately. It is very important, and therefore also said that we have both brought the matter up to the WTO, that we develop defensive trade instruments, and that I have also expressed my solidarity with Lithuania, as the Danish Foreign Minister, and that I have also taken the matter up with the Chinese Foreign Minister during my visit last November with a call to resolve this in a constructive way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194727	Thank you. Then it's mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194730	Thank you to the Secretary of State. We fully agree that what has happened is totally unacceptable. That is why, I think, we could make a very, very strong symbolic decision from the Danish side, and that would be to equate the representative office of Taiwan here in Copenhagen with the representative office of similar areas, for example. President. - I call the Group of the European People's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). It is an office that we do not recognise as, we should say, the representative office of a country. We do not recognise Palestine as a country, but yet they have better diplomatic status than, for example, they do. Taiwan's representative office has here in Copenhagen. Therefore, if we really believe that action should be taken behind words, while at the same time sticking to our etkina policy, then we could, as it were, upgrade it to the diplomatic status, where it will be given the same status as, for example. Palestinian self-government. So will the government put action behind the words and make sure that we mark that here we can make some symbolic policy that will actually mean a great deal, not least in relation to the Taiwanese?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194831	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194832	I'd like to say to Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen, that it is really important that we stick to our overall and not just Danish policy, but also to the policy of all EU countries in relation to China, also because we all have an interest in the status quo over the Strait of Taiwan. This also means that we have a policy of etkina, which I also support in the Left. This does not mean that we should not do everything we can to strengthen our economic and cultural ties with Taiwan. After all, Taiwan shares many of the values that we also stand for democratic values. It is important that we cooperate in the time available. We will focus on that. But I don't think we're going to focus on symbol politics. We will focus on making a real difference in our relations, not least in relation to Taiwan.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194919	Then it's mr. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329194921	I think there have already been two damn good questions. But they have both gone to Taiwan a little bit, and I will try at least for a moment to pull it back to Lithuania. For the Minister for Foreign Affairs gives a very good overview of what has happened, what has been called on the European Union to do, etc. etc. But what concrete support has Lithuania received in economic or political terms? Has the Foreign Minister been in direct dialogue with his colleague in Lithuania? And is the colleague in Lithuania satisfied with the response and the level of ambition that has been put in relation to the response from the European Union? Because when I talk to colleagues over there, they are deeply frustrated that that support is not more concrete.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329195016	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329195017	I'd like to say to Mr. Uffe Elbæk: Perhaps it was not clear, but as such I have been in a good and ongoing dialogue with my Lithuanian colleague, the Foreign Minister, who has also appreciated the Danish efforts, among others. that we have taken the matter up directly with the Chinese Foreign Minister during my visit last November. I think I mentioned that before. In particular, it has been important for Denmark, together with the other Member States of the European Union, to support the totally inproportional and unreasonable treatment of Lithuania, among other things. by addressing the issue in the WTO, as we have done, and putting pressure on China from the European Union and also in other relevant multilateral fora. Moreover, I also expect, and we have called for this from Denmark, that the matter will be brought to the EU-China summit which will be here on 1 April, in other words in a few days' time. It is, of course, important that a Member State should not be treated in this way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329195115	Thank you. There are no more brief comments, so thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We shall now proceed to the debate and to the general rules for short remarks. The first to speak is the rapporteur for the questioners. Here you go, sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329195135	Now we're kind of warmed up. However, I would like to clarify my reasons for wanting this debate. This is because of such a very personal conversation with a political colleague in Lithuania, named Dovile Sakiene, if I say the name correctly. She's a good social democrat, I'll tell the government. She expressed enormous frustration from the point of view of Lithuania. They simply need some more significant action from the European Union, namely financial support for the country or more concrete response to China. When China prevents Lithuania's products from entering China, should we somehow do something similar with China and their products into the European Union? That's why I thought it was important that we discuss this. It was also clear that she felt and felt that they stood very alone and that they took a fight on behalf of all of us, in relation to the massive pressure that is from China. After all, it has all been given a much more serious keynote after the attack on Ukraine. I have no doubt that China is sitting here looking quite carefully at how the European Union and the rest of the world are reacting to Russia and thinking that if it goes there, then their reflections on possibly attacking Taiwan have increased considerably. So in this case, there are three parties. There is Lithuania, there is China, and that is Taiwan. And I sincerely welcome the work done by the Foreign Minister in raising the debate, both to his colleagues in other EU countries, but also directly to his colleague in Lithuania. I believe that this debate is of great symbolic importance to our colleagues in Lithuania and that they will follow what we say here and what we decide. In a phrase inserted, I would say that in a moment, my colleague from the Socialist Group will read out a joint text for adoption, and I know that text they are sitting over there waiting to hear. They want to know what the response has been to the Danish Parliament in relation to the problem they are facing. I think that the situation is very, very serious and that Lithuania is just a test of how far China can go in relation to other European countries too. After all, China is putting overwhelming pressure on individual countries, but also on people and organisations, and that is overwhelmingly sophisticated pressure. So, it goes to the economic, political, cultural, and there is no doubt that parts of the national security law that China decided a year ago were not only directed inwards at China, but also externally to silence critics of China. No matter where they're on the planet, you can see this law coming into character. In my discussions with the representatives of Taipei's representative office here in Copenhagen, they have expressed some wishes. One of the wishes has already been raised by the rapporteur of the Left, namely whether the status of the Palestinians can be obtained because there is comparability there. But there are also requests for Taiwan to be included in other international forums that are insanely important to them. So, one is the WHO, as the Foreign Minister has also mentioned, but they themselves raise questions with Interpol. They have raised it in relation to the aviation security organisations. They have raised it in relation to UN climate organisations. Because these are all issues which are of course important for how they can act as a society where they are now. To conclude, I am very, very pleased with what the Foreign Minister has done in this area, but I have no doubt for a second that they in Lithuania need very concrete action. They're insanely pressured financially. So what can the European Union do in this context? I look forward to hearing what my other colleagues have to think about this, in other words how we can both support Lithuania, but also Taiwan, and oppose the massive pressure that China is exerting today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329195655	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you, Mr President. Uffe Elbæk. Then it is the Social Democrat rapporteur, Mrs Annette Lind.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329195704	Thank you for that, President. First of all, I would like to thank the proposer very much, Mr President. Uffe Elbæk, for taking this debate, thank you for Mr. Uffe Elbæk was so pragmatic to call me first and ask that we could make a joint text for adoption. Instead of making many small texts for adoption, Mr. Uffe Elbæk, that it was important for us to have a broad text of adoption. I did, and I'm really, really happy about that. I think it is very valuable and a good signal that we now have a common support from a very broad majority in the Folketing. What this case is all about is explained to us. It is about the fact that there is economic and political pressure on Lithuania from the Chinese side, and this is because Lithuania has allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in Vilnius called Taiwan's representative office, and indeed that decision is controversial and disliked in China, because Taiwan is not recognised as an independent nation. Lithuania's decision is therefore a breach of the usual practice, which we are also following at home, that there is no diplomatic or informal political relationship with Taiwan, and that Taiwan's representative office abroad is therefore referred to as Taipei's representative office. As we have also heard the Minister say, China's reaction to this has been very violent and out of proportion. On the Danish side, we say clearly against the Chinese blackmail and support Lithuania in this situation, and it is clear that it means a lot when you get a personal story, as Mr. Uffe Elbæk got from the good social democrat from Lithuania because things are seen from a completely different perspective. We have been able to see that ourselves today with Zelenskyi, when he spoke directly to us and looked us in the eye. It is therefore important that we now stand together both at home in Denmark and across Europe in solidarity with Lithuania, and so I would like to thank you for having this broad support in the Folketing. In fact, I would say that I do not think that we in the Danish Parliament are standing with our arms down like a class that is so completely apathetic, but that I think that we here in the Danish Parliament have shown ourselves to be responsible teachers who have taken control of the class. So I'm really glad about that. With regard to the text of the adoption, I would like to read it out, and I am pleased to say that it is in fact all the parties of the Folketing that are in this text of adoption, that is to say that we agree from end to end. And we're taking advantage of all 150 words, and I'm reading it now. Proposal for adoption The Parliament expresses concern about the crisis between Lithuania and China. The Folketing considers the economic and political reactions of China to Lithuania to be disproportionately and unacceptable. China's reactions to Lithuania concern the whole of the EU, and Parliament therefore calls for Denmark and the EU to be united and in solidarity with Lithuania. The Folketing notes its continued commitment to the Danish etkina policy, from which it follows that Denmark, like the United Nations, does not recognise Taiwan as an independent nation. On the other hand, Denmark has appreciated economic and cultural cooperation with Taiwan. The Danish Parliament welcomes the fact that the EU has brought China's action to the WTO and that the Foreign Minister has taken the matter up directly with the Chinese Foreign Minister. Parliament calls on the government to continue to work to ensure that the EU actively supports individual Member States subjected to undue economic coercion or blackmail, that the EU raises China's pressure on Lithuania bilaterally towards China and in relevant fora, and that Taiwan is granted observer status on WHA. V 56). And those were the words.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200100	Thank you for that and we will allow them to be included in the further negotiations. Here you go. There's one brief comment from Mr. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200108	I am also very pleased that we have a broad text for adoption, and that text specifically mentions WHA and, as I said in my brief speech before, I know that it is important for Taiwan to get into some of these international organisations or at least to have observer status, because it has an impact on how they can make their society at all coherent. Whether it is air safety in and out of the country or criminals in and out of the country, they would like to participate in the forums where this type of information is shared. So what is the rapporteur's position that it is not just in the WHA, Taiwan is represented, but that it is also in a number of other organisations?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200159	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200200	From my point of view, it is very positive that you have influence in the places where you are. We know this from our Kingdom community. There we also have our countries that want to become members in many places. But here it is the WHA, which I know many of our colleagues here are fighting for, and I see that as very valuable. In relation to the fact that we are bringing the Danish Parliament together on the text of the adoption, I would just like to say that many of us have done exactly what we have done for it, and fortunately we have succeeded in doing so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200236	Sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200237	As I hear it, if I now interpret it positively, the Social Democrats understand that Taiwan would like to be included in this series of other international organisations, and we also heard the Foreign Minister say that there is good cultural and economic cooperation with Taiwan. Does the rapporteur have any suggestions on how to strengthen this cooperation beyond what we are already doing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200307	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200308	We would like to see more trade with Taiwan. We also believe that the cultural background should be strengthened, and that is why we want to work for it, and I also know that in the Free Greens we are working very hard to do so in artistic areas. However, at all events, we in the European Union must stand together on this, and I think that has actually succeeded quite well, and I am also looking forward to our not stopping here. For 1 April, that is to say on Friday, there is a summit between the European Union and China, and I hope that some of these things will be put on the agenda. And I also very much hope that the Lithuanian friends of the rapporteur think that we have made an effort here in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200348	Thank you to Mrs Annette Lind. The next rapporteur is from the Left. Here you go, sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200402	Thank you very much, and thank you, Mr President. Uffe Elbæk, for it is of course about something really, really important, not least in the light of China's action in general. One thing is how and how China strangles a small country in the Baltic because they stand up for values that they think are important. This is serious in itself, but at the same time it is even more serious when we see that China is beginning to act extremely aggressively in general. We see this not least in relation to Taiwan, where their rhetoric is getting worse and worse. We also see it in relation to military overflights and military ships approaching the coast, so that the Taiwanese themselves are starting to get really, really nervous about whether this now means a military invasion. That is why they come to us and say: What can you do about the free society that we want to be part of? What can you do to make us stand on the same side as you? I very, very clearly want us to do everything we can to put an end to China's aggressiveness, while, of course, it must go hand in hand with what has been Danish foreign policy for decades. It was in that light that my question to the Foreign Minister should be seen, because I think we can give out clear support to Taiwan without conflicting with previous policy. That is, for example, the case. By upgrading Taiwan's representative office to the same status as the Palestinian office in Copenhagen. Nor does the Left support the recognition of Palestine as a country now, in the same way as we also support the ethina policy in relation to Taiwan. That is why this is something that I have been asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for several years, in fact, and every single time I have been told: it is a little difficult, but perhaps you can. If we really wanted to, we could do this. And if we really wanted to do symbol politics too, yes, I use the word symbol politics, we could do it too. Why is symbol politics sometimes important in foreign policy? It is because symbols have an impact on the countries it concerns. Taiwan has the desire to truly be part of the democratic world, while China will do all they can to stop the positive developments that are in Taiwan. Why, then, should we not be able to choose sides every once in a while? That is why I can clearly say that we support the proposal for adoption. Because it is moving in the right direction, with Taiwan becoming a member of the WHA, that is to say the political arm of the WHO. We think this is really, really important. I can say that Palestine's area of autonomy is in the same way in the WHA. At the same time, however, I also think that we should use the opportunity to go further, and that is why we at least think this discussion is really, really positive. I very much hope that the Foreign Minister will also be able to follow up on this, because I think that is something that we might perhaps agree on and still not get into carambola with etkina policy. So, with these comments, we support the proposal for adoption.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200721	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There are a few brief comments. First, it's from sir. Søren Søndergaard from Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200726	Thank you. However, does the rapporteur not agree that the policy of etkina actually limits what we can do beyond the policy of symbolism? I do not object at all to the fact that symbolic policy is also of great importance in foreign policy, but that it maintains a policy of etkina and does not, like, open up a debate on whether it is right, it also states that there are clear limits to what we can actually do. Isn't that correct?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200806	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200806-2	Yes, it is. And I think we should be honest about that too. There were predecessors before us, who I think are back from the 1970s really, and I think perhaps even in Mr. Poul Hartling's time made it back then. Of course, we stand by that. That decision was taken, and that is the decision taken by both red and blue governments for decades as a policy. So I don't want to question that at all. And, yes, of course, there is the consequence that there is a framework for what we can do. That is also why I think that the specific proposal we are making to give them here, we should say, the same diplomatic status as some from another area, we also do not recognise as a country could be a situation in which we both recognise the policy to date and at the same time do something that will mean something for Taiwan.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200855	Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200856	Then Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen actually didn't delete at all
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200907	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200908	I think, sir. Søren Søndergaard knows me well enough to know that there are quite a lot of things I would like to question, but unfortunately cannot.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200915	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment from Mr. Uffe Elbæk of the Free Greens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329200919	Then it is almost a pity that I am going to ask the same question, because I really thought it was interesting how the rapporteur from the Enhedslisten raised the question of the whole of the etkina policy, i.e. it is such a taboo that we simply cannot discuss. I was really pleased to hear the position of the Left, i.e. if we cannot upgrade the status of the representative office at least in relation to Palestine's. However, in parallel with the policy of etkina, we also have a State policy towards Israel and Palestine. Now we are not going to start that discussion, but I am just saying that sometimes there are some taboos where everyone says that it is and that it cannot be otherwise. So could the rapporteur be open to • not tonight, because we need to find the right framework for discussing, taking stock of whether it is right that we remain so cement-like in relation to etkina policy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201021	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201026	That is why I can make a small advertisement: I am the chairman of the Danish-Taiwanesian Friendship Association in the Danish Parliament, and that is why it could be a very good discussion, and I think that is quite sincere. It could actually be a very good discussion to take in that group and simply try to nerd down a little too, and I think that again positively in taking that discussion. So I actually think that could clearly be a forum for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201046	Sir. Uffe Elbæk, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201047	I'm going to back that one hundred percent because I think it's needed. And without already formulating the conclusion of that, we will at least have a framework, a space to take the discussion frankly and openly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201102	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201104	A hundred percent agree.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201108	To Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen. There are no more brief comments. And then we welcome the SF rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201113	However, it is amazing how China has managed to bring together the worst of capitalism and communism. I know it's a myth that you should be able to see the big wall from the moon. It is a myth, but I am quite sure that if you erected an appropriate monument over the country's violation of democracy and human rights, you would see it from outer space. China is also an interesting hybrid when it comes to a combination, on the one hand, of economic and military strength and, on the other hand, of completely excessive tenderness and readiness to violate, which nevertheless gives the rear wheel to most other countries. I am thinking here, for example. on the drawing in Jyllands-Posten or on Jens Galschiot's Pillar of Shame down at Slotspladsen. After all, Denmark has the right line in recognising Fastlandskina or Beijing as a representative of China. At the same time, however, it is a fact that Taiwan exists as an independent country which, moreover, must live with a tough Chinese aggressiveness when it comes to both aircraft and fleet as they approach Taiwan's borders. With regard to the fact that Fastlandskina is hypersensitive to any rapprochement with Taiwan, it must nevertheless be the decision of each country to decide what relations they wish to have with Fastlandskina and Taiwan respectively. China, as usual, is trying to crack down on countries that depart from the slightest. It was probably in the vicinity of 10 years that China put Norway on ice because they had a committee, the Nobel Committee, which had given a dissident a prize. Now China's reprisals are hitting Lithuania, but the answer here must be that we stand together in the European Union and that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Lithuania and do what we can to bring them back to normal. The SF supports the proposal for adoption. And then I should like to greet our acquaintances in the Radical Left and say that they are in complete agreement with the SF in this matter at least.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201351	There is a brief comment right here on the table. Here you go, sir. Uffe Elbæk. And thank you for the rapporteur's speech.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201356	I would just like to take this opportunity to say that the whole Chinese discussion has really moved within the last few years, and Karsten Hønge has, if anyone, been part of it. When you stand in front of Jens Galschiot's sculpture and feel the pressure, and it is a massive pressure that China puts, and in this case it was the Bureau of the Danish Parliament that should not allow that sculpture to be set up, and afterwards it was the City of Copenhagen, and I personally have a warrant hanging over my head, you have to ask: How do we formulate a new Chinese policy that corresponds to the pressure that we experience, both at the personal level, at the business level, at the national level and in this case, where we are discussing Lithuania? Is there no need to formulate a new Chinese policy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201455	Sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201455-2	In any case, we are open to this fundamental debate. I also believe that we must be boringly realistic and say that, to the extent that Denmark has to change its policy towards China, it has to be done in a coordinated movement with the EU, or at least with as many other countries as possible. China, as I mentioned, has a very boring tradition of striking down exceptionally hard, especially on smaller countries. They step on them, they bother them, and in every way they make life miserable for them, as it was for Norway for 10 years. Now they try again against a small country like Lithuania. So I do not think it would be a good strategy if Denmark alone fundamentally changed Chinese politics.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201543	Then I would like to give the floor to Mr Seligman. Søren Søndergaard. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201546	It is true that China has a tradition of hitting hard on countries that criticise them and their businesses and so on, but we cannot subject ourselves to that. I would therefore just like to ask whether the SF's rapporteur agrees with us in the Enhedslisten that from this debate we should also send a very clear signal to Danish companies that they can safely invest in China, but only if they are ready to lose any crown, because they should not come to us afterwards and say that we have now lost their business adventures with criticism of China. Does the SF rapporteur agree with the position of Enhedslisten?
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201633	Sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201634	First of all, I agree with myself that it is always a message to companies when they invest that it is at their own expense and risk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201645	- Do you want to see him? - Yes, sir. Søren Søndergaard a second brief remark? He doesn't. Then there are no more brief comments. Thank you, sir. Karsten Hønge from SF. And then we should welcome the Enhedslisten's rapporteur, who has been greeted by the Radical Left rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329201705	As a starting point, this debate is about the way in which China has dealt with Lithuania, and there we have produced a resolution that is good and which Enhedslisten can fully support in relation to everything that it says there. We believe that it is important to refrain from the way China behaves towards Lithuania; we also believe that it is totally disproportionately, so that part of it we can easily support. That being said, if we go a little below the surface, reflect or reflect this discussion two deeper layers. One layer is not just China's behavior towards Lithuania; it is China's behaviour in general when they get criticism abroad when abroad, other countries, other people, do something they don't like. The Galschiot statue has been mentioned down here in the square. It may also be theaters who play a certain theater performance. It could be anything. And it is clear that we must use the same standards as we do in relation to the case of Lithuania and say that this is totally unacceptable. Fortunately, we also have on, among other things. The cultural area in Denmark discussed this here and got a clear awareness that China should not decide what, for example, is going to happen. must be displayed on Danish theatres. China should not decide which caricature drawings are in Jyllands-Posten, and so on. It is therefore a layer that lies underneath, which is much, much wider and much, much larger, and which in reality requires a much more comprehensive answer. It is in this context that I have repeatedly said to the Danish business community: Invest just in China, but be ready to lose every penny. Because we will not risk being in the situation where Danish business comes to us and says: Uh, you must not criticise China, because then our investments will suffer. That's it. Now they know, and then they're gonna have to lose the money. That's the way it is. Because at least they can't say they weren't aware of it. Then there is another layer of this discussion, this question, and that is the one that deals with the question of etkina policy. So, in the Enhedslisten, we have always recognised etkina policy as a starting point. Why? We have done so because the division of China was the result of imperialist colonial occupation in the region. Hong Kong was occupied by Britain and was a British colony until 1997. Macao was a Portuguese colony until 1999. Taiwan was a Japanese colony until 1945, after which it became the refuge of Chiang Kai-shek troops who were the losing party in the civil war. In this context, akina policy made sense. But there's something going on with the story. Well, things are evolving. And that is why I am a little nervous when people say that we have always had that policy, so we must continue to have it. One might say that a very crucial turning point when we are discussing this with the etkina policy is Hong Kong. 'Cause when Chris Patten says Mr. Patten... Chris Patten? I do not know that left Hong Kong back in 1997, it was after all on the basis of a clear agreement with China, which came under the name of one country, two systems, and recognising that Hong Kong's people were able to control their own territory themselves. After all, that agreement has been totally violated by China, with the imposition of democratic rights, the beating of Members of Parliament, the imprisonment, the imprisonment and exile of parliamentarians and other democracyists, and I think we just have to reflect on that. I do not want to say that our reflection is complete and I do not want to say that we are saying here that we should abandon the policy of etkina. However, as far as the opinion is concerned, we are at least interpreting it in such a way that, with regard to what it says, the Folketing confirms its decision, it is confirmed that that is what is the decision today, but that it does not bind anyone to say that it cannot be discussed, nor does it bind anyone not to say that it can be changed. So I think we have the benefit of that discussion, and I look forward to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202206	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There is also a brief comment here. Here you go, sir. Uffe Elbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202211	I would just like to say many, many thanks for the opening-up to discussion that the rapporteur is bringing here. And I fully agree with the analysis that what made the difference was the way China went in and in less than two years totally changed Hong Kong's democratic structure. After all, the rapporteur himself has given vivid descriptions of the consequences: closing the media, arresting elected politicians, persecution of activists, etc. etc. In this context, a national law on legal certainty has also been implemented, which is now affecting not only people in Hong Kong, but also people inside China and around the world. That is why there is a real need to say: what is the position of us, and what are the consequences of the policy we are pursuing? So I just want to give the Cadeau to open up that debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202317	Here you go, sir. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202318	Yeah, you too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202327	Then there are no more brief comments. And then we should welcome the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party. It's sir. Marcus Knuth. And thank you to Enhedslisten's rapporteur for just fixing the podium. There you go. Five minutes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202338	Thank you. I would also like to begin by thanking Mr Seligman. Søren Søndergaard for a very strong speech and some very good historical reflections. It's not every day I can follow Enhedslisten as far as I could in that speech. I was delighted to listen to it. And then I'm very pleased that Mr. Uffe Elbæk has raised this debate. After all, we have a good colleague in my own party who has then been under pressure from China along with Mr. Uffe Elbæk. And if I may add to Mr. Søren Søndergaard: I visited Hong Kong when it was still British, and compared to Hong Kong today, democracy is certainly not the first word I think of when you look at the developments that have taken place in Hong Kong. That is why I am very pleased that all parties are united in this matter, because we need to stand together, not only as parties here in the Folketing, but also in the European Union. And, as we write directly in the text of the adoption, the reactions from China to Lithuania, yes, we use the wording disproportionately and unacceptable, I would say that it is at least very diplomatically formulated, because the pressure that China is putting on a small country like Lithuania, both directly and indirectly, both diplomatically and economically, is just very, very violent. So, on the Conservative side, we are pleased that the European Union has brought China's action to the WTO and also welcome the fact that the Foreign Minister has taken the matter up directly with the Chinese Foreign Minister, because this requires us all, both here in the Folketing and also in EU countries, to say very clearly what we think. That does not, of course, change the fact that in general we want that, I think we are all doing a constructive and good cooperation with both China and Taiwan, and we hope for that too, of course. And with those words, we can support the text of the adoption which was read out by the Social Democrat rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202547	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There are no brief comments. Then we should welcome the rapporteur of the DF. Here you go, sir. Søren Espersen. It's five minutes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329202609	I therefore believe that yesterday's publication of another Tibet Commission report has also updated this debate further. After all, the report shows what many of us had no doubt in advance about, namely that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in close cooperation with PET and the police as such, had an implied understanding for years that high-ranking Chinese guests should not be bothered by fully legitimate demonstrations, whether it was with Taiwan flag, Tibetan flag or Hong Kong flag, or whatever. It is good for the Danish people's government that the responsibility is no longer laid on the shoulders of a couple of good, decent policemen. Of course, because in this country we know that the police are not conducting foreign policy, but they are doing what they are told. In this and other similar cases one has the feeling that the Chinese did not actually have to demand anything at all in relation to being spared from inappropriate flags for once. The Chinese knew that this case was going to be settled by the Foreign Ministry. And otherwise the Chinese embassy will be short of any pointed fingers or hidden threats. Now it is Lithuania that gets with the crib in relation to the offending communists. Happily, it is as if everyone is now fully aware of what is going on, and I also think that we have gone further in this way. Something might suggest that we in Denmark are beginning to understand it after China has been sophisticated and smart for many years with our country. We made sure that not a single visiting Communist leader felt offended by anything at all. We puffed aside the Taiwanese, Tibetans and Falun Gong so that the visitor would not have to be confronted with various T-shirts and banners. But the special thing was that no matter how many institutions we in Denmark made us, and no matter how much we actually bent over all the years, China didn't even say thank you. The effective political harassment against Denmark continues unbroken. As has been discussed here in the past, it is called on the Chinese side to enforce the etkina policy. Then, we think, we do so with the most intolerable arrogance. In fact, China interprets etkina policy in such a way that if Denmark has both the official Denmark and the private bodies in any way possible, it will preside over itself to, for example, Denmark. As much as talking to or meeting representatives of the oppressed peoples of Tibet or Taiwanese representatives, China is furious and threatening. We know that in 2009 it was destroying everything for Danish export companies that the then Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen had received the Dalai Lama for a conversation at Marienborg. At that time there were 40 export companies who approached the Foreign Minister, Per Stig Møller, and complained about their distress. Everything with Denmark seemed to have stalled. The containers were forgotten on the dock. No new licenses were granted. Harassment. China complied on the surface with all WTO rules, because the Chinese never leave any clue when they threaten or harass, be it Danish business or official Denmark. They know how it went. As soon as China had got the Danish government to send a verbal note with exactly the text that China demanded, it ran again for Danish exports, and everything was as before the Dalai Lama's visit. Note, moreover, that when China threatens, it always happens by telephone call. China never threatens in e-mails or letters, so they never leave behind. That's how they operate all over the world. It's normal routine. With sophisticated cynicism, the regime understands to threaten and harass without really being seen anywhere. The time is not right now, but I know a lot of examples of how China has harassed and threatened Denmark without it in any way becoming official. Several of these things I have experienced myself. As I said, the Danish People's Party is behind the broad proposal for adoption, and I thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329203037	Thank you very much for the rapporteur's speech. There are no brief comments. And then I do not see any more rapporteurs in the Chamber. If the Minister wants to come up again, then that is possible. No, we're gonna stop here. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. The vote on the proposed adoption will take place, as I said, on Thursday 31 March 2022.
ParlaMint-DK_20220329203115	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Wednesday 30 March 2020, at 12.00 p.m. 13.00.
