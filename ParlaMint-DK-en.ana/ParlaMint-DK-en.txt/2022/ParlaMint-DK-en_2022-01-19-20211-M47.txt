F 27 (What can the Minister state about the state of the negotiations under way on the Public Procurement Act, and how will the government ensure that citizens are given greater insight into public administration and that the challenges identified in the Public Procurement Act are addressed?). The titles of the notified cases will appear in Parliamentstidende.dk (cf. above).
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130038	We start with questions to the Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for the Elderly. The questioner's first, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130048	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130050	Thank you, President. What will the Minister do in connection with the study that shows that in Denmark a partner killing is committed about once a month, especially against women, and what does the Minister intend to do to stop partner violence like the one that Louise Thagaard has told about to TV 2, where her ex-girlfriend was only given 7 years in prison for in front of their son to stab her 11 times with a knife and then toss her 6.5 meters down from the balcony of the apartment?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130127	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130129	Thank you for the question, which, of course, has a very serious background. We must, although it is not nice, face up to and acknowledge as a society that here in Denmark too many women pay the ultimate price for living with a violent partner and end up in the tragic statistics of partner killings. I do not think that we can and should not accept that as a society, and I am very concerned about what we can do to minimise the number of partner killings; we should be able to avoid them altogether. A partner killing rarely occurs out of the blue, but is most often the culmination of a longer period of control and violence, both psychologically and physically. This also means that we can do something to prevent it from ending up with killing, that is, because it does not come out of the blue, and that is why the fight against partner killing, the fight against partner violence and prevention are very closely linked. That is why I am also pleased that we, along with the Finance Bill parties and also with the author's party in the reserve agreement, have lifted this area. We've been doing this in every reserve deal since we got here. Among other things: We have provided permanent funding for outpatient services, that is, where you do not seek a shelter, but where you can get help outpatients; we have introduced free psychological assistance for women in shelters; we have set aside nearly 100 extra places; we have set aside money to extend the intervention model, which I think is quite important, and which is cooperation between the police, the municipalities and a specialised treatment offer which ensures help, both for the victim of violence, but also for the victim of violence. And here I think we have a very central point, because if we are to get rid of partner killings, we need to be much better at both tracking down and getting hold of those who live with violence, in time it is very taboo, and it also happens too often that women do not admit to themselves how dangerous what they live in is, but we also need to get hold of the perpetrators and stop the spiral of violence. Too many of them grew up with violence themselves. That is why this was one of our priorities in last year's reserve agreement. My time runs from me, but I look forward very much to the further lines in this very important area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130332	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130333	First of all, I would like to thank you, and above all for the fact that, together with the Danish People's Party, I know that our rapporteur is sitting down here behind us, he has secured more funds for the area. It is clear that this is absolutely crucial. However, as the Minister says, it is precisely for many people a taboo area and perhaps also an area filled with shame, where you do not want to go out and tell your friends, your family, your colleagues or to the educators down in the children's kindergarten that you have a violent partner, and that is why it is not certain that the money is doing it alone. I think we need to focus much more on getting the information out to those women, in particular, who are trapped in a violent relationship. I can say that, for my part, I experienced it a few years ago, when at least one of the things that kept my sister in a violent relationship was that she simply did not know how she would be dealt with with her lease. In other words, can we not be more open-minded about such practical things that might prevent women from getting out of a violent relationship and that information should at least be there? After all, we have heartfelt organizations like the Danner Foundation and the Joan-Sisters and others who are out there, but who may not quite get the support to get in touch with the women who are trapped in these conditions that they need to have, and that is also in relation to how we communicate across authorities and across municipalities. So I think we can get better there, and when I have brought the Minister for Social Affairs here for Question Time today, it is because we had an opportunity to discuss it here a year ago, and in any case I remember that the Minister gave an undertaking that something should be done not only in the economic field but also in the context of getting authorities and groups around society to talk better together. I just cannot hear that so much has happened and that is why I would like to hear whether the Minister will say anything about it, and I would just like to say in his defence that the clock is not ticking here, so I have no idea where I am. But I just want to end with regard to the level of punishment in the case we are experiencing here, Louise Thagaard's case, where her partner gets 7 years in prison for stabbing her 11 times and throwing her off the balcony in front of their son, saying that this is a ridiculously low punishment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130554	I'm sorry, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, and it is true that from up here we also find that the clock is not working, but it is up here, and I explain to the audience that it is the case that a minister is asked a very specific question during Question Time, and that the questioner and the Minister only have two minutes, and then we move on to a couple of laps with 1⁄2 minutes. And I will, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, try to conduct it just as quietly, and I know that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt can fill the time. That's what it used to be. But now we have come to 1⁄2 minutes, and here we are for an answer to the Minister of the Interior.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130626	Yes, for once in your life, you can be legally excused for not being in control of time! I can't. There's a watch ticking here with me. But also thank you for that night on that TV show. I do not think it can be overestimated how much it means that someone stands up and tells those stories, and I myself have had the opportunity to meet Louise in connection with a TV performance, and she also describes herself how, after every time she gets up, she gets a lot of inquiries from women who get to know: I am actually in a dangerous situation, and this can end really, really, really dangerous if I don't get broken with this relationship. That is why there is something in relation to the broad information, but since we were on television together, we also have part of the agreement we made, among other things. with the Danish People's Party, priority means for those professionals who may encounter these women health professionals, police, municipal employees to gain an increased knowledge of violence. Because that's what you need to be able to spot these women.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130712	Thank you. This is how the Minister's watch works, I understand. Here you go, sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130716	That is absolutely right, and that is also good. But then we also have to make it work. Obviously things take time. I understand that. But we do not have much time, I would say, when we know that in recent years at least one woman has been murdered by her partner, about once a month. That's why I might just be a little impatient to make this work. Then I would like to ask you in relation to the last one that I have mentioned, that is, the level of punishment that the Minister may be able to discuss in his next round, I know that the Minister is not the Minister of Justice in 7 years' time, where you may have to sit 4 or 5 years, because this atrocity is not an insult to the women it is going to suffer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130758	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130758-2	Thank you. Well, I fully share the impatience of the questioner, and that is why the issue of violence has also been a priority for this government in all financial law agreements, including the reserve, and most recently the agreement which, among other things, has been. allocates funds to strengthen local authorities' and front actors' knowledge of violence, for it takes something to be mocked, even if a woman does not acknowledge or admit it herself or is perhaps threatened not to be open about what is going on behind the four walls of the home. This is extremely important. We must negotiate a new action plan against violence by the end of the year. I hope that the other parties will help to ensure that the fight against partner killings is one of the key priorities of that plan.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130835	Thank you. Sir. Morten Messerschmidt with his last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130835-2	I can certainly say that, I think, on behalf of my party, is something that we would very much like to be included in. These are extremely important matters, and it is important to deal with both the preventive and the seeking out, but also the punishment side. So I would just like to ask you to ensure that the Minister of Justice is also involved in those meetings, so that we are punished more severely in cases of partner violence.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130900	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130901	Well, I know this is also something that concerns my colleague, the Minister for Justice, who has a seat next to me. And if we go back to 15 December, an agreement was reached on the police and prosecutor's finances, where there were four concrete interventions that also focus on both partner killings and, to a large extent, violence, which in the vast majority of cases is the forerunner of ending up as tragic as it does in too many cases. with a police guarantee in cases of violence, with specialised teams for cases of violence in close relationships, a new further and further training offer in the police, etc. It's just to say that we're very concerned about this, even across the government.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119130940	Thank you. Thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmidt. And thank you to the Minister in the first place. But we will continue with the same minister. You can see if you can fix the clock down there, as it will make it a little easier. Is there a button that can be pressed? Well, we do it that way, Mrs Karina Adsbøl, that I stand up when you have to finish your speech. We're trying.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131015	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131016	Thank you for that, President. Does the Minister believe that it is reasonable that families who have been exposed to unfounded information which has cast doubt on their parental abilities cannot have the notifications deleted, even though it has been established that they are groundless, such as: in the cases of Fanø, which were elucidated in the documentary "Musthinked for Life', and the case of a family called for an interview with the municipality after a hunting trip?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131039	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131041	Thank you for the question. Basically, I believe that notifications are a crucial tool for individual municipalities to discover children and young people who are miserable and careless and need help and support. It is therefore also important to state that information is an expression of concern for the well-being and development of a child. It's not an accusation. And we know that in many cases one or more notifications have been made about children who end up getting community help because they need it. Therefore, it is also crucial that the municipalities respond to the notifications they receive. We must never end up where a concern for a child who actually needs help is not properly investigated by the municipality. Having said that, it is clear that a municipality should not proceed with a case if, according to the municipality's assessment, the concern in the notification is not justified. In these cases, the municipality must ensure that the case is closed and give the family clear information so that they know that the municipality does not proceed with the case. Of course, that's the way it's supposed to be. For a family should not go through long proceedings with the municipality if a concern raised is not real, but quite groundless. In addition to the genes for the individual family, it will also be a waste of the municipality's resources, which should instead be used and focused where there are children who need the community to help them. I recognise that the task of handling notifications in individual municipalities is not always straightforward. It can be quite complex, also for tanned and competent social workers. That is why I am also pleased that, in relation to the agreement on children, we have ensured that a partnership of key players in this area will look at what is of good experience in handling notifications so that municipalities can be better equipped for the task they have.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131224	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131224-2	Let me make it quite clear that this is not about whether you are for or against notifications. It is a question of making sure that no families are run over in relation to baseless notifications and harassing notifications. We have seen that, and we have seen it, and we have seen it in the case of the Jutland West Coast, precisely in relation to a boy who has been with his family in search. So I would like to ask the Minister: does the Minister think that it is reasonable that this family should be spotted in the system, in other words that it is still on the file, that a notification has been received when it is meaningless and it has nothing on it? How would the Minister himself feel? After all, we ourselves can be subject to harassment. A lot of people can. So there has to be a little balance in that, given how to ensure that the families who are exposed to unfounded notifications and harassment of information do not have a spot on the file. The Minister may answer that question, i.e. whether the Minister intends to take any initiatives in this regard, including in relation to guidelines. This family was summoned for a conversation at the municipality because of a picture posted on Facebook. Well, you have to see the proportions of this. So what does the Minister intend to do to ensure the legal certainty of families?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131347	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131348	Thank you. Well, in fact, I believe that it is a fundamental part of family legal certainty that one can look at a case, that there has been a notification which has proved to be unfounded and has therefore been laid down. It is, of course, a protection for families, even if they are subjected to repeated groundless notifications, that the case officers can see that there has been a pre-history of this. And again, information is not an accusation, and therefore it cannot be said that there is a stain, just as there can be a stain on a criminal record if you have been punished. It is therefore quite fundamental that you can see information about the case and that it is not deleted.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131421	Karina Adsbøl, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131422	I do not understand why the Minister cannot follow that many of these families feel that it is violent to be called to a meeting of the municipality because of a notification which has nothing at all on it. And you must also be able to see that when you go to school, professionals have an obligation, they have an increased obligation to notify, so you have to be able to see the proportions of this as well. That's why I don't think, if you ask these families, that they feel that their legal certainty is met when they still have to be registered with the municipality.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131501	Thank you. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131502	Thank you to the questioner. I think things are getting mixed up here. The one part of the discussion is about the importance of the security and protection of the citizen that things are noted in the case, so that, if there is a notification, you can look up and see. that this family has previously been the subject of a groundless notification which the municipality shut down because there was no cause for concern about the child's well-being. I think that is also a protection for the family, that is, that it should not be deleted, but is part of the history. As I have said, it will be possible to speak in a case involving harassment of information. The second part of the discussion is then about how well the municipalities are able to shut down the groundless notifications, and they must be able to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131538	Karina Adsbøl for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131539	I cannot quite understand the Minister's answer. In other words, the Minister has no intention of changing this system. The Minister simply believes that it is legal certainty for the parents that they are spotted in the state acts because of a notification that has nothing on them. After all, the minister knows that if there is a more anonymous notification then the next step will be that people will think that there might be something about the matter, and then the parents will be called to a meeting again, and then the school and other actors will have to be heard. I've been talking to some of these families, and they certainly don't feel that their legal certainty has been met.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131614	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131615	Now the rapporteur refers to several cases in which the municipalities concerned have regretted and acknowledged that they have acted incorrectly, so I do not think that this is a good idea of how it should be done in general out there. I do not know the latest case to which the questioner refers from all sides, but if you look only at it from the point of view of what the questioner refers to, then I would say that it may sound as if the municipality has made more of the information than was necessary in that case, and it is of course important that the municipalities handle the information properly, both when there is cause for concern for the child, but also in those cases where there is no.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131649	The question is over, but we will continue with questions to the Minister for Social Affairs and the elderly, and that remains with Mrs Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131659	Please read the next question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131707	Thank you. How does the Minister think it should be ensured that notifications are not used as harassment, and does the Minister think that the system is good enough as it is?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131710	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131713	Thank you. My clear starting point, as I said before, is that information is an expression of concern as to whether a child or a young person is miserable. That is why I believe that it would be incredibly rare for a teacher, a schoolteacher, a neighbour or others to make a notification to bother other citizens and not because they are genuinely concerned about the well-being and development of a child. Notifications are important tools that each municipality uses to find the children who are miserable and deprived of care and need help and support. It must be crucial that we can get these children and get them the right help. Having said that, I am in favour of the fact that a notification may well prove to have nothing on it. I don't think that can be avoided. And there may also be very few cases where notification is used as harassment, and that, of course, does not belong anywhere at all. Therefore, it is also so important that the individual municipality makes a concrete and individual assessment of each and every notification they receive so that they can find out whether or not to proceed with a case. And let us just bear in mind that, in order to be able to conclude at all whether a notification is unfounded, it requires the municipality to address the concerns of a child. I know this is difficult, and I mentioned this in an earlier reply. It's not always easy to make these assessments, and there's some grip that's better than others. That is why I am so pleased that in our joint agreement on the Children First we have ensured that a partnership of the key players in this area will look at what good experience there is in handling notifications so that the municipalities can be better dressed for the task.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131833	Karina Adsbøl, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131833-2	Well, the minister isn't answering the question. In other words, does the Minister think it is reasonable that the files should still be stained by the fact that a notification has been made? The minister knows the system. Why is it that you don't take care of the family's legal certainty and say there was nothing about that and then delete it? So I would like to know if the minister thinks it is reasonable that the family who had returned from a hunting trip abroad were called to interview the municipality on the basis of the family's Facebook listings that the son had shot an impala?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131905	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131906	After all, we cannot stand here and deal with a specific case, and neither the questioner nor I know any of the specific cases mentioned in the press from all sides. We know them from the angle that comes out in the press. And with that reservation, I would like to repeat what I said just now to the questioner, that is to say, that it seems to me that this town has made more of a notification. I also note that local policy has announced that it will be followed up. And that's what this is all about. If a notification is unfounded, the municipality should not spend more time on it. Time must be spent on those children who are being careless and who need community help.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131941	Karina Adsbøl, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119131941-2	Will the Minister change the law? Will the Minister help to change the law so that the legal certainty of these families is respected and so that it is not in their papers? I have asked that repeatedly, and so I expect the Minister to answer yes or no? Another thing the Minister said was that there are very few cases of harassment. I'd like a figure on that. Is that something on which the Minister has the facts, because unfortunately we see that it appears? We are also doing so in relation to divorce cases, and unfortunately this is also happening elsewhere. That is why we need to have a system where things are balanced.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132015	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132016	I have answered whether I want to change the law, and I will not, because it is also a protection for citizens that you can go back. It follows from our administrative legislation that as a municipality you have a duty to record the files of the cases and not just to throw them away. It is also a protection for the citizens who can say: Well there has been a prehistory of baseless information • As a municipality, you have assessed it yourself and this follows on from it. So it is also a protection for citizens; and it is not like a stain on the criminal record. A notification is not an indictment or a notification is a concern for a child. That is why I think we have the right legislation in this area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132050	Last question, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132051	I could use some empathy here, because how would the Minister feel if it were her own? We also need to put ourselves in the place of these families: there is a piece of information that is groundless; there are anonymous notifications that are groundless. And it will still remain in the system, even if it was groundless. Then we know that there may be harassment. There may be a new notification, and then the whole mill starts and they don't get cleaned. For there will be a touch of that there might be something about that notification there. So I just have to conclude that the Minister will not comply with the legal certainty of families in relation to unfounded notifications.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132128	Thank you. Then it's the minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132130	It is a protection for citizens that the municipalities cannot simply delete the file, but that the file must be kept. Then, of course, the municipalities must have a strong professionalism, and surely there should not be a social worker saying: uh, I probably have some sense or other if it has been decided that a notification was groundless. That is what has to be documented in the case, that is to say that there has been a groundless notification. The second has nothing to do with a social professionalism, that is to say, that one might think one thing or the other. I have to say that when we look at the children who receive help, where there has been a lack of care, there are notifications ahead of time and often also many notifications. So it's an important tool for us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132204	The question is over. Thank you to Karina Adsbøl and thank you to the Minister. Let's move on. The next question is to the tax minister by Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen. And I have to say to Mr. Knox. Michael Aastrup Jensen, that it is so that the timing at the table does not work; but until now we have been able to cope with it by being quietly standing up and then finishing the sentence you are doing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132222	Here you go for the reading of the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132224	Thank you for that, President. The question is this: does the Minister consider it reasonable to cancel a company's tax and VAT loans, etc. under the coronatide on the basis of an 8-year-old speeding fee for an offence committed by the company's director, when the offence occurred before the company's establishment and without affecting the company's operation and management?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132244	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132246	Thank you for the question. I am very pleased to be able to answer this question. In concrete terms, it is being asked whether it is reasonable that an eight-year-old speeding ticket could lead to exclusion from the loan arrangements. Let me just make it clear: a company is not excluded from the loan arrangements on the basis of speeding tickets, whether the fine is granted by a policeman on the spot or by a judge in court, as a speeding offence is not a violation of tax law. Here, with a broad majority in the Folketing, we have given a historically helping hand to Danish business, Danish companies. In the field of taxation alone, we have provided opportunities for various forms of liquidity for 600 billion. kr. We have given 53,000 companies the opportunity, without any credit rating whatsoever, to obtain billion-dollar interest-free loans. It is a huge effort which has allowed more than 107,000 companies to be approved for loans and credits within 12 business days. The prerequisites for this were very clearly outlined in the bill, for which the author's party also voted, but it is just important to stress here that a company is not excluded from these loan arrangements on the basis of speeding tickets, whether the fine is, if you like, barred out of a policeman or whether it is settled by a judge, precisely because a speeding offence is not a violation of tax legislation. It's just to make it absolutely clear.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132420	Michael Aastrup Jensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132421	Thank you, Minister. The situation is, of course, that it is a matter which comes from, among other things. Randers, where there is a local company, which has also been reproduced in Berlingske over several pages on 15 November 2021, where this case is being clarified. Here it is clear to everyone, including the Danish Industry and a large number of politicians, that the situation, the example of being able to get a "no" on the basis of having been judged here, is wrong. Now the Minister says that neither can one, but then something has happened in this particular case, which seems very, very mysterious to me. Because the Minister did not go into this particular matter and said that there is something else behind it. On the contrary, the Minister says: we have to look at that; we have to talk about that. And then there has been no follow-up. So what the minister is now bringing here today is that an 8-year-old sentence with a fine of approx. 1,000 kroner, which is actually what the director has been told was the reason why he could not get corona help for his business is that then it is not true, but that it is actually for another reason. Why on earth didn't the Minister go out on the basis of the very spectacular story that was on the front page of Berlingske Business and went over several pages and has since then been running around in various other media too, and got clarity about this? The most important thing is that we help the company in question here, that we also help similar companies, which Danish Industry has proven there are many more examples of. I am therefore very pleased if the Minister says that this is not true, but then we must have some action to resolve the problem of these corona aid packages for similar companies, which a large majority of Parliament's parties support, including the Left. But the idea is also, of course, that this money should come out, not that it should be some small incident in the past with a director or a board member who, so to speak, stops it. So I hope that this is something that we can move forward on, and I really hope and believe that the Minister also believes that eight-year-old petty judgments should not be able to stop very much.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132618	Thank you. I would say that the Minister for Taxation does not have to ask for the floor, because I will automatically ensure that we have the floor during these Question Times. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132624	Thank you for the services of the President. There is a reason why, as a tax minister, we never give our opinion on specific matters, and it is because it is written in the legislation that we must not do so. That is why it is quite simple, and that is why I am not speaking about this. I say what is happening here, and we have been asked about speeding tickets, and I am told how I have been told about speeding tickets. At the time when we approved these aid packages, which have, overall, provided liquidity for nearly 600 billion. kr., was a very, very large part of the interest-free loan, and the criteria stand sharp in the legislation which the author's party has also supported.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132706	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132708	But we all agree that it's a good idea for us to give this help. We all are, of course, but we do not agree on it if there is something in your past of such marginal importance that should stop it, and that is what we need to get to the heart of. I can hear that the Minister does not want to go into detail here in the Parliamentary Chamber and fully respect it, but then we will have to work on it in some way, because the most important thing for me is that companies like that, for example. This in Randers and other companies is not being stopped.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132737	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132738	Well, that's fair. We have also had meetings in the contract circle, where the author's party has also taken part in a briefing on the situation with regard to these loan arrangements. The positive aspect is, I think, that we have succeeded in adopting together, in broad agreement, a way in which more than 107 000 companies within 12 business days • it is very fast if you look at what has been of other loan schemes • could also get interest-free loans for a very, very large amount of billions, and I think that is important to stick to that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132812	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, final question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132813	I actually interpret it positively if we are to conclude on such a positive point that the Minister is prepared that we go ahead with the matter and try to see if we can find another kind of solution. For me, it is at least important that companies with so many jobs are not stopped by someone, we have to say marginal things from the past by a board of directors or director. So I look forward to further dialogue. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132839	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132839-2	I always answer questions, as the questioner knows very well, but it is also clear that I also have to be quite clear that I cannot interfere in specific cases. You're welcome to ask a question. I would say, however, that if you read closely what the legislation says, you can see what the terms of these loans are. But as I said, speeding tickets are not part of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132858	Thank you, sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, and thank the Minister. The question is over and we move on to questions to the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply of Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll. And Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll, the clock does not work, but I stand up and you can finish your sentence.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132915	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132916	Thank you. The question to the Minister is: what will the Minister do to ensure that the problems surrounding the Hesselø Sea Wind Farm do not delay the green conversion?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132929	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119132930	Thank you for the question, and thank you for the good cooperation, not just with the questioner, but with the entire conciliation circle in general, in relation to the various extensions of renewable energy as a result of the agreement we made on the previous year. It is clear that the fact that we have been running on a potential problem around Hesselø, because the bottom conditions are not as we had hoped, means that we have now started screening for other alternative locations. This may, of course, mean that there may be a slight delay, but common to all alternative locations that we screen is that they will be deemed fully operational by 2030 at the latest. But it is clear that the whole process is, of course, one that I regularly share information about with the conciliation circle, and the decisions that had to be taken are of course in your hands.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133036	Mrs. Katarina Ammitzbøll, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133037	Thank you. After all, the green transition is a matter of urgency, and we also see that the challenges of scarce green energy are also reflected in very high energy prices for the Danes right now. After all, we are behind the Energy Agreement in 2018, and the agreement of last year states that we must be self-sufficient in green energy by 2030. Hesselø is difficult. It should be in operation by 2027 and, with what I hear the Minister say, my question will then be whether we should expect Hesselø to be delayed for three years. These are difficult bottom conditions at Hesselø, but fisheries must also be taken into account. Does the Minister not consider it appropriate to find an alternative location for Hesselø?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133126	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133127	Now it has not finally been clarified yet whether we can place it where we have decided to place it together in the first place, but, as I have said, we have undertaken with due care to examine for alternatives so that, if the original location cannot work, we can use another one. Let me say more generally, yet according to what the questioner has said about our ambition level in Denmark in the case of 2025 and 2030, that we are going to roughly quadruple our offshore wind turbine capacity with the latest decisions we have taken.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133203	Thank you. Mrs. Katarina Ammitzbøll, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133205	What the Minister is saying here about our level of ambition is of course very important. We have high ambitions, but we also have great challenges. We can see that offshore wind farms are one of the hardest and the most expensive to establish. Hesselø has come into trouble, including Omø South, and the energy islands will probably not be put into effect until after 2030. Bornholm we then focus on now. We have a huge energy shortage of maybe 10 GW. We produce 1.7 GW as it stands now with the established parks. Does the Minister consider that this level of ambition is now in keeping with the preliminary plans?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133248	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133249	Yes, from the questioner asked the question, until I answer now, we are in fact better off, because it is not 1.7, but 2.3 GW that we now have of offshore wind turbine capacity. Of course, that has been said in jokes and I am quite sure that the questioner is well aware of it. But that says something about how fast things are going in these years. We have 2.3 GW total offshore wind power today, and that's a lot, but despite the fact that it's a lot, we're going to quadruple it by 2030, and on the other side of 2030 we've planned an additional 10 GW.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133323	Katarina Ammitzbøll for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133325	Thank you. I think that when it blows and the sun shines on a good day like Monday, we are up to 4.6 GW in total, but we must at least triple it, so we get higher if we are to make power-to-x etc. What is the Minister going to do to ensure that these offshore wind farms are going to run on track and that an approved feasibility study, for example? I am thinking here of Omø South but also that we do not promise too much when we do not know the bottom conditions? There's going to be all these unseen factors all the time. What is the Minister's view that you may need to do differently to be safer?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133359	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133400	A little has been said about apples and pears. Well, the Omø Syd project is an open door project, and therefore, of course, there are quite different rules there. The risk involved is, of course, one that has been borne by nature, whereas in the offshore wind turbine projects we are talking about here, the feasibility studies and the work associated with them are something for which we have joint responsibility. It is clear, of course, that I have a special responsibility as Minister for the region and the authorities, but fortunately this is something that we are working very closely together in the conciliation circle. And I can promise that here, because I intend to do so, that we will also do so together in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133435	Thank you. The question is closed, so thank you to Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll. The next question remains for the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply, but now it is Mrs Signe Munk, SF who is asking, and the questioner is Mr. Rasmus Nordqvist, SF. I'll tell Mrs. Signe Munk and Mr. Signe Munk. Rasmus Nordqvist said the clock doesn't work, but so far we've managed to get up, and then you quietly finish the sentence you're doing. And I'm sure it'll work out this time too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133457	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133458	That's what we're counting on. What does the Minister intend to do to stop routine flaring from Total and other energy companies in the North Sea?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133508	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133509	Let me start by stressing that it is, of course, totally unacceptable to burn off natural gas, if it is not something that is being done as a necessary part of some security measures, then perhaps there is reason for it. Therefore, I also think that the examples that have been highlighted in various media coverage of this seem very strange, and I have asked the Danish Energy Agency to have a dialogue with Total to find a solution to this, so that we can stop it. We are also examining whether there is a need to ensure clearer rules.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133551	Mrs. Signe Munk, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133552	It is quite right, as the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply says, that the matter of routine flaring from among other things. the huge multinational black company Total has come up in EnergiWatch, which has sought access to correspondence between the Danish Energy Agency and Total. And the Minister was on the spot in EnergiWatch and said to quote: "It is, of course, unacceptable to burn off natural gas if it is not a necessary safeguard measure. And I hear the Minister repeat that too now. But if it is up to believers, then the logical outcome must be that the Minister is ready for a total ban on routine flaring, that is to say the burning of natural gas, which we see has nothing to do with safety measures. So what is the Minister's position on a ban on routine flaring?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133647	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133648	As I stressed both in the article referred to and in my first answer, which I will now repeat for the third time, I am clearly against such routine burning. And now we have the problem highlighted and seen how much dialogue can do and, in addition, we are looking at whether anything is needed anyway. Even if we can deal with the problem of dialogue, it may well be that there is a need for regulatory changes to prevent such a thing from happening again. So I agree with the ambition that this problem should be resolved.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133721	Mrs. Signe Munk, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133722	Totally has a concession approval which sets the framework for their operation in the North Sea. And from the dialogue between the Danish Energy Agency and Total you can see it shows the access to documents from EnergiWatch that Total is moving outside the concession authorisation they have, i.e. they are violating the agreement that is. I have every confidence in dialogue, but I am surprised that the Minister will go as far for a mastodont like Total. But I need to know if the Minister has been aware of this routine flare before it has been published in EnergiWatch.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133802	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133803	I was not aware of the problem, and I also have to arrest that I had to pay particular attention to some companies; I certainly do not. On the contrary, it must be said that when I am confronted with the problem, I say that we must do something about it. And I'm willing not only to look at it, but also to change the rules if necessary. I guess it's hard to find a much more offensive approach to such a problem with a minister, I think.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133826	Then it's the co-questioner, sir. Rasmus Nordqvist. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133827	Thank you. Now it's not a whole new case. I remember that a few years ago it was also up where we saw that in Denmark the gas was vaporized, and you didn't have to do it in Norway, as everything else is a corresponding geographical area. And the Minister is advocating that we should now have a dialogue. However, I do not believe very much that we should have a dialogue again. So I would like to hear: when you look at both section 10 of the underground law, which says that exploration and extraction must take place in a proper and appropriate way, so that waste of raw materials is prevented, and section 15 that the Minister can make changes to companies' production plans, whose overriding social considerations require this, is it really not muscle enough to be able to go in and say that then it is stop?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133916	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133917	I welcome the commitment and certainly also the motives behind the way the question is being put, but I think that if we were to sit across from each other and have such a general debate, the questioner would agree with me that if someone is accused of doing something that is contrary to the rules, in an article, no matter how useful and good a news media it might be, it is probably a very good idea to ask them what is up and down before taking action. Having said that, I have already stressed on several occasions that we are going to do something about this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133951	Sir. Rasmus Nordqvist, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119133952	Well, when there's an enthusiasm or whatever the minister calls it, it's because this isn't a new case. It was up to you three years ago. We can then see that this company just chooses to drive on, and then I get outraged that we allow it. But I'm glad to hear that you want to act. How long will we wait for this dialogue to take place before making rules that we have in other countries, which, of course, set clear limits on how to produce gas?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134022	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134023	Yes, it is clear, and I also think it is an aggravating circumstance, if it is true, as it has been produced, that it is the very same case that has just gone on. I cannot give a precise date, but I can say that we are working as quickly as possible to clarify these things. It has to be said that this is not just about the dialogue with the company, it is also about the fact that I have been informed by my official work that this is quite complicated, purely regulatory, in relation to EU legislation and other matters. It is not an argument for not doing anything, it is just an argument for the fact that it is probably a little important that we are just being prepared.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134055	Mrs Signe Munk for the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134055-2	In relation to the minister's action box, a clear message must at least be given from this: in Norway you have a ban on routine flaring, and we would suggest that you copy it here in Denmark and then we are past all the technicalities. We can expect the Minister to come up with concrete initiatives for action when we meet at the conciliation meeting, which has after all been convened by other parties here in the Folketing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134127	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134129	Yeah.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134132	The question is over. Thank you to Mrs. Signe Munk and Mr. Rasmus Nordqvist. We will continue with a question to the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply from Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, and Mr. Morten Messerschmidt knows the problem of timing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134141	Here you go for the reading of the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134142	Thank you for that, thank you to the Minister for coming forward. What is the Minister's position on spending the money that the state saves on the high electricity taxes, because then no aid should be given to renewable energy production, on reducing electricity and heating bills for Danes • especially for pensioners and low-paid people hit hard by the high prices?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134203	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134205	I must begin by agreeing with what must, as it were, be the premise for the issue, that is to say that we are concerned about rising prices. We are now looking at this and also thanking the questioner for coming yesterday to the discussions we had in the Ministry about it. If you can't make that clear link between the money saved and what you might be able to spend, then that is because the way you finance this VE aid is just about to get into the respective financial laws, and the money is then spent on what you use a budget law for; therefore, it is already spent, just like the years when it goes the opposite way and there is a need for more money, then you also find the money in the Finance Act. All of this isn't an argument for us not being able to spend money. We can do that, but it's just not the specific crowns and ears because they're already at their disposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134301	Morten Messerschmidt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134301-2	That is what I would like to learn a little bit more from, and I think that is a wish I share with many, because I can see that this is something that is being discussed in the public debate. In other words, the figure that has been put forward is that we should save 2.7 billion. kr., because the electricity price is currently so high that one simply does not have to give support. And it is good news in itself that we should not give aid; it is so bad news that it is the consumer who is being punished and indeed the companies as well. Then the Minister says, as I hear it, that you cannot just take the 2.7 billion, because it may be that we will have to use them later when the electricity price is low, because then suddenly there is a need for support. If that's the case, I can see that the minister is shaking his head... then I just want to know if you can't just look a little forward in time. In other words, some of the calculations I have seen about what is expected of the gas price and electricity price etc. In the coming years, unfortunately, we are not going to return to the low prices we have known last year or the year before, but rather that prices will be somewhat higher over a period of time. And that must mean that at least a considerable proportion of the 2.7 billion. DKK set off on the Finance Act to support renewable energy, then remain unused. Therefore, I would like to know if the Minister can explain what money is available, at least if one is based on the price projection that the Danish Energy Agency is showing today. What is the amount if it is not 2.7 billion?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134424	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134424-2	No, but it is true that the pre-discounted money will have to be paid less this year and that is 2.7 billion. But I'm thinking that sir... Morten Messerschmidt knows the technique in this, since he has helped to make the agreements of which this is an implementation, from 2012 and 2018 respectively. That is why it is fair to ask anyway, because there could also be a public who cared about it. So, for the sake of the public, not to speak down to Mr. Morten Messerskommandt I will explain it again: It is such that when you make this kind of aid model, it is, in fact, the Treasury which then goes in and covers a deficit or makes a profit. You've made the models after it has to go pretty much straight up in the end.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134505	Morten Messerschmidt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134505-2	But does this mean that one has actually been sitting over in the Ministry of Finance or in the Danish Energy Agency and knew that we would have these explosive price increases, because then it is purely an act, when one hears at least some say that it has taken them by surprise. I think it has come as a surprise to many, at least to me, that in some places we can see 100, 200, 300 per cent increases in the electricity bill. But if it is something that has taken people by surprise, then it must also mean that they had expected a lower electricity price and thus a higher support requirement than what is needed today. And that is why, in relation to the prediction then made of the electricity price for 2022, 2023 and 2024, we must now be able to say that there will be money that is saved and that can therefore be returned to consumers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134545	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134545-2	No, I mean, the models of support that have been adopted and that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt himself has been involved in the adoption, after all, has been adopted as they are. If they are to be changed, it is a completely different story once again. But on the question of whether it could be predicted here, it is clear that it could not be crowned and ear-eared, but in the length of clogs it has been possible, and that is why, as early as October, we in the government actually pointed out that this would be a problem and we anticipated these increases. The increases have actually become even greater than we feared they would be.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134618	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt, final question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134620	But it wasn't in October that we organized and decided these levels that it's longer, that is, at a time when we hadn't predicted how bad things would go in relation to the very high electricity and heat prices. Therefore, I just have to insist that what was expected then, everything else equal, must have been that more public money had to be spent on supporting renewable energy and that the money now, with the greatest probability, should not be spent because we can see that the high level, like stabilising itself, is not as high as it is now, but higher than what was expected. Then the Minister will certainly not come to my attention and say that we will certainly have some of the 2.7 billion. kr. should we not use them to help some of the most affected?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134657	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134657-2	I understand that this may sound inconvenient and that as a political position it may be fair enough to say: well, there are some money saved somewhere; then we can use it somewhere else. It's just not reality, and it's just not the agreement that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt himself made. That is not the legislation and the support programme that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt himself made. It is not the same as not being able to say politically that I think we are in agreement on that. Now the next step is to find out exactly who should have how much and where to find the funding, because it is not here that you can find it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134735	Thank you for that, the question is over. Thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, and thank you to the Minister. Then we move on to the next question, and that is to the Minister for Health by Mrs Jane Heitmann, Left. And I would say to Mrs Jane Heitmann that it is the case that we do not have time; but until now we have been able to cope with it by standing up and then you end like the sentence you are doing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134752	Here you go for the reading of the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134754	Thank you for that, President. My question to the Minister for Health is this: when will the government present its proposal for a future 10-year plan for psychiatry?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134803	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119134804	Thank you very much for the question. I knew that the question would probably come today. I am here with the report, i.e. the academic presentation from our agencies, both the Danish Health Authority and the Danish Social Protection Agency, which are involved together with a great many other stakeholders. Now we have the technical presentation, and I have also seen, Mrs Jane Heitmann, as well as having welcomed it when she has spoken on it, and there are so many stakeholders and politicians who have. I'm working on it myself. When I say that's what I expected to come, it's actually because I've been trying to think about Christiansborg's preoccupation with the pace of reforms that must happen like this, like this and like this. It is not only thoughts that I have made, because the author and analyst Sigge Winther Nielsen have written a book about haste in reforms, and his point is that things have to be done thoroughly, and his analysis is that there are actually too many reforms in this Parliament, and he says that there is too much work at the front door, but not so much at the back door. In short, he means that there is simply a whole series of reforms which may have sounded good and have also looked good in the television newspaper, where a rapporteur has stood and conducted questions and said that we are getting started, and then we have got started, but it does not really survive the meeting with reality. Then it takes a few years, some time, and it only causes despair out there, and then you may have to make a new reform or make it up to you to a great extent and so on. That is why I have to say that we can have this debate every Wednesday, but we are going to do this work thoroughly and we are not going to do anything that will cause us to say in three years' time that it was haste and that it was not thorough enough. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135009	Jane Heitmann, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135010	Thank you, Minister, for your reply. The minister talks about front doors and back doors, but I actually thought that when I stood here today, I would kick in an open door. After all, as the Minister has just said, the Danish Health Authority has presented its technical proposal for a future 10-year plan for psychiatry, and this is a solid proposal which deserves praise. And you can make many relevant cuts in the presentation, but in particular a focus area has both my and the Left's attention: children and young people who are miserable have a mental vulnerability or a psychiatric diagnosis. Last week, Minister, we spoke here in Parliament about children as relatives, children who are overlooked when mother or father becomes seriously ill or dies, and those children and their families are hard-pressed, and they deserve a determined effort. In the Capital Region, the number of references to children and young psychiatry during corona has increased by 27 per cent. These are children with stress, anxiety, depression, OCD, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. This is serious, not only for children and young people, but also for families who are sorry, frustrated by the lack of help and the long waiting lists. They are worn out, and it is perfectly understandable because it is not easy for a family to make everyday life hang together, while a child has great mental challenges or distress challenges. They all deserve prompt help and targeted action so that families can return to their everyday lives. Both before the Danish Health Authority's technical presentation was presented and also after the presentation of the technical presentation on Monday, I held meetings and had a dialogue with a wide range of associations and professional companies and private individuals, and common to all of them is that they want action now. The Minister has already stated in a parliamentary reply that the thousands of children and young people who experience mother or father becoming seriously ill or dying must be given priority by preventive action and treatment in the next 10-year plan for psychiatry, and that is why my question to the Minister is this: when does the Minister call for political realism negotiations on a new 10-year plan for psychiatry?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135217	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135217-2	Thank you for that speech. It is written before I gave my answer, I can almost figure out, because there was no reflection on what I said here, and that was a little too bad. This government has given priority to psychiatry. In the very first Finance Act, we delivered a lasting boost of 600 million annually. kr., and you can go in and see in the budgets of the regions that in the psychiatric wards it has become a boost and a boost, it becomes a concrete development and a boost in the various parts of psychiatry. So we have already prioritised psychiatry on our first financial law.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135259	Thank you. Mrs. Jane Heitmann, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135259-2	Reflecting and reflecting... I am so surprised that the Minister has not reflected on my question, namely: when will the government come up with their proposal for a 10-year plan for psychiatry? The government went to the polls on a new ten-year plan for psychiatry, so it's not something that's suddenly popped up. I am surprised at the fact that we have waited two and a half years for the technical presentation that the Minister did not see now, so, as I said at the outset, I am not standing here and kicking in an open door, if I may say briefly to the thousands of children, young people and families that the
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135336	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135337	It may be because we have a different view of politics. If the questioner has finished reading this report from the Danish Health and Social Protection Agency and all the work that is, and if you in the Left have finished thinking about how we implement it in concrete policy, and if you have already finished it after a week and had conversations with people and everything else and have changed it into what a 10-year plan for psychiatry should look like political step by step, then I think you should have a conversation with mentioned Sigge Winther Nielsen and have a talk about how to actually make reforms that also hold up the meeting with reality and also stick to looking at it in 5 years' time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135420	Mrs Jane Heitmann, last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135421	I would also like to talk to the Minister's author about the challenges in psychiatry, and I think perhaps in reality that the Minister should try to send his thoughts back to Kim Larsen, who said: but then one day I went up to the minister and said: You there, get your feet straight down and take your hat off. Man, don't you see it's all going completely cucumber? And that is the case with psychiatry, and I take my hat off for the Minister to talk to writers and all sorts of others, but I think, if I am to be completely honest and with my hand on my heart, that what is needed out there is that the government is acting, that the minister is just looking from the fourth floor of the ministry and seeing what is needed out there for the thousands of children and young people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135501	Then it's the minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135501-2	Thank you. This government has just acted. As I mentioned in my previous reply, in our first Finance Act we have provided a durable kr. to our psychiatry, therefore, significantly more than what the previous government stood for. This is a significant step which is now being used for extensions, several sections of bed, etc. In addition, we have commissioned a detailed technical proposal to put up top, namely a 10-year plan for psychiatry. We may have a long talk, but I have to insist that it should be professionalism on which this is based, and that is the work that is happening now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135544	Thank you. Then the question is over. Thank you to Mrs Jane Heitmann and thank the Minister for Health. That means that we go further, but now it is to a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration, and that is by Mr. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party. Sir. Marcus Knuth, the timing doesn't work, but until now we've done it the way that when I get up, it's because time is running out, and then you finish the sentence you're doing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135602	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135604	I thought for a moment I had unlimited time, but I haven't. I'll keep it as short as I can, President. Does the Minister believe that it is an expression of good integration when two students receive 25,000 DKK. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135628	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135628-2	Thank you for the question. I guess the short answer is no. But I only know the case from an article in Jyllands-Posten, and I would like to mention, for the sake of good order, that the Equal Treatment Board and the rules in this area are the responsibility of the Minister for Employment and Gender Equality. But no one should be in any doubt about either my or the government's position in principle on this issue. Immigration from the countries around the Middle East has led to and still leads to cultural clash with Danish society, and society has too often turned off instead of standing firm. We can from Christiansborg make enough rules, but they are of no use unless we also stand firmly locally on the values that have been the mainstay of Danish society for many years. And it is a Danish value that you can greet each other by shaking hands regardless of gender, man as a woman, tall as low. This is the way we do things and have been doing things for many years. I have nothing to put off public institutions that take responsibility for themselves and insist that we treat people the same way. On the contrary, they deserve praise and they deserve support, especially those institutions that have a role to play in shaping our children. We must not only bring in democracy and equality with breast milk, we must be prepared to have it included in school milk. I do not think we should accept that a person will not shake hands with a person of the opposite sex. And the fact that we can still see examples of conflict is only proof that we are still standing at the beginning of the value struggle we have been talking about for some time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135757	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135757-2	Thank you. I welcome the Minister's approach, because what I fear here is that it is only the tip of the iceberg. If you are bored and want to be in a bad mood, you can go to the Equal Opportunities Board's website and see some of the cases that have been. Among other things: there was also a Muslim girl who complained to the mention about learning to dance lanciers at her high school, for that is where you have to hold hands. She didn't think she should. There are just repeated examples of failed integration going all the way down through our society, where people with a Muslim background, through an offended attitude, try to change Danish culture. Now the Minister is not the Minister for Gender Equality, but the Minister for Integration is aware of that, but this is a reflection of a failed integration over many years. I am well aware that this is like turning an oil tanker around, and I am well aware that the Minister does not have such a snapshot solution, but when the Minister sees these matters, what does the Minister for Integration intend to do overall to try and reverse this superthought?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135904	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135906	I think it is perhaps important to say at the outset that if you go to a large Muslim country, Turkey, for example, and shake hands with women, it is completely unproblematic. That is the way it is too far, the vast majority of Muslims in this world are completely unproblematic. So I see it as a small, very hard ideological core that is trying to push its own values one step forward and force Danish values one step back by insisting that you do not shake hands. And that is where I think it is just important for us to be told here in Parliament that this is not something we regard as a general problem with Muslim citizens. It is a small core that tries to push the equality back.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135945	Marcus Knuth, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119135946	Thank you. But unfortunately, there is a small nucleus, such as... use the Equal Treatment Board and receive the support of the Equal Treatment Board. I was glad to see that the Social Democratic Party was in the media saying that they really agreed with the school, but if I were at an ordinary school and this judgment had fallen on the Equal Opportunities Board, then I would be afraid of what I would do next time there are two Muslim trainees refusing to shake hands. Then you run the risk of suddenly spreading a standard in schools that you don't have to shake hands. So what, apart from saying that you support the school, will the Minister do in concrete terms to ensure that schools follow what the government says and not what the Equal Opportunities Board says?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140021	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140022	Perhaps I should start by saying that I do not know whether the school or the municipality in which the school is located has brought the case before the courts. I also understand that some of the legislation referred to is EU legislation. That does not mean that it cannot be changed, but it just means that it is not something that we can only change in this Chamber.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140043	Marcus Knuth, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140044	The irony lies in the fact that 9 out of the 11 members of the Equal Opportunities Board have actually been appointed by the Minister for Equal Opportunities, so perhaps we ourselves have been involved in creating this problem. Now, of course, I know they have to be politically objective, but it is strange if the majority of the Folketing, in the decision that has been taken, is on the side of the school and not on the side of these two people. But now we have called the Minister in consultation, so we have the opportunity to continue this dialogue, so I would actually just like to call on the Minister to perhaps also try to have a good and thorough talk with both the Minister for Gender Equality and the Minister for Education to ensure that what is being said in the media is right, too, that the school is going to follow forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140122	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140123	Thank you. Yes, I can see that the Minister for Gender Equality has been called in consultation, and I think that is very good, because then perhaps we can get a more detailed discussion. And what will certainly be my approach and that of the government is that the public institutions that we have must also defend the values of democracy and equality. We cannot regulate everything from here in detail, and that is why we need to insist that the specific school managers, day-care managers, managers of swimming halls, job centres and others should also bear the values of democracy in themselves and implement them in the concrete institution. And when they do, they must be backed up and not beaten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140157	The question is over. Thank you, sir. Marcus Knuth, and thank you to the Minister. Then we can move on to the final question, which is to the Minister for Education and Research, and that is by Mr. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl, Dansk Folkeparti. And to Mr. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl I would say that the timing does not work, but I get up when the time is up, and then you finish the sentence.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140215	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140217	Thank you. Does the Minister agree that there is a need for improvements in special educational support (SPS) for students with disabilities in higher education, including: in the light of the debate during the examination of the emergency law on SPS in June 2021?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140233	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140234	Thank you, sir. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl for the question. There must be good opportunities for students to participate in higher education on an equal footing with other students with disabilities. The special educational support is an essential part of this, and it is my impression that the SPS scheme is overall functioning. Since the debate on the emergency law in June 2021, to which reference is made in the question, I have sought the support of the rapporteurs in order to make temporary legislation permanent, so that students with disabilities in the future do not risk losing the right to support if they are still enrolled in their education. There is support for this, and in the near future we can put forward the necessary bill... I expect we can do that next month... and then we can create that security and clarification. The June debate specifically identified the challenges faced by processing times. In addition, the Board has stated that by 2020 the average processing time for the SPS applications, where the awards are based on a manual procedure, was 19 days. If automatic allocations are included, the average processing time in 2020 was as low as 7 days. I am concerned that together we are creating a better framework for students with disabilities, and I am therefore very pleased that my predecessor, in May 2021, concluded a good disability policy agreement with a broad majority in the Folketing, in which among other things. funds were allocated to an experiment with holistic study plans. I know that this is a matter of great concern to the rapporteur. I look forward to the joint collection of the agreement that will take place and the further discussion in February, to which the parties have been called, on how best to improve conditions for students with disabilities. We agree that this is important. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140424	The asker, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140425	Thank you for that and thank you for your answer. It is true that some things are going on, and I and the Danish People's Party are also very, very good. But after the debate we had back in June, when it was an emergency law, because there was an administration of the rules that did not follow the rules, and to ensure that the students actually received the help that we all agreed they should have, we naturally made the emergency law. We also support the amendment proposed by the Minister this autumn, which makes it permanent. However, what I really want to ask is that the debate in June mentioned a need to look at the SPS as such and look at other adjustments. At that time the minister then said: "All this exercise is precisely to say that what you have experienced as a student in recent years is also what we maintain to manage after in the coming period. We shall now have the legal basis for thanking you for that, but then we will also give our hands on the fact that when the temporary legal basis expires, we will sit together politically and find a lasting solution to this arrangement. And yes, it is my view that we are starting from what is in force today, but I do not want to anticipate the overall negotiations and the overall discussions on it. Because I can also hear that there are various rapporteurs who would like to carry in other things and have a broader discussion of it, and I think there should be room for that. In the autumn, when the Minister made the presentation for the permanent declaration, I also pointed out that we had this discussion. And the reaction from the Minister was that this is not intended to be included in the legislative proposal that we will be dealing with shortly. That is why I am calling for a little discussion: because when I hear from students that they find it difficult to be sure that they can get the help, from the start of the study, that they can be unsure whether they can take the help further from one education to another or between directions on the programme, then I need us to have the discussion on how to do this better. That is why I would like the Minister's answer as to when, when we do not put it into the legislation we are about to discuss, we will have the opportunity to deal with it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140630	Thank you. The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140630-2	I would like to say that I would very much like to enter into dialogue with the rapporteurs if there are some specific features of the scheme that can be improved. There will be an opportunity in February in connection with the follow-up to the disability policy agreement, where we can specifically address issues related to the subject here. We can do that, and I would just like to remind you that, when I announced the permanentisation of what we agree on in the legislative proposal under way, I made it clear that I did not rule out any further discussion on it. So I am happy to accept concrete examples or proposals and then we can discuss them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140711	Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140712	I am, of course, glad to hear that, but I still need to go one step further. For I have asked the Minister recently whether the Minister did not think there was a need for an evaluation of the SPS scheme in higher education at the same level as it was done in youth education. There the Minister replies so slightly weaver, but basically that there is no need for that. I think the problem is that when we do not know what works and what does not work, we need an evaluation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140746	Thank you. The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140748	As I said before, I would like to say that I would like to enter into a dialogue if there are specific proposals. The agency has the task and has been instructed to look continuously at how to improve the quality of the system and ensure that there is uniformity and high quality in the offers made. And if there is a need to look at something further or to prepare for the fact that you can take it with you to other training opportunities, too, if you first have been given support, then we would be happy to do so. I do not see the great political conflict here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140825	Thank you. Last question, please, sir. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140826	Then I would just like to ask whether we can agree that, when we are going to make the adjustment in the form of the amendment of the law, we will also have a guarantee that the students will be able to get the help that is needed from the first day of the study, if that requires starting the treatment before they are actually sure to be admitted because it will probably do so. But can we agree that the goal must be to ensure that the students have the help on the first day they start the study?
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140854	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140855	I am aware that this is one of the issues on which there has been some discussion, and let us have a discussion on it too. I would just like to point out that, in general terms, it has been possible to reduce the length of proceedings by a large measure to below the target figure that has been set for several years in a row. And there is also a new system in preparation by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Education, to further improve these procedures. Whether or not there are other issues, such as what has been mentioned here, we will discuss them together. Thank you for the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140930	The question is over. Thank you to Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl and to the Minister. That concludes Question Time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220119140937	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Thursday 20 January 2022, kl. 10:00. I refer to the agenda that will appear on the Danish Parliament's website.
