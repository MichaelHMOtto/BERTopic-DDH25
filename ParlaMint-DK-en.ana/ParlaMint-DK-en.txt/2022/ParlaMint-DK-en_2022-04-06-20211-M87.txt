At the same time, I should like to inform you that there has been a questioner, Per Larsen (KF), on question No. No. 8, no. 10 and No 12 to the Minister for Education and Research.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130141	The item listed as No. 2 on the agenda, can only be dealt with at this meeting with the agreement of the House. Are there any comments? It's a matter of course.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130159	Question No 1, by Mr McMahon 1 is for the Minister of Climate, Energy and Supply of Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130208	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130210	Thank you. The question is this: does the Minister think that it is satisfactory that heating aid can only be paid out in August?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130221	The question is a little imprecise, so allow me to start by saying a few words about how I interpret it. If heat help means the help of a pensioner, for example. can get to its heating bill, so it is not right that it can not be paid until August. Of course, it is paid, as always, through the processes that work there. Nothing has changed about that. It is actually even the case that if you have received a larger bill, you can apply to Payout Denmark and you can get a larger check. In addition, there will also be people who have acute problems in recovering their bills. It may be if you are on a transfer income, it may be early retirement or pensioners or something else. Then you can go down to the municipality and get help with it, and you can get it acutely. I think that what is perhaps referred to here is the hot-check agreement made with parties a little to the left of the author's party in the Folketing, and it is true that it can only be paid out in August. If I am not mistaken, it is the one referred to, and therefore I can answer: No, it is certainly not satisfactory. I wish I could press a button and then it was paid out tomorrow, but unfortunately it cannot be done for various technical reasons.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130345	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130346	But can it really be that it takes almost six months for this check to be paid out? I can't believe this. When we make decisions here in the Folketing that are not for the benefit of the citizens, it can happen quickly. We could close down an entire mink business in 44 minutes. Then things went well, even so fast, that there was no legal basis in place. Now we have to pay out a heat check on an approx. 6,000 kr. per the household at least the households that receive it and then it takes several months. I almost have the impression that it would be quicker if the Minister went down and raised the money in cash and then cycled around to all the households in Denmark. Then you could make it by August. Well, you gotta be able to do something. What has the Minister tried to do as responsible minister in this area to ensure a quick payment, and what is the reason why it should take so long?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130436	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130437	Now perhaps I should start by saying to those who may sit and keep up that the questioner is against this check, that is to say against giving 419,000 households a help of DKK 6,000. That is why I also take this whole sequence and I think it is also clear from the polemical tone of the questioner that it is more political teasing. And peace be with it now. I can assure you that of course no one has an interest in the fact that things are not going as fast as possible. These are target groups to which we have never paid money in this way in Denmark before. That means that first you have to identify who has the heat source it's about. Then you have to keep it against income base, of course, and it is a quite complicated process.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130521	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130522	But it's not political teasing. It is political sloppy, and it is political disagreements that make us not part of this agreement. However, one might wonder why it has to take so long to get a check paid to the citizens. Could it be that one of the reasons the Minister is actually a little concerned about the fact that it takes so long is that the most socialist solution has been chosen as possible, namely to make it as bureaucratic and hassle as possible, by saying that there are some groups of voters who should not have money; they should not have any help, especially those who already earn more than a certain amount of money. So we have set up such a minutely, who can get and who cannot get heat help, and that is what creates bureaucracy and trouble.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130558	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130559	In a sense, the questioner is right. It is clear that if you would just pay out widely to all Danes, as I think the questioner himself has suggested, by lowering some taxes instead, it would be a different kind of exercise. How fast this could go, I don't know. I haven't looked into it, because it hasn't been our purpose. We'd rather give the 419,000 households who need it the most, this help of 6,000 kroner, than we would lubricate a tax relief of a few hundred kroner spread throughout Denmark. I have to say, I'm a little puzzled that you call this sloppy. That's the opposite. On the contrary, it is a question of ensuring that the rules that exist are followed for data security, and that the questioner can stand and laugh a little; in fact, I think there are many people who think this is quite serious.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130649	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130651	I would really like to meet the Minister. It may not really be sloppy, it is such an overzealous zeal in that certain groups in Denmark are not allowed to get help, and that is what makes it take such an incredibly long time. I do not know how beneficial it is to help pay a heating bill in August, which is perhaps the hottest month of the year. The alternative could have been to reduce taxes and charges in general for all Danes, perhaps temporarily. It could work immediately, and it would benefit everyone, but instead it would charge a hell of a lot of taxes and taxes. There is inflation and energy prices are rising, and instead of just making the simple non-bureaucratic choice of lowering taxes and taxes, we are adding even more bureaucracy. Can't the Minister see that this is silly?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130725	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130727	No, I certainly can't. And that may also reflect the ideological position of the questioner and my position, because of course we do not think it would be fair to use tax dollars to pay for, for example. a heat check for a household with an income of 5 million. DKK 10 million kr. or 100 million kr. And that is what would be the consequence if we were to follow the model of the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130756	The question is closed. We thank both the questioner and the Minister. The next question is to the Minister of Transport of Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130810	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130811	Thank you, President. Does the Minister consider that Lynetteholmen is financially resting in itself and that it is in general an economically sustainable project?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130823	Thank you for the question and not least for the interest in Lynetteholmen. I do not think that the answer to the question comes as a great surprise to the questioner. We had a consultation on this last week, when I referred to the budget which has just been submitted by the City & Port, which has therefore approved an updated budget for the construction of the island, and from that budget it appears that the costs and revenues have both increased. City & Harbour continues to expect that the installation of Lynetteholmen can be financed by the income from the reception of land and the guarantee provided by the City of Copenhagen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130905	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406130906	My question was whether the construction of Lynetteholmen is self-financing, and that is quite fundamental because the parties behind the construction of Lynetteholmen have repeatedly sold the construction of Lynetteholmen as self-financing. In addition, the previous Minister for Transport, Benny Engelbrecht, refused even to be interviewed by B.T. before B.T. confirmed that it is self-financing. Now we are in a situation where, according to Berlingske, there is a budget overrun of 900 million. kr. the construction of Lynetteholmen and, at the same time, doubts are raised as to whether the funding is realistic. So the construction of Lynetteholmen seems to be becoming more expensive, while the funding seems uncertain. That is why I asked the women for both the SF and Radicals yesterday whether they would guarantee that Lynetteholmen runs around in itself. They wouldn't. You referred to the Minister of Transport. And the last time I asked the Minister of Transport if she would guarantee that Lynetteholmen is self-financing, she referred to City & Harbour's calculations. The Minister also promised at the conciliation that the parties would be called for a technical review of the economy of Lynetteholmen, and we have not yet heard any more of that. However, I would like to ask the Minister, not the City & Port, because it was politically sold, as if it were self-financing, whether the Minister can guarantee that this will be self-financing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131018	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131019	What I can do is to refer to the budget which has just been updated. And it is quite true that there are expected additional costs, but there are also expected additional revenues. It is against this background that City & Harbour says that their clear expectation remains that it can be financed by the income from the reception of land and the guarantee provided by the City of Copenhagen. In the meantime, as a minister, I have asked to stop clapping and to look into alternatives. It can be expected to have some effects on the economy, but we must come back to that when we know what the alternatives are, because we do not know that today it is being examined.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131107	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131108	However, the calculations in relation to funding have been made, on the basis that there will be as much construction and the provision of land in the future as there has been in the last few years, when we have had the largest building boom in Danish history. How can the Minister expect that there will be even more land in the future when it turns out that you can only account for the 6 million? t out of the 80 million. In the near future, will the project be running around at all? What is the position of the Minister that it looks as if there will be a shortage of land, because one cannot just expect that as much will be built in the future as has become under Denmark's largest building boom?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131147	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131149	So what I have been told is that there is a lot of surplus land in Copenhagen, and the problem we are currently facing is that there are 2 million. to soil, as at present is in an intermediate depot in Nordhavn and it is expected to contain 4 million. t land at the turn of the year 2022/23. And what is the challenge is: Where to make of that land? Should you drive it in trucks to the other end of the country, or where should you put it? And that's what Lynetteholmen is part of the solution, where you can deposit the land there. So information that there is not expected to be enough land, I am not in possession of at this time. However, if the questioner has any information that there is going to be a shortage of land, I would very much like to look at it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131237	Thank you. The questioner for the final question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131238	Thank you. My final question concerns the dumping of sludge in the Bay of Køge. Here, over 200,000 m3 of slightly contaminated sludge has been dumped, as it is called, from the excavation of Lynetteholmen. The next contracts for the excavation should have been put out on Monday, as far as I can see, but the offer seems to have stopped. Is that right, and if so, how can it be, and what does the Minister think about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131308	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131309	What I have, of course, had the support of the conciliation circle is to look at alternatives to what is called slap. This work is now under way and results are expected in the coming months. So what can be done with the sludge that should otherwise be dumped, and where can it alternatively be deposited? And I think that is an important job. I have had wishes, and that is why I have had the support of the conciliation circle to look at alternatives. We have to assess this and then we will come back when we have discussed the options available.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131346	Thank you. The question is closed. The next question is to the Minister for Culture by Charlotte Broman Mølbæk, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131404	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131405	Thank you. Will the Minister, as e-sport grows day by day as a phenomenon in Denmark, as more and more people use e-sport at all ages, as several organisations, public institutions and schools continuously discover e-sport as extremely beneficial in teaching, as is confirmed by studies from Esport Denmark, as e-sport offers enormous opportunities for young people and society as a whole, and as we should ensure that development is influenced by the community-oriented values on which the Danish idea of association is based, take steps to ensure that the inevitable development of e-sport is supported by the public sector so that we can anchor it in the concept of association by developing a national strategy for e-sport in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131452	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131455	Thank you for the question and for the opportunity to discuss e-sports here today. I personally have a great passion for and am also mostly rounded by the more physical sports and communities and also the communities that come with participation in society. At the same time, I can see and therefore share the questioner's assessment of developments. There are very many children, young people and adults who are concerned about e-sports, and with the development that we see, one can only imagine that it goes one way, and it is up. I believe that this development presents some challenges, but also some opportunities. On the one hand, there is a risk that the practitioners will have more screen time at home alone at the computer. This can mean that you move less, but it can also mean that you have less community and less interaction with friends. The hate speech we know from social media also takes place in the world of e-sports. This whole toxic speech or hateful speech hits especially girls and women, who unfortunately often experience sexist and discriminatory comments when playing. In the e-sport we also find doping, cheating and match fixing, and as a player you can also be cheated well and thoroughly in search of these unique decorations with weapons etc. Finally, in my optics, it is also a huge challenge that the game titles are owned by large international companies which determine the rules and conditions of the games. Thus, e-sport has not a democratically constructed basic structure, as we know it from the world of sport. On the other hand, e-sport also offers a lot of opportunities, as the e-sport takes place digitally and can therefore be grown by everyone on an equal footing regardless of gender, age and physical prerequisites. Fortunately, it is also the case that e-sport today is widely recognised and supported in Denmark, and I think it is crucial that we support that e-sport is grown under proper conditions in association life and not just at home alone behind the screen, and I think we should talk about that. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131706	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131707	Thank you for that and I share the Minister's many observations on e-sports. One thing is that e-sport is a firmly implemented part of a lot of children and young people and also adults' everyday life and leisure life, and in reality Denmark has also become quite the leader when it comes to e-sports we are actually really, really talented in this area, but it has a lot of times, and especially because we haven't gone into the field at all politically. It has been the commercial forces that have themselves been driven off, and then people have flowed there because they are good products on which they supply. It's something that's exciting, it's something that's funny, it's evolving, and it's a whole new universe that's really been going through a lot of years. When we talk about children and young people and communities, sitting alone and not sitting alone, we should also remember that we are not sitting alone, but that there are also quite strong communities inside e-sports. There are also communities around the e-sport, where you sit together, or you go out to different tournaments etc. So that way there is a lot of community in it. But there are also the pitfalls, as the Minister so well pointed out, and that is why I also think it is very important that we get on the ground politically so that we can support good development. There is no proper framework and conditions for how to provide e-sports today. There is no protection for children and young people, especially in relation to any of the hate speech to which the Minister also referred, and very many parents have no idea how to talk to their children about e-sports. So should we not try to get into this and say that we can give political support so that we support initiatives and good frameworks and involve parents, teachers and educators in e-sports so that we can actually help our children and young people well through it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131857	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131858	Thank you very much. I think that these are important and interesting considerations as regards the fact that we have something which, on the one hand, is used by many and, on the other hand, risks bringing with us some unfortunate things, especially for our children and young people, and which, of course, is easily concealed from parents too. So how we as a society go in and best support that it then happens in some framework, where we get as many of the positive effects of it without getting all the fighting in full bloom, I think we have a good framework for going further down. And the questioner's dedication to the subject also means that we are constantly discussing it here, and thank you for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131939	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406131941	I am glad that the Minister took note of this, because it is true that this is a subject for which we are very much in favour, and it is here, and it is here to a large extent. So what is missing is that we also come on the field politically in terms of supporting the good framework, guidelines and conditions that we know from Association Denmark. After all, we are world renowned for Association Denmark around and our strong support for local communities and the way we create a framework to be active together in leisure time. There I see a huge potential in relation to e-sports. Can the Minister see that too? And can the Minister also see that a national e-sport strategy can support this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132015	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132017	I can certainly see that this has come to stay and that we, as politicians, have a responsibility to go in and influence it. I would very much like to be a part of that. We have also supported it financially. After all, support can also consist in the recognition of work, and I think that we should go further down both tracks in relation to the political work that lies ahead of us, so that the basic values that I can hear from the questioner that we share, namely the positive effect of the power of association and the community around it, especially for our children and young people, fill as much as possible in the field of e-sport and not least possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132050	The questioner for the final question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132053	Thank you. It is true that one can note that we have delivered an amount and that it is a very low amount. But does the Minister not see that there is a huge potential in supporting it with a real amount that can come out and back it up? After all, hundreds of thousands of children and young people we are talking about are involved in this, so a few million kroner simply is not enough. Can the Minister not see that now we have to give it gas here and then make both a national strategy and also a real guarantee of a Association Denmark when it comes to e-sports?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132123	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132125	Again, I would say that I think there are some important framework for this, and there are some fundamental values in my pre-love for the community at all: being a member of a community, being brought together with other children and young people, for which e-sport has a potential, but which in its basic substance is not built in the same way as in our other association life. That is why there are other things at stake here, but it also requires some political answers. And I would like to acknowledge once again that the rapporteur is putting a great deal of effort into ensuring that we have a special look at our children and young people in particular in this matter.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132205	We thank the Minister and the questioner. The next question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration of Sikandar Siddique, Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132218	Please read the question
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132219	Thank you for the floor, President. Thank you, Minister, for coming. I will read out the question: when last week an Iranian woman was tried forcibly deported from Avnstrup, which ended in a violent use of force against the woman, who subsequently also committed self-harm, so that the deportation had to be interrupted and the woman admitted to the hospital, does the Minister have to reflect on whether the criteria for deportation or asylum should be changed when a person is willing to go so far to avoid deportation and thus stay in the Danish asylum hell that gives children ptsd?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132300	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132301	Thank you for the question. Every year there are thousands of foreigners who apply for residence in Denmark. A great many of them are granted a residence permit and the right to be here; others are refused or sentenced to expulsion, and they must of course leave the country after all we live in a state governed by the rule of law. When a refusal is granted or a judge decides to expel a foreigner and he or she must be sent by Denmark, the authorities will always be in dialogue with him or her prior to the deployment and try to get the person to leave voluntarily, and most actually do so. Here, too, foreigners are being carefully counseled on the various possibilities of support and financial support for a voluntary return journey. If the person does not help to travel voluntarily, the last resort will be forcibly and with the assistance of the police. Fortunately, this is only necessary in very few cases, and the vast majority of broadcasts are also done calmly, orderly and voluntarily. However, in cases where a foreigner does not leave voluntarily, I think it is reasonable that, as a last resort, an accompanying broadcast can be carried out, and also that, if necessary, power can be used for sending out. When power is used in those situations, it must be necessary and justified, and of course it must be done as gently as circumstances permit and taking into account that the alien is in a very difficult situation. But basically, I believe that the rule of law must be able to implement the decisions taken by the authorities, otherwise we might as well ignore the legislation agreed by a majority in the Folketing, and that is no good either, because we live in a democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132446	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132447	But it doesn't work to tear a family apart either. Has the minister seen the video where this 1-year-old child is crying and crying and can't stop because the child wants her mother, but the mother isn't there? It's a 1-year-old kid. If the rules are such that you break up families, if you separate a 1-year-old child from your mother, then there is something wrong with the rules; then we have to change them. Does the Minister think that it is okay for a child to be separated from his mother, according to the article on the right to family life in the Convention on Human Rights?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132523	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132524	Well, the authorities don't separate families. It is people who have to leave Denmark. If, for example, they do: If we are going to Iran, it is the responsibility of the authorities to get them all to Iran, preferably together. If you only have half the family, the other half of the family will of course be asked to help them to issue travel documents, which the embassies would like to hand out if people do so voluntarily. But it should not be the case that if people do not help to obtain their own passport so that they can actually leave the country, the rest of the family will not be sent. It's people themselves who let their families separate it's not the authorities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132604	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132605	But what about the child's best interests? Then the family will hold the child hostage, but then the government will hold the child hostage. The mother does not want to cooperate, the children suffer, and we do not want to cooperate, says the government, and then the government does not care about the child's best interests. Who cares about the baby? Now this video has been seen over a million times, and it can be assumed that the regime down in Iran has also seen this video, which is why the situation is completely different. Is this an opportunity to review the case, reopen it and re-evaluate the case so that the mother can stay here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132642	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132643	The authorities would like to cooperate. The authorities do nothing but cooperate with people who have been sentenced to expulsion and have been refused asylum in order to contribute to a voluntary and calm return. I just want to hold on to the fact that the law used by the police to use force is the law of the police. It applies to everyone in these countries. If someone doesn't come with the police, if they're going in and send them into jail, then they're also using force. If someone's filming it, it doesn't look good either. If there are mentally ill people in settlements where the police also need to use force, then they apply the same legislation. After all, we should not have two different legislations; we should not have one legislation for foreigners who are at the exit centre, where we do not use so much power, and then have another legislation for people who are going to jail and who may be outgoing mentally ill, where we then actually use force. We do not want this kind of discrimination. There's one law for citizens in this country, at least if it's up to the government.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132738	The questioner for a final question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132739	And I just have to maintain that the child's best interests must be the determining factor. If parents do not take responsibility, as is believed in the government when they do not move, then the government does not take responsibility for the child's best interests when the government says: because the mother does, we do too. That way, it's the baby that's gonna suffer. Finally, I would like to make an appeal: Dear Minister, this child is going to suffer for the rest of his life; it is going to leave a mark on the rest of the child's life; we are going to break up a family; we are going to destroy this child's life and opportunities. Now let's get this case reopened and make sure this mother stays with her 1-year-old child. The baby needs her mother.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132813	The minister for an end.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132814	Denmark has signed the Children's Convention, and I am very proud and happy that we have signed it, and that is why we are, of course, living up to it with the child's best interests. But children in this country of rejected asylum seekers and exiles must be very happy that it is not the Free Greens who sit in government, because if you can use your child as a hook to stay in the country, we will see lots of foreigners using the children, pushing them in front of you and using them as an opportunity to stay in Denmark. Let us maintain that we live in a rule of law, the Folketing has adopted rules, the police must, of course, comply with the rules governing the use of force, and they apply the same rules to rejected asylum seekers as they apply to Danes who have to enter and serve. There is no discrimination here, and the government will certainly not do that, regardless of what the Free Greens say.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132900	And we thank the Minister and ask him. The question is closed. The next question is to the Minister for Education and Research of Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132908	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132909	What does the Minister think it means for protection against future corona variants that the government has chosen to abandon vaccine cooperation with Austria and Israel?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132923	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406132925	Thank you for the question. When it comes to protection against new corona variants, it is essential to say that we are in a different situation today than we did a year ago. The planned cooperation with Israel and Austria was only one track out of several that the government set in motion at the start of the pandemic. Although we have decided to put an end to concrete cooperation, the government continues to support the priority given to research in the field of pandemics and pandemic preparedness, and here the main lead in international research cooperation has always been our European cooperation under the EU's Horizon Europe research programme. As I have emphasized several times in consultation and in answering questions from the Folketing, concrete cooperation with Israel and Austria was not a vaccine cooperation, but a research cooperation on pandemic preparedness, that is to say cooperation with a broader purpose. That is also what is apparent from the text of the budget appropriation. It was the Government's expectation that in the years to come we could launch and finance a number of joint research and innovation projects through open notices and projects with a broad focus on infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness, including, where appropriate, research into vaccine development, but not the production of vaccines. There is a long-term objective and considerable uncertainty about the end result when funding research. The hope is, of course, that new knowledge and research breakthroughs will be created and that this knowledge can make a difference in society. But basically, it was my expectation that the funds could contribute to establishing a good and long-term cooperation between research and innovation environments in the three countries and potentially more if more would join, thus strengthening Danish research and in the long term also our pandemic preparedness. As you know, we are not going to establish concrete cooperation, but are going to continue with the same purpose by other means in order to make Denmark better in the fight against future pandemics.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133119	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133119-2	That is an interesting answer, because the Prime Minister has shown with great media attention that we should have this cooperation with Austria and Israel, and the government had a desire to spend no less than 122 million. kr. of that cooperation. But when the government then encounters opposition in the circle of parties with which the government makes finance laws, against spending 122 million. kr. On that, the government chooses to drop it. Now we understand from the Minister for the Field that it is not very important for the Corona fight in Denmark that the 122 million is not being spent. kr. On it. It remains in very good hands and at least as good hands as if one had not dropped cooperation with Austria and Israel on corona fighting. How is it that, on the one hand, the government believes that cooperation was so important that no less than 122 million should be spent? kr. On the other hand, with the Minister's words, we are still very strong and very good, and it is not really important for our corona fight that we have now dropped this cooperation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133245	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133246	Thank you. Yes, it was 12 million. kr. ten years a year, and it should not sound as if we would not have liked it to be implemented. That is why the government has proposed it and worked for it to happen. What I am saying in my reply is that it has been intended from the outset as a complement to the European Union track, where a great deal has happened. Fortunately, this can continue and the progress that we would like to see can be made there, but not in connection with this cooperation. The parties that should be behind it and finance it did not want it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133326	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133326-2	However, I do understand that the Minister believes that the Danish corona fight will work very well and maybe even perfectly well, or are there some shortcomings in it? Are there shortcomings in the corona combat and the research on corona combat which we are now launching, because we are not spending 122 million? kr. the cooperation on the matter with Israel and Austria?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133353	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133354	It will be the case that many countries have a massive interest in bringing about a new development in this area. It went very fast when it really needed to, and you could also draw on basic research done in other contexts and move into the corona combat. That was very, very good, but we do have a need to keep interested in how we stand as a society, how we can be well equipped, be prepared to tackle a pandemic when it has to come another time, what it hopefully does not. But it happens by other means than this cooperation. And we would have liked to have seen it, but it cannot be implemented.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133431	Then we have a fellow inquirer, Morten Dahlin from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133435	Thank you. The Minister cannot mention what concrete shortcomings the now terminated cooperation will leave in the Danish pandemic effort, and at the same time the Minister says that other ways must now be found to close the gaps they lack and where the Minister will not explain what gaps and shortcomings it is. That is why the very obvious question to the Minister is this: can the Minister with regard to the 122 million? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his excellent report.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133517	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133518	The questioner is well aware that the funds when they are not used there, so to speak, go back into the treasury of the Finance Minister and they can be re-priorityd to other things, and a majority in the Folketing has done and chosen to use them elsewhere. However, research will continue in this field through the funds that have already been allocated, through EU cooperation, which was also one of the roads, the main road, to ensure some of the progress that has been made and which Danish researchers have also contributed to. I do not meet the two questioners today so much in research policy contexts, and perhaps that is why you think you can say that this money would have exactly led to some very specific progress. In other words, there would be themes we would be sticking out, open notices, researchers could bid in, here are some countries we would benefit from working with. We would have liked to have seen that. But there is no majority in favour of using those funds and then they are spent on something else. But that's how it goes, and we wouldn't be able to say exactly what it would have ended up with, just that it was on this theme. And we must then try to strengthen research in other ways.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133625	Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133626	But then the Minister will have to answer in the affirmative when Mr. Ole Birk Olesen asks whether there will be gaps or gaps in the upcoming action against corona and pandemics. Otherwise we would not have set up 122 million. kr. I hope that this will lead to concrete results. That is why it is perhaps only appropriate to ask the Minister to confirm that this is now when the government did not come through with its desire to spend 122 million. kr. on an effort with Israel and Austria, then will leave some gaps in the Danish corona- and epidemic effort. Isn't that correct?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133702	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133703	I think it's a great attempt on this little questioning rocket that's being shot off here, but it's not like that. We would have liked to have used those funds, and we also believe that we could have worked well together with Austria and Israel here. But with the amount we are talking about here, it is not the case that there is virtually no research going on in the field of pandemic preparedness or vaccine development anymore. After all, we're talking about huge amounts in a very different class from those used here, which will also find their way to this field. So I appreciate the concern, but I think you can barely put it up the way it is being tried today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133743	Then there is a final question for Mr. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133747	I think we have to note that the 122 million. kr. was not allocated to anything that the government considered particularly important. They were set aside for Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to have a selfie with some government leaders in Austria and Israel. It was a media gimmick that Denmark should be able to make something special out of cooperation with Austria and Israel in the fight against corona, and it was a 122 million. kr. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133822	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133823	But then we are probably approaching what this is all about: not at all concern about pandemic preparedness or research anything else, but some discussion about the Prime Minister and her work during the pandemic. And I am glad that we had a Prime Minister who tried all the ways to put us better and also to meet with some of the countries that had managed to tackle the pandemic well in various ways and which are also strong research nations and with which Denmark has a good cooperation. We shall continue to have this under a different heading from this specific cooperation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133858	Thank you. The question is closed and we thank the authors and stick to the Minister. The next question is also for the Minister for Education and Research, and that is by Katrine Robsøe, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133906	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133914	Thank you. What consideration is given to measures to promote the well-being of students in higher education in the country, in the light of the figures in the new national health profile • Danes Health • as among others. Does it show that more than one in three women and one in five men in 16-24 years of age have poor mental health?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133936	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406133939	Thank you for the question and the opportunity to discuss this important topic and focus on it. The figures to which the honourable Member refers also concern me as Minister. The fact that so many young people indicate that they have poor mental health is a social problem. That must and must never be the problem of the individual. I believe that it is a broad social debate that is needed, but we also have opportunities to address it in the field of education. The figures from the health profile have been collected during the corona closures, and this may of course have affected the result, but that is not a new problem. That is why we have also taken a number of initiatives from the government in recent years, and this is an issue on which we are constantly focusing. Since the government stepped in, we have among other things. removed the educational ceiling and had a great focus on student well-being during corona. For example: More than 100 million were set aside. kr. to a number of well-being efforts. I am also constantly discussing this issue with the higher education institutions, and only last week it was on the agenda for my meetings with the boards of directors of the individual education sectors. For me, an important tool for increasing the well-being is that we create a good framework for education. Therefore, all higher education institutions have set strategic objectives to promote the well-being and learning of students in their strategic framework contracts up to 2025, and it is therefore contracts which lay the foundations for how they will work and which have just been or will be concluded in this time. Most of them are signed now. My clear impression is that the institutions are also very aware of their responsibilities in increasing prosperity. There are good examples, for example. The architect's school in Aarhus, which is worth paying attention to. I will continue to focus on what we can do to support the well-being of students. In the near future, we will have to include, among other things: look at how the admission system for higher education and the rating scale can be improved in order to reduce inter alia: the experience of having a performance focus and pressure that many young people are experiencing, and there I look forward to there also being a collaboration with the Radical Left to hopefully achieve some good results. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134144	Thank you. The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134145	Thank you. As the Minister himself points out, this is not a new issue; it is a development that we have been able to follow for a long time, unfortunately. And it is also, in fact, one of the things that I really have a hope that, despite all kinds of good reasons why time has sometimes been spent on something else, we can also do something more about at the end of this parliamentary term. It is not enough to refer to what has been done under corona. One of the things that I know was set in motion in the first place is that the then Minister for Education and Research, Mrs Ane Halsboe-Jørgensen, set up this so-called well-being office. And I would really like to hear from the Minister what has actually come out of this well-being office.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134322	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134323	It is true that there is simply an office in the Ministry which has this as a task. And that is an expression of the fact that it is a focus on the part of the government. It was for my predecessor, as Mrs Katrine Robsøe has said, and it is for me too. As I said, a number of measures have already been taken, and I welcome the cooperation with the Radical Left on this, and we will have to continue this work. The recording system is one place, the characters, and how often you need them is another. This also applies to a different resort than my own. And these are also issues within my ministry, among others. I'm gonna be working with you in this office.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134402	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134404	I mean, I think it's a really good idea to focus on it, and it's good to have an office for it, but now that we're spending money on it, I also hope that we can get some concrete things out of it, because that's what I understood at the time in the government that you actually wanted to do, so get some new ideas on the table, something that might not have been up before. And the thing about grades and recording was already up in the election campaign before, so it can't be what was supposed to be the new thing this office was supposed to look at. So I would really like to hear: what is it that the office is now looking at that we should do about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134440	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134442	After all, this is going to be a very specific discussion, perhaps also a little outside of what has actually been asked. I can, of course, also discuss this on other occasions, if there is a need for further explanations. But when you do that, that is giving them the specific task, that is not the solution. After all, it is not the office that is the solution; it is the political actions that are being carried out. And there are a number of things that have happened in connection with corona, but also other things that focus on increasing the prosperity, and so it is a work that will continue and where there are also some of the people here who will advise the government and work on those issues.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134519	The questioner for the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134522	I do not know whether I fully agree with the Minister that it is not about hearing what the office of well-being has in the pipeline when you ask about the well-being of the students and the office is under the Ministry of Education. I just hope very much and have a call here that the Minister will get some direction on this and will get this up to the end. It may be that there is only one year left, but there is a lot to be done if this area is to be moved during this parliamentary term.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134600	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134603	There is a recognition of continued interest on the part of the Radical Left in raising this agenda and continuing to make new policy initiatives. That is also the government's wish, so let's see if we can still make it in about five quarters. Some examples are given here: the recording system, grades and other. We are continuing this work and I am pleased that the Radical Left is helping to push that agenda. Both within my area of responsibility, but in society at all, there is a need simply to have a social discussion about what kind of culture, standards and pressure many young people are experiencing in a way that is obviously also in an increased distrust. And that's worrying.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134647	Thank you. The question is closed and we thank the honourable Member. The next question is also to the Minister for Education and Research, and this is asked by Michael Aastrup Jensen from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134656	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134658	Thank you. The question is this: does the Minister agree that it is not good for Denmark's international reputation that the Prime Minister is making agreements with a corrupted Prime Minister in the middle of his election campaign?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134709	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134714	Thank you. I would say that it is, of course, a basic condition for democracies that sometimes people are in an election campaign. In this case it is Israel that is not so many democracies in the Middle East, Israel is a • and it should not stop our association with them, especially when we are in the midst of a pandemic. In the situation in which Denmark stood, the general attitude of the government was that new initiatives in relation to the fight against pandemics could not wait. The government would look into every possibility. So, no, I do not agree that the PM's handling of the Coronapandemic has damaged Denmark's international reputation, as is clear from the question. On the contrary, Denmark is seen in the same way as a country which, among other things. By virtue of strong political leadership, the Coronapandemic has succeeded quite well, it must be said. Of course we have had our challenges, but in an international comparison we are probably among the best, both in terms of health and in terms of economy. This has many honours, and I hope that I can agree with Mr Tugendhat. Michael Aastrup Jensen said that the Prime Minister did. I believe that there is nothing controversial about visiting Israel or discussing research cooperation with Israel. We have good cooperation with Israel in the field of research, and to this day we in Denmark benefit from the fact that the then Left Government established an innovation centre in Israel in 2016. It still exists, as I said, and indeed it did, while Benjamin Netanyahu was Prime Minister. I think that is a good thing to do, and of course Denmark will stick to that, just as we work well with Israel in other areas of research and innovation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134903	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406134904	Thank you for that answer. There is no doubt that I am also in favour of close cooperation with Israel, but the problem is the timing. The problem is, of course, that one chooses to be used, as it were, in an ongoing election campaign. That's not normal. I recognise that I have only spent 17 years in the Danish Parliament and therefore only know what has been normal in the last 17 years, but it is not normal for Denmark's Prime Minister to go down and become a party to an ongoing election campaign, not least an election campaign in Israel at that time, which was extremely polarised and where you were very divided about what was thought of the Prime Minister at that time. We can all remember how and how a so-called photo opportuny was suddenly created in a gym where the Prime Minister stands and sees Prime Minister Netanyahu standing and lifting weights and explaining how strong he is for a united Israeli press, so you can see that he is a strong man, while our prime minister stands next to him and looks at everything a little strangely. So one simply became a part of a large number of these different, we should say set up electoral situations, which I must admit I simply do not understand. When you went on the blade and asked why it was so necessary to go down there at that time, you were told that it was about life and death, that it was simply about now saving as many people as possible and that we should get the vaccine production going; so we went down to Israel. But what has come of it? That's the question, isn't it? The answer is that little has come of it, so there was no reason to go down and become a party to such an election campaign. After all, in the middle of the war in Ukraine, a press release was sneaked out that it was necessary to stop this cooperation. So, in the clear light of hindsight, wouldn't the Minister agree with me that you shouldn't have been down there and been a party to that campaign at the time?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135107	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135107-2	I would not agree with the questioner that it was not right for the leader of the country to look for every opportunity to cooperate with other countries in the fight against the pandemic. It's easy enough to get up here from afar and learn all sorts of things. However, it is wise and good for the Prime Minister of the country to do what can be done even if there is an election campaign in a democracy to cooperate with other countries to put Denmark and the Danes better in the fight against a pandemic. I don't know if that's comforting, sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, but Benjamin Netanyahu was not re-elected, so even if it has made an impression on anyone in Israel, it has hardly had any impact on the electoral process down there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135147	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135150	Thank you. Now the minister says it's at a distance. I already said that the second we saw the Prime Minister be down in Israel in these campaign events with the Prime Minister accused of corruption. Even then, I said it, and I actually thought it very, very strange that the government did not choose to have a discussion in the Foreign Policy Name, where I am also sitting, about these things. So I have to say that the fact that it's from a distance is the government's fault. That's because the government didn't choose to involve the Danish Parliament until you went down there, in this very, very much, we have to say sensitive programming work that was in going down there in the middle of an election campaign. So the government itself is responsible for the fact that we will have to discuss it after the visit took place.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135237	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135239	I do not know whether there has been any discussion along the way. Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen mentions a debate that was already going on at the time, and it has existed ever since. I have also explained to the Danish Parliament and have been in public discussion about the cooperation here. After all, the government would have liked us to be able to carry out a pandemic preparedness cooperation, i.e. a research cooperation on pandemic preparedness. This was not possible, and we have had a discussion on this here and also consultations on this in the past. But it was good that the Prime Minister sought opportunities to put Denmark better. I do not understand the controversial nature of that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135317	Then we've got questions, sir. Per Larsen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135327	Thank you. I would like to know exactly what considerations are being considered when the government decides to enter into an agreement with a corrupted head of state in the midst of such an election campaign there. Doesn't that send out any strange signals?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135350	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135351	I do not know whether the issue brings much new with it, compared to where we started before. But that is fair enough if several parties have an interest in raising the debate here. I think it was right for the Prime Minister, in the situation we were in, to explore all possible ways to put Denmark better in the fight against the pandemic. That is why a journey and dialogue were made with Israel and Austria specifically here, but also with other countries which had different experiences during the pandemic. What it came up with was that we could do a research cooperation on pandemic preparedness, which there has not been any support to go through with the parties behind the Finance Act. That is why it has been suspended. But the very fact that, as Prime Minister, we are going to look into the possibilities and have to accept that, when it comes to democracies, there may be an election campaign, is right and good. I think it is right and good that the leader of the country chose to do so. It was for the sake of making Denmark the best possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135459	Per Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135500	After all, the answer given by the Minister now raises the question: what kind of forces did Austria have in this situation? What was it you could do with Sebastian Kurz, for example? Did something quite openly say that there should be cooperation there at state level?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135524	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135525	There is the history of Austria and Israel being countries with which Denmark has good cooperation in the field of research. Austria is also very high, as Denmark does, in research appropriations. In the EU context, we often see things quite similar there, as both Austria and Israel had in various ways distinguished themselves in the handling of the pandemic and, in addition to the cooperation that was in the EU, the Prime Minister sought out other options. I thought that was good and right.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135558	Then there is a final question from Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135605	Thank you. I must admit that what remains is that nothing, like nothing, has come out of the Prime Minister's choice to be used in an election campaign in a divided Israel, and frankly I find that sad. So, although I am unfortunately well aware of the answer, I would hope that it will give us some thought anyway and that we will not again find ourselves in such a situation where we are being used in an election campaign in a divided country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135634	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135635	I guess that was more of a conclusion from Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen than a real question, and it is a good thing that the Left can bring it here. I would say that working with other countries, which can also be democracies, while there is an election campaign and how long is it really? We have an idea that it may be 3 weeks, but it may also be a long time when one can claim that now there is an election campaign... must not limit one when one is in a pandemic and needs to search out all the possibilities to put the country better. That was the case here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135708	The question is closed. We say thank you to the questioners. I should like to inform you that Question No 1, by Mr von der Vring, will be answered in writing. 10 to the Minister for Education and Research by Kim Valentin, Left, is deleted from the agenda. The next question is also to the Minister for Education and Research, and that is by Mr. Morten Dahlin from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135719	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135727	Thank you, President. What is the Minister's consideration of the Prime Minister's vaccine trip to Israel during an Israeli election campaign, and does the Minister think that vaccine cooperation has been worth the effort?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135737	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135739	As I also said in my answer to question 686 it is, after all, a basic condition for democracies that people are sometimes in an election campaign. When it actually starts and ends, many may think it's a little fluent. And that should not stop our relations with these democracies, especially when you are in the midst of a pandemic. And as I did before, I must also remind you that Netanyahu is not a social democrat, and he was not re-elected either. So there are no limits to the influence that has been exerted on the elections in Israel. I think you might be overdoing it a little bit. It is important to remember what situation Denmark was in back in March 2021. Only about 9%. of the Danes had begun a covid-19 vaccination, only 6.7 per cent. were fully vaccinated and the vaccines were still delivered very slowly at that time. In Israel the situation was different. In March 2021, Israel was the country that had come the longest with the deployment of vaccines and thus had the most current understanding of their effect in the fight against covid-19 infection. Over 50%. of the population had started vaccination, and 36% had started vaccination. were fully vaccinated. Therefore, Israel was also a natural place to look into the government's efforts to make Denmark better. Throughout the pandemic, the government had stood firm on the importance of turning every stone to make Denmark the best possible and had prioritised international cooperation through the EU, where Denmark has purchased vaccines for the Danish population, and we have engaged in the EU's efforts to strengthen the future European pandemic preparedness. In the field of research, this has also been done through the Horizon Europe programme • a large number of research and innovation projects • and, in addition, some bilateral tracks such as those of today. Then it is the case that when you start a lot of work, it is not always that everything succeeds. That's too bad, of course. That is the way it is in politics and indeed in life. But that does not mean that we should not try, and I think it is both too easy and wrong to say that it was not worth the effort. We would have liked to have seen this cooperation carried out with Israel and Austria, with which we cooperate well in the field of research.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135954	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406135955	I would like to thank the Minister for his answer to the first part of the question: what are the considerations of the Minister doing? And then it can be said with a bold remark that even the government has found limits on what they think the Social Democratic Government can do. After all, the results of the elections in Israel cannot be influenced. And it's worth recognizing that we can take it on a Wednesday like this. The second part of the question was whether the Minister believes that vaccine cooperation with Israel and Austria has been worth the effort. The Minister did not answer that question. And that is actually a very short answer I am looking for: does the Minister believe that it has been worth the effort?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140032	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140033	I think it was right for the Prime Minister to seek this cooperation. And the government would have liked to see it implemented as well. That would, of course, have led to some research projects which would then not be carried out. That would have resulted in a higher return. But you just have to say that when you try to do everything possible for your country and in cooperation with others put it better during a pandemic, it is not certain that it all succeeds. In other words, there have been some obstacles to the implementation of this cooperation. But it's right to try. I wonder if the criticism would have been that you were too passive if things like this had not been done.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140115	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140116	That is probably not the whole answer to the question of whether it was worth the effort, and that is why, because I am in my generous mood today, I would like to give the Minister the opportunity to respond once again, and this time perhaps even reply briefly, clearly and precisely: does the Minister believe that the start-up of this vaccine cooperation with Austria and Netanyahu in Israel was worth the effort, yes or no?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140142	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140143	Well, I'm thinking that the style here probably reflects very well that when I don't see so much of Mr. Thompson... Morten Dahlin in the discussion about research policy in everyday life, it is because it is actually more controversial and less research that is at stake here. And that's fair enough. But that is to say, seeking to establish cooperation with other countries and making Denmark the best possible in the fight against a pandemic, I think it is right and good that a prime minister does. This cooperation cannot be carried out; there is no support for using the funds for it, but we would have liked to have seen that. And I guess that's what this is all about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140221	Then it's the co-questioner, sir. Per Larsen of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140226	Thank you. I would like to ask the Minister how much resources, financial resources have actually been spent here. How many dollars has it cost to try to establish this cooperation with Israel?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140248	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140250	No funds have been used from the money set aside in the Finance Act. This has simply not been achieved before the decision has been taken to suspend that cooperation. I would point out that no agreement had been signed; work was under way in order to do so, but no actual agreement had been signed and therefore no money was paid out for specific research projects. So that money has been given priority for other purposes, and that has also been done by a majority of the Folketing. Then I will come back to the debate and maybe it can get a little tiring for those who have been following it from the beginning • that I think it is right and good that a prime minister is looking for opportunities for cooperation during a pandemic to put the country the best possible way, and some things will be able to give a very direct return, something else not. That is the way it is, and I wonder if the criticism of the Prime Minister would have been that she was too passive if the efforts had not been made.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140357	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140359	But I do not imagine that there would have been much criticism if the Prime Minister had stayed home, because we have commercial companies which have researched a great deal in vaccines and which have also succeeded in doing so. And fortunately, we had made a very good strategy by securing vaccines, which also had a good effect. So isn't the conclusion that taking that trip to Israel was a waste of resources?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140429	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140429-2	I have to say that I think it is a rather narrow view of how we as a country and how we in the field of research are going to contribute to our being stronger. We can't do that alone. That is why a main lead has always been European cooperation, and the research programmes there have also been concrete purchases of vaccines through the European Union, as I mentioned before, but also research. Here there was an opportunity to add further cooperation. Why should it be reckless to look into the possibilities of carrying out further research projects with countries with which we cooperate?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140510	Thank you. Then it's mr. Morten Dahlin for a final question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140514	In the course of today's debate, the Minister has used the term polemics on opposition issues on several occasions. I just want to say that we do not see it as polemics, we see it as snuff, and we see it as our duty to keep the government up to the point that a lot of projects are not being launched that are expensive and take a long time and that no end product comes out of. That is why it is also important, as a government, to have the ability to look inwards and evaluate one's own efforts at times. That is why I would just like to ask the Minister once again: if, in this way, the Minister thinks that this trip to Israel has been worth the effort, what has actually come of it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140556	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140557	It was one of those things. The government's desire to carry out this specific research cooperation, and Mr. Morten Dahlin is well aware of the reasons why it could not be achieved that a majority did not support it among the parties included in the government's financial agreement. The purpose of such cooperation must then be to search other ways through European research programmes and other bilateral cooperation, and that is what we must do when there is no majority in favour of making the appropriation we would have liked to see.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140637	We thank you for that. Thank you to the questioner and thank you to the Minister. The next question is to the tax minister of Preben Bang Henriksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140653	Then I think we're getting ready for it. Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140703	Thank you. It went a little fast in the line of questions, which is why we weren't quite prepared. We are now. The question is: what is the Minister's view that it is not possible to ascertain whether revenue has been collected from the tax authorities in cases of chain fraud, money laundering, etc. for 1.5 billion respectively. DKK 270 million kr. and 2 billion. kr.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140730	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140731	Thank you for the question. I would like to emphasise that Danish taxpayers generally pay tax claims on time. More than a thousand billion dollars are collected annually in taxes and charges. After all, it is a hunk of which 79 percent. paid. For control requirements, it is the Danish Tax Office's experience that the payment rate is generally approx. 90% When it is not possible to quantify the exact revenue from checks carried out by, for example, money laundering, VAT fraud or chain fraud that has been paid is due to the fact that it is not automatically recorded in the tax administration's payment systems, i.e. whether a claim has been created as a result of a control project or a general declaration. It will therefore require a large and resource-intensive manual review to determine the actual payments for each control project. These are resources which can instead be used to make it difficult for companies which cannot and will not answer any of their own. Having said that, the Danish Tax Office is constantly working to learn how much of the tax requirements in control projects are being paid. That is a priority with which I fully agree. In concrete terms, an analysis has been initiated which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. I would also like to point out that, in general, action is being taken against taxpayers who cannot and will not pay. If the claim is not paid according to the Danish Tax Office's reminder procedure, it is sent to the Danish Debt Authority, which has sanction options, which increases the payment rate further. For example, the Debt Board may: make statements on the assets of undertakings or contain amounts directly in the debtor's salary. In conclusion, I am pleased that there is broad support from the Danish Parliament's parties for the government's reform of tax control, which among other things. ensures the recruitment of a total of 1,000 new employees in the Tax Administration. In this context, the collection area has been strengthened, inter alia, for: more targeted collection efforts. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140927	Here you go, sir. Preben Bang Henriksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406140929	Thank you. I am here with some press releases from the Danish Tax Office, finely colored, and straight to smoke in the newspaper with headlines and summaries and graphs etc., March 2021, September 2021 and October 2021 respectively. In a positive sense, it was by the tax authorities that control measures against chain fraud and money laundering, etc., work here. We are now charging so many crowns, i.e. a total of 7.5 billion. kr. It covers these three I'm holding in my hand. Does the Minister not think that it is extremely strange that it has been possible to do it quite precisely up to 7.4 billion? kr., is it shown, and has been able to issue such continuous notifications about which charges are now being sent in the various cases? And when it comes to documenting what has been said about the individual cases in crowns and ears, that is to say, almost what the population is most interested in, yes, then it cannot be done. I find it extremely strange. I think the people have a right to know how the recovery works against these crooks. That's one thing. The other thing is, have tax penalties been brought in these cases? The latter is not the tax minister's job, it is the Minister of Justice's job to answer. I think I can already lift the veil that it is probably hardly there. So the more complicated a case is, the more difficult it is to get to grips with it in the Kingdom of Denmark. It is a tremendous problem of financial fraud. But that is not today's question to the tax minister. That is the question: Do the Danes not have a right to know how recovery works in these cases? And why can we not have that answer when it was possible to publish so strongly on individual cases that collections had now been issued?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141130	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141131	Logically, when you send out a collection, it works, I think, for most of us quite intuitively, that you must also be able to see how much money comes in, i.e. if people pay the bill they get. And don't we have a right to know? Yeah, I think that's pretty logical. First of all, we have the right to have a tax administration that works, and it is no secret to any of us that the tax administration has been challenged. The large capacity now being used for IT development goes on real estate debt, etc. In other words, paying that claim is not so simple.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141211	Preben Bang Henriksen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141212	Thank you. I still don't think I got an answer. If it is the case that you can specifically make up your mind in any case, you can even send out the debt at three intervals, how it is made up, how it is collected from the individual, then it seems very strange to me that you cannot answer the public if the money comes in. That is deeply unsatisfactory. Does the Minister think that is okay and will he be working to get that information out?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141243	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141245	As I referred to, the Danish Tax Office is constantly working on getting smarter on exactly that, and that is, as I also said, a priority that I actually fully agree with and also agree with the questioner. In concrete terms, then, an analysis is done which is finished at the end of the year, and then we would like to look at it together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141310	Sir. Preben Bang Henriksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141311	I can only say that I cannot be told in this Chamber whether recovery is effective either. I can be told that some collections have been sent out, but I cannot be told whether the money has been paid. I think that is simply deeply unsatisfactory, but it really does fall very well into the fact that a journalist from Jyllands-Posten has apparently asked four times, namely on 30 November, 9 December, 20 December and 11 January, and has always been told that the reply was postponed until 20 January, and then it has been told that there were no resources to respond. I find that unsatisfactory.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141341	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141343	We have a tax administration which in many areas is really, really good and well functioning, but which is also challenged it is no secret. As I also referred to here, it will take a large and resource-intensive manual review to calculate this. It may be hard to understand that when you send something out, you can't just press a button and get the result of what comes in, but that's how it is right now. Now an analysis is made of what is finished at the end of the year, and then we can look at it together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141408	The question is over. Thank you to the Minister, and thank you, Mr President. Preben Bang Henriksen. That concludes Question Time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141416	The debate is open. Mrs. Ida Auken, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141431	Thank you very much. The night of February 24, Russia launched an extensive military operation against Ukraine. What we see is a full invasion of a peaceful and free sovereign nation. It is an attack on peace and stability and it is an attack on the peaceful times we have seen since the end of the Cold War. It calls for a response. A single European Union has adopted comprehensive restrictive measures against the background of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the proposal here has to be seen in this context. Now we are taking another step in condemning Russia's invasion. As the rules are today, it is possible to approve whole courses abroad for su. This also applies to education in Russia and Belarus, but as a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we do not believe that full education should be approved by Denmark for su in Russia and Belarus. For this reason, the draft law gives the Minister for Education and Research temporary authority to lay down rules that full training in certain countries cannot be approved for su. This applies both to training which has already been approved, where approval could be suspended, and to potential new applications for approval. The proposal has a sunset clause so that the law is automatically repealed on 1 January 2024. The Minister for Education and Research has already called on higher education institutions to cease research and innovation cooperation with institutions in Russia and Belarus. Similarly, the Minister has called for the failure to initiate new development processes with institutions in Russia and Belarus. We in the Social Democratic Party think this is sensible. It is important that we clearly show our support for Ukraine. The proposal here is a small but important contribution to the condemnation of Russia's war, which is why the Social Democrats support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141639	We thank the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we move on to Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141656	Thank you. I do not believe that enough can be said about how terrible a situation Ukraine has been in for more than a month now. Last week, President Zelensky of Ukraine made a touching and deeply serious speech to the Danes and the Danish Parliament with a call to put further pressure on Russia's grip on Ukrainians, and with common sanctions we and the rest of the international community have already done a great deal, but we must continue to do so. That is why this bill is also absolutely justified. Under these circumstances, we should not support education in either Russia or Belarus with a Danish su. It would be a completely wrong signal to send, and at the same time it is right that a sunset clause should be added to the draft law, which is due to last until 1 January 2024 so that the law can be adapted to the future situation. I understand that there are still some students in Russia who are still getting Danish su and who will not be affected by this bill. We will probably be asking a few questions about that in the Left, but in addition to that, the Left can support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141812	We thank the rapporteur. There are no brief comments and we move on to Mrs Astrid Carøe, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141823	Thank you. Like the other rapporteurs before me, I also really think that this is a terrible situation that is currently taking place in Ukraine. We are witnessing an attack on the free world, and I believe that we have all been and are very deeply affected by the development of the war, and that is why there is no doubt that political action is needed, including in the field of education. It is vital that we stand together on our common democratic values. I am very pleased that the Minister has urged the Danish universities to cease cooperation in Russia and Belarus. Because the aggression we are seeing right now must have consequences and, as I see it, we must avoid having Danish students on Russian and Belarusian grounds as far as possible. That is why it is also important that today, with the proposal here, we emphasise our condemnation of the actions of Russia and Belarus, and, above all, that we support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, and this is, of course, in order to take a clear stand against the violence currently being carried out, but also from a security point of view for our students. It is no use having su-approved education in countries that are aggressively waging war in Europe. It doesn't belong anywhere. So it is good that the educational institutions of the two countries are now being removed from the board's list of su-approved options, and we therefore support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406141948	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we move on to Mrs Katrine Robsøe, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142000	Thank you. I agree with what has been said. The bill here is really fine. Of course, we must also be able to act on the current situation and ensure that full education in Russia and Belarus is not su-approved in the coming period. It makes really good sense. It is a very small thing, I think, that we too must acknowledge, but nevertheless nice to have with us, and that is why, of course, Radicals are also supporting a small step in the direction in which we must, of course, go. I agree with SF's point that this is, of course, also about having security for the Danish students we send out into the world. Then I have to say that I am very pleased that there is, of course, a sunset clause in the draft law here, because we are opening the door for the Minister to suspend certain countries, and I also assume that if there is a situation where the Minister will use it for countries other than Russia and Belarus, then the parties of the Folketing will be consulted. Radicals, as I said, naturally support the bill, and I should like to welcome it from the Enhedslisten and say that they do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142123	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we are on to Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142136	Thank you. The Conservative People's Party is looking with horror at what is happening in Ukraine right now, and we take the sharpest distance from all the acts of war that are taking place on Ukrainian soil. It is inhumane and who would have thought that we would have a war in Europe just six months ago? This is not the kind of Europe we want. We will by no means support a warring nation. We want a free Europe. The sanctions from all over Europe are strong and necessary to show our sympathy to Ukraine. That is why we do not want to be involved in sending Danish students to Russia, where they have their su in the suitcase. Indeed, it would be an indirect support to the Russian state and, at the same time, a blue stamp on Putin's regime. With these words, the Conservative People's Party supports the proposal of the Minister to suspend aid for higher education in Russia and Belarus from August and with a sunset clause which means that the law will automatically be repealed from 1 January 2024.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142249	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, so we move on to Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142256	Thank you. This is a terrible situation that we are witnessing in Ukraine. It is therefore also obvious that we must do what we can to put pressure on Russia and condemn the actions that are taking place. And that's why this proposal is also important, primarily as a symbol and a mark. It is not very many students, but it sends the signal that we will not support this either in Russia or in Belarus. It is of course important that there is a sunset clause on the law, so that it automatically disappears on 1 January 2024, and until then we are confident that the Minister will use its powers by agreement. The Danish People's Party supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142343	Thank you to the rapporteur. I do not see that there are any brief comments and no more rapporteurs have asked to speak. That is why it is now the Minister. Here you go to the Minister of Education and Research.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142402	Thank you for the support to be able to deal urgently with the bill here today. As other rapporteurs have said, and as the comments on the draft law also show, it is of course in relation to the invasion of Ukraine that we have seen started on 24 February by the Russian side. It has led to an extraordinary situation in Denmark and throughout Europe, and it has also given us the opportunity to consider the current system of when we send young people out into the world to read and master themselves with Danish su in the backpack. This is an opportunity that we must continue to hold on to, but as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, the government does not believe that Danish education in Russia and Belarus should be su-approved in the current situation. There are currently 11 education in Russia and one education in Belarus which has been approved for su. Other training courses in these countries will also be eligible if they meet the general conditions. The government has therefore put forward this bill, which aims to give me, as a minister, temporary authority to lay down rules on the non-approval of training courses in certain countries. This will have to apply both in relation to the courses already approved, where the approval may be suspended, and in relation to any new applications for approval. The authorisation will be used in relation to education in Russia and Belarus, but it will also be possible to lay down rules that education in countries other than the two cannot be approved. However, I would like to emphasise, as the draft law also shows, that the authorisation will be used only in relation to the current situation regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine and where the situation so requires. This is not a general desire to shut down the possibilities of being able to take part in approved courses in other countries and get the contribution to one's education and cultural knowledge and linguistic knowledge, etc., which are of course so many benefits when you as a student take part of your education in another country. It is specifically in relation to this situation and a clear signal to Russia that this kind of aggression leads to isolation within the international community. This is also true in the field of research, where the call I made very quickly to universities has also been followed. By the way, I had a meeting yesterday with the Ukrainian Ambassador, who also signed up for that reaction and the willingness to show an isolation of Russia and a clear disapproval of education and research as well. This is a temporary arrangement which will be automatically repealed on 1 January 2024. I would like to thank you for the broad support for the legislative proposal and for the urgent procedure, and I look forward to further consideration and further discussions. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142715	Thank you. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Education and Research Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142730	The debate is open. Sir. Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142745	This bill ensures that foreigners who are accompanying family members of a foreign worker who acquire Danish citizenship can continue to reside in Denmark. In addition, it is proposed that foreigners who are accompanying family members of a foreign student or intern may also be allowed to stay in Denmark and not lose their residence permit if their family member acquires Danish citizenship. The bill is among other things: motivated by a case with a 47-year-old Indian worker who in 2008 came to Denmark on a business scheme to work at Odense University Hospital. When the Indian worker wanted to apply for Danish citizenship, it turned out that his accompanying family members would lose their residence permit in Denmark. A few months ago we read about a high school student who was about to be sent out of Denmark because her mother had come here as a foreign worker but had become a Danish citizen. The examples mentioned with accompanying family members who lose their residence permit in Denmark because their family member becomes a Danish national indicate that the rules in this area have not been appropriate. Social democracy therefore supports the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142902	I do not see any brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Morten Dahlin from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406142920	Thank you for that, President. It is important for Denmark that we as a society have the opportunity to attract qualified international labour. When skilled international employees come to the country, they help to make Denmark richer and our community stronger. It is therefore important that we have a system that makes it flexible and unbureaucratic to recruit qualified international labour. One of the things we know to be important to international employees is, of course, one might say that they can bring their family to Denmark, otherwise the Danish companies will probably find it extremely difficult to recruit the necessary manpower. I therefore believe that, on the political side, we also have the task of ensuring that Danish companies have good opportunities to attract the necessary labour. And one of the things we have seen has been a blockade is that people who come here to Denmark on an occupational scheme that contributes, behaves properly and integrates and is here for so long as they acquire Danish citizenship may encounter the problem that their family's residence permit is tied to their own residence permit and that the residence permit disappears when they acquire Danish citizenship. This means that the family of the now Danish citizen can lose their residence permits and therefore have to apply for family reunification and that during that period they are not allowed to work in Denmark. Most people see this as inappropriate, and it has not been the intention of the Danish legislation on foreigners. That is why we in the Left are in favour of making this change of law so that people and their families are not made worse because they acquire Danish citizenship. In fact, we were also in favour of the idea when the original motion for a resolution from the Radical Left was discussed in this Chamber. At that time, however, we voted against the resolution because we wanted to make sure that the proposal did not lead to finding a way of avoiding the demands of family reunification, as well as a number of other things. But we also said at the time that when the government had finished looking at this area and had done a review of the rules, we were willing to engage in dialogue on it. That work has now been completed and the result is the bill we are discussing here today. And we immediately believe that the government has found a good balance and has solved the challenges that we saw in the original resolution. That is why we in the Left welcome this bill and we look forward to the further examination of the committee.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406143205	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. I do not see any rapporteur from the SF, so we move on to Mrs Kathrine Ollldag from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406143227	Thank you, President. Having Danish citizenship or Danish citizenship can be a long, tough fight, but common sense ends when you are forced to choose between either having Danish citizenship or forsaking it and living with your family instead. That is a totally unreasonable dilemma to face. Today, the rules are such, and they are the ones we are together here today to change the fact that you can bring your family to Denmark if you are on an occupational scheme, but if you become a Danish citizen, the rules are different. This means that the spouse of the person who goes from being in Denmark on an occupational scheme to becoming a Danish citizen may lose the right to be in Denmark. There may be demands on foreigners who come here, who may even be subject to strict requirements, but this is just crazy. It lacks common sense. Real people have gotten into a mess. We could see this in the media and in the public debate. This was true of the Indian girl Mishti in February of this year as well as of Indian Deepak, whose case appeared in 2020. By that time he had been many years in Denmark on an occupational scheme with his wife, and now he wanted to seek citizenship. These are two good examples of why it is important for us as politicians to listen to the people affected by our legislation. It may be that something has to be changed at times. Foreigners who have come to Denmark on an occupational scheme should not be disadvantaged if they acquire Danish citizenship, and I am really glad that we are a majority of the Danish Parliament's parties who can now see the sense of it, so we support of course.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406143413	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. We welcome Mrs Rosa Lund from the Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406143429	Thank you, President. In fact, I would like to begin my rapporteur's speech by thanking the Radical Left for raising this matter and putting forward the resolution a long time ago, which was called B 32, which we also discussed in this Chamber almost a year and a half ago. It is, of course, a slightly different tone and tone than there have been on the previous foreign policy proposals that are on this bill, and I think that in itself just makes the bill a little more pleasant reading than the bill that otherwise comes from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We have in Denmark so far faced the absurd situation that a foreign specialist who has come to Denmark to solve some tasks that we ourselves have not been able to solve is in fact better off in securing his family residence permit than his neighbour, who is a Danish citizen. If then the foreign specialist chose to apply to stay here for the rest of his life, for example, if he/she. had his children here, their family would lose the residence permit, and the specialist would be placed just as badly as a native Danish citizen. Then why? It is, of course, because we have a number of parties in this Parliament who have been very busy making one tightening after another than they have had to make legislation that actually makes sense for Danish citizens. We have had a situation in which an ordinary person who does his job, contributes to Danish society and, moreover, carries out an essential task in the Danish health service, has to give up applying for Danish citizenship, because the family would then lose their residence permit if citizenship were actually acquired. We in the Enhedslist think this is absolutely absurd, and it is the result of many years of tightening up in the area of family reunification and in the area of residence permits. In the Enhedslisten we have a very clear position on that. It must be easier for people with permanent residence and Danish citizenship to have family reunification, and in recent years we have seen how the screw has been tightened and tightened so that Danish citizens who want family reunification must meet a wide range of comprehensive requirements. It is strict language requirements, it is a requirement of how much money you should have on the coffin floor, and it is a requirement of where in society you should live. They will also enter into force as soon as you pass from having an ordinary residence permit on the business scheme to obtaining Danish citizenship. Fortunately, this bill, now coming from the government, results in a partial removal of the excessively strict rules, at least for some, because it will still be the case that if you were born with your Danish citizenship, you will have to continue through a long process and too many demands to have family reunification. I also think it's remarkable that you have made this bill when you could actually have changed the rules for permanent stay, so it was a little easier to get a permanent stay in Denmark, because then we didn't have to make all these jumbles, which I actually kind of consider this bill to be. The Enhedslisten supports the bill, I am glad that we are now solving this problem, but I think it is remarkable that we do not go in and make the Aliens Act more simple and say that we can just ease on the residence permit rules, because then we would not actually be in this problem at all. Now we're going to make another jump, another lap on top of the patchwork of an alien law we have today. I think this is a good patch, but I think it would be better if we started from scratch and ensured that whether you are here on a residence permit, if you have just become a Danish citizen, or if you are a born Danish citizen, it should not be difficult to be allowed to live with your family in Denmark. That is why we had in Enhedslisten, and I hope that is not a secret either, rather that one had actually made it a little easier to get a permanent stay in Denmark. So there was no majority in favour of that, that is not the case. What is the case is that you are now changing the rules in the way that has been proposed in the bill, which, after all, makes it easier to get your family to Denmark if you are on a business scheme and become a Danish citizen, and we very warmly support this in the Enhedslisten. I hope that this can be the start of a number of positive bills from the Foreign Minister, which make it a little easier to be a foreigner in Denmark. The Enhedslisten supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406143908	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Marcus Knuth, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406143917	Thank you, President. I'll try to be brief. This bill is based on the motion for a resolution which came from the Radical Left, in which we were actually in favour of it, not least because it followed on from the case of Mishti, which has been mentioned several times, the young woman from India, who was in danger of losing her residence when the mother was given citizenship. However, what the Radical Left proposed was a kind of new parallel system, so that at the moment of birth, your children also had to have an automatic extension of the residence permit. It was a bit of a bias compared to all sorts of other people who are seeking family reunification in this country. But there is an extra leg on this bill, precisely that if, at the time of the decision, the family member continues to fulfil the conditions of their residence permit which they had when a permanent residence permit was granted, it must continue temporarily, not as a permanent residence. And precisely against this background, contrary to the resolution, Conservatives support this bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144032	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144043	Thank you, President. Indeed, where the government's bill may at first sight seem sympathetic and logical, a closer examination of the proposal reveals that its adoption will lead to new inappropriateities in the law on foreigners. First of all, it must be stated that there must be a very limited problem. From the answer to questions 2 to B 32 from 2020-21, the adoption of which is a consequence of this proposal, it appears that the Agency for International Recruitment and Integration cannot answer how many cases a accompanying family member has had his residence permit withdrawn as a result of the fact that the main person, that is, the worker, has been granted Danish citizenship. Probably it is an absolute minority seeking citizenship in Denmark, knowing that your spouse may lose his or her right to a residence permit in Denmark if granted. It may seem at first sight sympathetic that an accompanying spouse may be granted an extension of his residence permit, regardless of the fact that the foreign worker acquires Danish citizenship, but the adoption of the proposal merely creates a new inappropriateness. This creates the situation that foreign nationals who have come here as employees and who subsequently acquire Danish citizenship gain de facto a more relaxed access to family reunification than Danish nationals who are Danish from birth. And it is quite simple because when they arrived here as foreign employees, they had easier access to having spouses and children in Denmark, precisely because they came as employees. In the Danish People's Party, we will not be helping to put certain individuals who have acquired citizenship by law better than Danes who have been Danes since birth. After all, we in the Danish People's Party believe that access to Danish citizenship should be restricted. We have previously proposed a quota for how many foreigners can become Danish citizens, and we also want restrictive access for particularly non-Danish nationals to obtain family reunification in Denmark. In conclusion, I must conclude that the Danish People's Party will not support the proposal from the government, since it is a discrimination in favour of people who have acquired Danish citizenship, who, if the government's proposal is adopted, are better placed than people who are born Danes. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144313	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144329	I think this bill actually has some good tactics. We can see that there may be a problem in current legislation if some of the few who come here on some of these occupational schemes contribute actively and positively, benefit Denmark, assimilate themselves, adapt, contribute actively, support themselves, do not commit crime, all these things, provided that they do not, of course, come from the circle of countries that we wish to exclude from the outset. At the same time, however, there are some things in this draft law that give rise to further questions, and these are the ones we will take in committee before we can take a final position. In New Citizens we basically believe that it is all too easy today to obtain Danish citizenship, and we have also proposed a number of different proposals on how to ensure that far fewer people gained Danish citizenship. What we are talking about here is, I know, a very, very limited group, so small and limited that it is hardly even possible to make an estimate of how many it is going to hit. However, it is clear that it is inappropriate if the spouse of the feed master who has come to our discussions also about Ukraine could be thrown out of the country if the feed master has actively contributed, assimilated and so on. However, as I have said, we are largely in favour of large parts of this draft law, but need to clarify some issues in committee before we can finally say yes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144515	Thank you. There are no brief comments. We thank the rapporteur. I do not see any more rapporteurs present in the Chamber, so I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144526	Thank you, Mr President, and thank the rapporteurs for the discussion. The draft law is the implementation of a resolution adopted a year ago. As the rules are today, the accompanying family of a foreign worker loses his residence in Denmark when the foreign worker acquires Danish citizenship. This is an inappropriate way of congratulating the worker on the achievement of Danish citizenship. The bill amends the rules so that people who are already in Denmark as accompanying family can be granted an extension of their residence permit, even if the main person acquires Danish citizenship, as long as the main person has an employment that would be able to grant a residence permit under one of the occupational schemes. This applies both to accompanying families of foreign workers, but also to students and trainees. We have seen examples of highly qualified workers who want to be Danish citizens but who opt out of it because the family is at risk of losing their residence permit, and that is not the case, of course. It is not the world's largest legislative proposal, and I admit that it does not concern thousands of people, but I think it is common sense and that is the direction we should take. With the bill we ensure that it will not have consequences for the family's stay in Denmark, when competent foreigners who help Danish companies want to be Danish citizens. This will solve the problem which I believe has given many of us grey hair when we have read about it in the media, without compromising on the broad policy of foreigners. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144657	Thank you. There are no brief comments. We thank the Minister. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144715	The negotiations have been opened. I give the floor first to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406144735	Thank you again to the President for the floor and also to the authors of the motion for a resolution B 163. The system of cash assistance which the present government took over from the previous government was, we felt, unbalanced, not least as a result of countless rounds of gunshots. There was then a clear imbalance with the children, and that was why we introduced the temporary family allowance as a helping hand to the families of children. The temporary family allowance does not alter the fact that the government has both pursued and maintained a strict foreign policy. That, of course, is clear. And it's not just about benefits. In the past, the Government has put forward proposals for the introduction of 37 hours' work obligations. It is a question of ensuring that newcomers and others with an integration need cannot go home and receive a service without making reasonable demands on them. Requirements are the way to integration and to the Danish labour market. Immediately after the government's accession in 2019, we started preparing to set up a Services Commission for among others. to look at the conditions of the children. Children in Denmark must of course grow up under proper conditions and with the opportunity to be an active part of the community. The Minister for Employment received the Commission's recommendations some time ago and had discussions with the Danish Parliament's parties on the recommendations. The discussions continue with the Minister for Employment. Although there are many good tactics in the Commission's proposal, the government wants a better balance between three key considerations. Firstly, the level of benefits must not be at a level which in itself increases the flow to Denmark. Secondly, children in Denmark must grow up under reasonable conditions with the possibility of being an active part of the community. And thirdly, there must be a gain by taking a job, also a noticeable gain. The system must also include vulnerable and vulnerable groups and support the possibility and attractiveness of taking small jobs, which may be the way to become part of the working community. This is the starting point for the Minister of Employment and the Government in the negotiations on a new system of benefits. So we agree with the proposers that working in Denmark should be worthwhile. Those issues will be addressed in the current negotiations, and the government is therefore recommending that the proposal be rejected. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145007	Thank you. Mr President, there is one brief comment. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145011	I'm really sorry the government does. I am sorry that the government cannot support this proposal, which I really think is common sense. I would therefore like to ask the Minister a very simple question. When the Minister has decided that unemployed immigrant families should be rewarded with a tax-free check of DKK 2,000. Does the Minister expect that it will make more immigrant families actually enter the labour market and contribute to Denmark, or does the Minister expect that it will have the opposite effect, namely that more will remain on passive support and thus be a burden on Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145054	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145054-2	I believe that the economic textbooks will be reasonably clarified in relation to the fact that the more one closes the gap between the transfers that people receive from the state and the minimum wage that people can receive in the labour market, the less the incentive to go to work. But we must also bear in mind, after all, that employment among non-western immigrants in Denmark is actually increasing in these years and that there is indeed record employment. There is that generally in society, but what is happening among non-western immigrants actually shows a higher level of employment than we see in society in general. So the bottom line is, after all, that we are standing here in April 2022 and can see that more immigrants are working and supporting themselves and that more children are growing up and watching their parents go to work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145144	Is there a request for another brief remark? Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145149	Yes, yes, but it can still be said that the employment rate of non-western immigrants in Denmark is so low that it costs society 16 billion each year. kr., compared to if they were in employment as much as ethnic Danes. However, it is also a slim money at the end of the month, and it is only in relation to employment. A single cash benefit recipient over 30 years of age with two children receives public benefits before tax and that is so inclusive allowance for day care • 25.200 DKK. per month in Denmark. How can one as a government party sit and look at that figure and then think that the benefits must then be higher?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145234	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145234-2	16 billion kr. is a great deal of money, both at the beginning and at the end of the month, which is why it is also gratifying that employment is increasing among immigrants. I am not standing here saying that people who receive benefits from the Danish cash benefits system are poor. I don't think we have anything to be ashamed of. What I am constantly dealing with is the difference in relation to a cashier, and there I am very concerned that we should not have this difference lifted. There has to be a prize by sitting at the checkout in Bilka on Tuesday night at 9:00. 20.00 and drive peeled tomatoes across the cassette and it must also be a noticeable gain. That is also why we on the part of the Social Democrats have said that we are not just going to abolish the benefits of integration and put everyone on cash aid, because we do not think there is any reason why people who have come to Denmark recently can get an amount that is so close to what a cashier in Bilka gets.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145327	There is a brief comment from Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145332	Thank you so much. Does the Minister not consider that it is a very good principle for foreigners to support themselves and at least not be rewarded if they are not in the labour market?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145343	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145343-2	Well, I think it's a healthy principle that foreigners have to support themselves. I also think it is a healthy principle that Danes should support themselves. We just have to deal with the fact that there are some foreigners and Danes who are unable to do so for various reasons. And especially when it comes to families where there are children, we have to deal with the fact that those children, of course, should not grow up with too many deprivations. We can discuss what too many deprivations are. We believe that the services introduced by the former Blue Government left too many deprivations. We agree that we should not go back to the services of former Prime Minister Mrs Helle Thorning-Schmidt, because there were benefits for somewhere in between we hope that a broad consensus can be reached in the Folketing on the provision of benefits.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145428	Mrs. Mette Thiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145431	Thank you. First of all, I find it rather strange that the Minister seems to think that it is quite the same as you should have whether you are a foreigner or a Dane. I'm kind of puzzled about that. But it is clear, of course, that New Citizens have a clear position that foreigners must support themselves. It is true, as the Minister says, that there are some foreign families where people are still not in work, and then there is also a very special group that we are well aware of, which is what the Minister calls some who have an additional need for integration. But I still find it hard to understand how the Minister thinks this is going to make more people take a job and support themselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145514	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145515	I agree with the parols, but let's just dig one spade in deeper into the substance. The rapporteur says that foreigners must support themselves. Yes, but what if there is a foreigner in Denmark with two children who are unable to support themselves? What if she doesn't actually have a job? What's gonna happen to those two kids? Are they going to live on the street? We agree, I suppose, that they should not, and that is why we need to ensure that there is some level of social benefits for those parents. We can discuss what the level should be... it is a legitimate political discussion... but we can't hold on to that, and I don't think New Citizens can say that people should just lie on the heat grate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145555	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. We thank the Minister. The first rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Rasmus Stoklund, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145606	Thank you. In the Social Democratic Party, we, like the Left, believe that we must make demands on unemployed immigrants. For this reason, in our aliens' initiative we proposed from 2018 to introduce a 37-hour working week for persons with immigrant or refugee backgrounds in the benefit system. The proposal is that if unemployed immigrants are unable to find a job and are therefore in the benefit system, they should benefit from their benefits. In other words, there must be a clearer link between effort and performance and between right and duty. As the comments made in the motion for a resolution also state, shortly after the 2019 elections, we reached an agreement to introduce a temporary family allowance with the aim of ensuring that children do not grow up in poverty. Since then, it has been agreed to extend that grant until June 2022 until an agreement is reached on the basis of the work of the Service Commission. Negotiations are under way in the Ministry of Employment. The problem with the level of benefits for unemployed immigrants is difficult. We must take account of the fact that children do not grow up under unreasonable conditions and, at the same time, ensure that the amount of benefits does not increase the influx to Denmark and, finally, it is an important consideration that there is a benefit from having a job. In view of these considerations, the Social Democrats do not support the resolution. I welcome the SF and the Enhedslist and say that they do not support the resolution either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145728	There is one brief comment. Sir. Morten Dahlin, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145732	Does the Minister think that integration is conducive to rewarding unemployed immigrants for sitting at home with DKK 2,000? extra a month tax-free?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145748	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145749	I mean, it's a slightly simplistic way of setting it up. This is a temporary grant which has been provided to protect some children from child poverty. A little depending on the composition of a family, that's about 700 kroner. per month per year, This is a child. This system does not only apply to foreigners; it also applies to Danish families covered by the legislation on cash benefits.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145820	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145821	But this applies primarily to non-western immigrants, because it is the group that will receive clearly most of this money. And the rapporteur did not really answer my question, which is why I am asking it again: does the Social Democrats believe that it is good for integration to reward unemployed immigrants to stay at home with DKK 2 000? extra each month tax-free?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145850	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145851	But I do not buy the premise that we reward some for staying at home, because our goal is precisely that people should not stay at home. Our goal is for people to go to work. Unfortunately, there are many challenges. There are cultural challenges, and there are, among other things, cultural challenges. was clearly explained after the launch of a new initiative by the City of Copenhagen, which was that the social workers could report when some tried to obstruct e.g. women who tried to get into a job, and then male sidekicks came from the family who sat and said things in Arabic that made the woman end up not getting a job. So there is much more to it than the fact that we are now trying to shield children from child poverty, which is essential to getting people into work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145930	Thank you. There are no more brief comments and we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Kathrine Olldag, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406145950	Thank you. When, in the autumn of 2019, we reached an agreement with the Government, the SF and the Enhedslisten to introduce a new temporary family allowance and cancel the agreed reduction in the integration allowance for parents, it was because it is absolutely fundamental for us to combat poverty. The gap between those who have the most and those who have the least had grown very large and stood to be even greater with the planned cuts in the return service planned by the VLAK government, which this proposal also requires. However, the future of children must not be determined by the economic background or social status of parents. We don't leave those who have the very least on the platform. We have families in Denmark where the money is so small that one fails to eat the three daily meals one fails to buy medicine, and Christmas and birthdays are cancelled because there is no money for gifts. In addition, these families are also affected at this time by increasing heating and electricity bills, like everyone else. And that is why I believe that the Left's proposal here is absolutely without empathy and sense of situation. The Left also knows as well as all of us that growing up in poverty has consequences not only in childhood but also later in life. This can result in lower wages, shorter education and worse employment links, and we in Denmark simply cannot be aware of this. We owe it to all children in Denmark to have equal access to the opportunities we have in Danish society. With the subsidy we introduced in 2019, we reached almost 28,000 children, and that is over 14,000 families. It is worth welcoming and it is not worth tampering with until we have the outcome of the negotiations that are going on around a new system of benefits. The Radical Left, of course, does not support the resolution. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150146	There are no brief comments. I'm sorry, there was just a request for a brief comment. Sir. Morten Dahlin, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150155	Thank you, President. I'm gonna be a little faster to pull in next time. Does the Radical Left believe that integration is promoted when immigrants are not in the labour market but remain at home on passive support?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150212	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150214	No, that is not our general view. Like the Left and all the other parties in here, we know, and can see from the statistics, that some of what is most conducive to integration for both immigrants and Danes, and which is good, is to be in the labour market. Having said that, we do not see that there is any benefit or a great gift in going home on the low benefits that we have today, even after we gave this extraordinary family allowance. After all, we also see that the integration and employment rates of immigrants with a non-western background are increasing in these years. That is why we do not believe that the family allowances we made in 2019 have actually prevented immigrants from entering the labour market with a non-western background. That's not what we can see in the numbers. So the premise that this subsidy is an obstacle to participation in the labour market is simply not in line with reality.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150305	Thank you. Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150308	That gives rise to a number of comments. Radical Left says we have low services here in Denmark. A couple on cash benefits, who are over 30 years of age and have two children, are paid 25,200 DKK each month after tax, and 25,200 DKK every month. is not a low performance. So what the Radical Left is saying is completely decoupled from reality. Does the Radical Left really mean that if you get 25,200 kroner? is the victim of a low-benefit system?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150351	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150353	What puzzles me in this situation is that at a time of high heating bills, and when we have a lot of Ukrainians going to the municipalities and going to be on these services, I know that the rapporteur has a big beating heart for them anyway will deprive them of DKK 2 000. of their very, indeed, incredibly low integration performance or return service, as I believe the Left has also helped to call it. That is what puzzles me in this situation, and that is why I am saying that this proposal represents an extremely bad situation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150427	Now there are no more brief comments. We thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150447	Thank you, President. This question is one of the great classics here in the Folketing, which shows the difference between red immigration policy and blue immigration policy. In fact, I think that when I first stood here on the platform in the summer of 2015, it was precisely to discuss the benefits of integration. In previous years we had seen how the Helle Thorning-Schmidt government's very, very high benefits to people who came here through the refugee system helped to make Denmark one of the most attractive places to seek asylum in Europe. When the Blue Government arrived in 2015, it was one of the things that was first tackled in order to curb the great pressure that was against Denmark, and I stood here on the platform and explained why it was a really good idea, which was because it helped to get the number of people who went up through Europe specifically to seek asylum in Denmark, among other things. because of the high benefits, to fall. And it was partly because we introduced the integration benefit that the number began to decrease. Now we have the Social Democratic Government, which has at least partially and in some areas raised these benefits by means of grants, etc., and everything else equal helps to make Denmark more attractive compared to the migration and asylum flows that migrate across Europe. So in this question we see it one by one in the same way as the Left, and that is why we support the resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150615	There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard, Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150632	Thank you. The Danish People's Party can, by its very nature, fully support the proposal of the Left to abolish the temporary family allowances and implement the reductions in the integration allowance agreed in the 2019 Finance Act with effect from 1 January 2020. The government has introduced a new temporary family allowance, which has been extended, so the real question is how temporary it is. Two out of three of those who receive a higher public service as a result of government policy have a non-western background. As the proposal shows, a single integration benefit recipient with two children receives just over DKr 2,000. extra tax-free every month. This means that a single integration benefit with two children receives in the vicinity of DKr 4,000. more a month than would have been the case if there had been a bourgeois majority in the Folketing. In addition, refugees are exempted from the requirement to earn in the form of a year's income which they must have been in Denmark in order to be entitled to the full benefit, both in respect of family allowances and child and young people's benefits. It is therefore quite a lot of money that we as a family for integration benefit receive without providing anything to society, and it is totally unfair to the Danes who pay the bill. In the ideal world, asylum seekers had no access to seek spontaneous asylum at the borders of Denmark, and in so far as they had, their request for asylum had to be dealt with in a third country where they could then have residence. Denmark's challenge of integrating immigrants from the Third World is simply insurmountable, and therefore it is quite, quite unreasonable that the government and its support parties should raise the benefits to immigrants to the extreme extent that has happened here. We support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150827	Thank you. Mr President, there is one brief comment. Morten Dahlin. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150830	Thank you to Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard for her support. The reason I take the floor is because I found such a small note here in my drawer, where the seniority of the members of the parliament is listed, and there is Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard almost at the top with about 38 years' seniority. That is why I would like to have a fellow parliamentarian with so much experience in evaluating one thing in this debate, and at least I would like to quote something to Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard: "There will be no relaxation in foreign policy. And the benefits won't be paid. Thus said the present Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to B.T. on 10 April 2019, i.e. before the parliamentary elections. With her 38 years of seniority in the Danish Parliament, Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard must be a certain capacity to assess whether something is a breach or not. Will Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard refer to the fact that the benefits have been increased as a serious breach of the promise?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150930	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406150931	Thank you. Yes, I almost get tears in my eyes over the first introduction. But it is a promise, just one of many, and how many times have we not experienced this? How many times have we experienced this? It's one time after another. What about the long list? We can discuss that another time, sir. Morten Dahlin, as the Social Democratic Party joined the election campaign? How many of these proposals have actually been implemented? I actually think we should have a major discussion on that too. So, unfortunately, it is a breach of promise, including from a government that keeps saying that it really wants to tighten foreign policy. But these things just happen a little unseen, you might say, which keeps going again, and that is not just what I have to say, and I just have to say that a social democratic government, because in the past it was also the bourgeois government. But let's make it right. There are two options: let us fix it or live with it. I prefer the first one.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151024	I do not think there were any further comments on this. So we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151041	Foreign policy must be resolved from scratch and foreigners must support themselves. We shall vote in favour of the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151057	Thank you for that and that did not give rise to any brief comments. No more rapporteurs have asked to speak, so that is why we have reached the rapporteur for the proposers. Here you go, sir. Morten Dahlin from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151123	Thank you for that, President. It is a bit disappointing to have to stand here on the platform and to note that there is no support for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Left, and it may well be that I had a little naive hope before today's debate, but I had the hope that the Social Democratic Party, at least, could support it here. 'Cause I could at least read B.T. on 10 April 2019, the Social Democratic Party leader, who has now become Prime Minister, clearly said: "There will be no relaxation in foreign policy. And the benefits won't be paid. Quote out. Unfortunately, however, the opposite has happened. In the autumn of 2019, after the parliamentary elections, the Social Democratic Party reached an agreement with the left to raise the social benefits for immigrants. Now you need almost 300 million. kr. in the year to reward mostly unemployed foreigners. This means that unemployed immigrant families can get 2,000 kroner. extra every eternal single month through the door... well to feel tax-free... with your kind regards... the government. We in the Left, of course, think that this is quite the wrong way to go, especially when we consider that in Denmark we already have very high social benefits. Because we have to remember that we live in a country where a couple over 30 years old with two children receive 25,200 kroner. DKK 25,200 per month paid out. The fact that you can sit and listen to that figure and then enter into an agreement with the very extreme left to increase the benefits simply makes no sense, and that is why we in the Left have tabled this motion for a resolution to roll back the government's increases in public benefits to unemployed immigrants in particular. Our proposal is designed to ensure that more people become part of the working community, that more people support themselves, that will contribute positively to the integration and cohesion of Denmark, and then it is also basically about justice. Because we think that if you come to Denmark from outside, you have an obligation to support yourself and your family. One should not be able to sit back and expect to be supported by Danish taxpayers, but one must enter the labour market and contribute, because if one can go from Mogadishu to Maribo, one can also go down and sit behind the box in the supermarket. And I know that the government and the other left will see our proposal as a punishment, but it is actually exactly the opposite. It is not a punishment to work, but it is healthy, it is good and it is good for you, and it is also very beneficial for your children. Because we know that one of the best things we can do for children here in Denmark is to ensure that they grow up in a home where mother and father get up in the morning and go to work, and therefore it should be the job of any responsible government to ensure that as many as possible become part of the largest community we have in Denmark, namely the working community. I would therefore like to thank the blue parties for supporting our resolution. I should like to express my regret at the resistance of the Red parties, because I still have hopes that even if it is perhaps a naive hope that the government will live up to the promise made by the Prime Minister before the elections, namely that the benefits of unemployed immigrants would not be increased. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151524	Thank you, sir. Morten Dahlin. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Integration. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151538	The debate is open and the first to speak is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151623	Thank you to the President for the floor and thank the authors of the motion for a resolution. After all, it is a proposal in which the proposers want the government to ensure that future specialised asylum centres are not located in densely populated areas. The proposers want the government to ensure greater transparency in the process of the location of specialised asylum centres. I would like to start by saying a few words about the Foreigners' Authority's accommodation practice. The Foreigners' Board is responsible for providing and operating accommodation for asylum seekers and foreigners without legal residence in Denmark. It follows from Paragraph 42 of the Aliens Act. When the board considers that there is a need for the establishment of a specialist asylum centre, the board must, on the basis of a professional assessment, find the best possible accommodation solution and location. The target group for a specialist asylum centre is people who are very caring and caring because of various forms of mental or physical impairment. The assessment of what is the best possible accommodation solution and the location of a special asylum centre shows a number of different conditions. It may be, for example, whether there is another centre nearby so that staff exchanges and training can take place at the centres. It may also be whether there is a treatment offer in the vicinity of the centre so that it is practically easier to treat both residents and staff, or whether the centre has limited interaction with neighbours or a public authority. For me, of course, it is important that there is always a good dialogue with the local community concerned, whether it is a normal asylum centre, whether it is an exit centre or whether what we are talking about today is a special asylum centre. I understand that it is practical when the Foreigners' Agency opens a centre or moves residents between the Danish administration's centres that the Board has a dialogue with the relevant municipalities, just as it is practice that the operator is in charge of the dialogue with citizens from the local area. And it's my impression that this practice is followed by the Foreigners' Board when, for example, the Board of Directors. opens an asylum center or moves residents between the administration centers. So to sum up: The Foreign Affairs Agency has been responsible for the accommodation at Danish asylum centres for many years. It follows from the Aliens Act, and it also applies to the establishment and location of special asylum centres. A possible future location of specialist asylum centres is • and I think it should also be a professional authority decision which I do not think we, as members of parliament, should influence or interfere with. If members of the Folketing think otherwise, of course it is entirely legitimate, but then I think we should discuss section 42 of the Aliens Act. And then, in this Chamber, we have to discuss whether it should be less of a professional judgement and more of a political assessment. We will not support the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151920	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration... Yes, there was just a brief comment. Sir. Christoffer Aagaard Melson, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151934	It's a talk we've had before. But I am a little sad to hear that the Minister is not reflecting a little more on what has gone wrong in this process, so I would like to hear from the Minister whether he thinks that communication with the municipality of Vejle and the citizens of Sandvad has been satisfactory in this matter.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151954	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406151956	I know that there have been critics who believe that the National Council of Foreigners has misled Vejle Municipality. That's not my impression. But I don't think the progress on this case has been good for our ability to secure accommodation for this very specialized group of foreigners. So I also have a wish that, when it comes to finding a new location, we should, in fact, do so now, because the contract with the municipality of Vejle expires in the autumn, then ensure a location and a dialogue with the local area, which means that we do not end up in the same, I think, a little tiresome discussions as there have been in relation to the location in Sandvad.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152047	- Do you want to see him? - Yes, sir. Is Aagaard Melson following a brief remark? Yeah, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152054	I'm sorry for this lack of awareness of how wrong this has been. The municipality has even got Kromann Reumert, the law firm, to look into the matter, and the law firm says that the municipality and the local community have been deceived. Kromann Reumert estimates you live illegally in the lease. So, I do not know whether the Minister can understand if the citizens are sitting out there and think it is relatively violent that it seems to impress a minister at all that a collaborator and a law firm believe that the ministry is acting illegally.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152131	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152132	Well, as I also said in the context of a discussion we held recently on the same subject, it is absolutely essential that no state authority should in any way act illegally. This is, of course, important. But we also just have to deal with the fact that the Foreign Affairs Agency does. That's what I'm gonna have to deal with is the Attorney General's opinion.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152206	Thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. There are no more brief comments. And then we start with the rapporteurs, and the first is the rapporteur for the Social Democratic Party. Sir. Rasmus Stoklund, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152218	Thank you. With this motion for a resolution, the Left proposes that future specialised asylum centres should not be placed in densely built areas. In addition, it is proposed that the government should ensure greater transparency in the process of placement of specialised asylum centres, including prior dialogue with the inhabitants of the communities involved. It is the Foreigners' Agency which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to accommodate asylum seekers, as well as for running accommodation sites. The decision to open a special asylum centre in Sandvad has not been a political decision. It's a decision made by the authorities. Subsequently, the decision has, understandably, given rise to a great deal of debate, including debate on how to take such decisions. I therefore welcome the fact that, in the new tender documents for accommodation of asylum seekers in Sandvad, the Foreigners' Agency has chosen to clarify the environment in which they should be located, namely a location where there is limited interaction with neighbours and other public authorities, at appropriate distance from neighbours and other public authorities. Against this background, I expect that you will not again see examples of places like that in the centre. Social democracy does not support the proposal. I should like to welcome the SF and the Radical Left and say that they do not support the motion for a resolution either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152332	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Christoffer Aagaard Melson.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152336	When you've been close to this process and know how it's going on, for example. A municipality must set up a centre for such a complex target group, so it has been strange, to say the least, to experience how quickly one can set up the company and how few requirements there are for example. engage in dialogue with the local community and that you have some follow-up in terms of quality and what kind of employees it is. So I would like to ask the rapporteur: does the rapporteur not think that is fair, for example? In the case of citizens who are to live in an area where such a centre is being set up for a very complex group, such as: We have committed very violent crime, that there are just about the same requirements for professionalism and security as there are when, for example, there are. a municipality has to set up such a place?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152420	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152421	Indeed, and as far as I understand it, it is also the task of the authorities to ensure that there is a dialogue between the local area and the municipality concerned. And then I think it is essential that it is now clear from the tender conditions in the new tender documents, when a new specialisyl centre is to be set up, that it is placed in a location where there is limited interaction with neighbours and other public opinion, and that it is at appropriate distance from neighbours and other public opinion, so that it is not again seen cases like that in Sandvad, where a local community is exposed to a negative impact.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152502	Sir. Christoffer Aagaard Melson.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152505	After all, it is positive that the rapporteur recognises that what has happened in Sandvad has not been good. But then I want to hear from the rapporteur: what does the rapporteur think about the future of the Foreigners' Agency submitting to the Centre roughly the same kind of supervision as the other locations we have in Denmark, to a similar target group, so as to ensure security and security and professionalism in these offers, which is my claim ■ one has not got the point at all in the present case?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152532	Sir. Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152533	I have no grounds for replying to that. It is, of course, regulated by the Aliens Act, how the authorities are responsible for placing new asylum centres. Now there has been an example here which has been controversial, but in general it has not been a problem when the authorities have placed new asylum centres, and I assume that there is both professionalism and relevant matters that have been taken into account in the legislation that regulates it here. So, on this basis, I have no preconditions for saying here that we have to change the basics.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152607	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment from Mrs Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152610	Thank you so much. I would just like to hear from the rapporteur whether the rapporteur does not find it extremely problematic to place a centre with 14 new residents, according to the information provided by the Extrablade, who could not be accommodated in the ordinary accommodation system, including the exit centre. Among the residents, according to Ekstrabladet's information, nine with treatment sentences, three previously convicted of murder in Denmark, a convicted felony crime on a minor girl, and more than half of the residents are sentenced to expulsion. Does the rapporteur really believe that criminal foreigners should be held to the disadvantage of the Danes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152646	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152647	No, I certainly do not believe that criminal foreigners should be held to the disadvantage of the Danes. I believe that criminal foreigners should be expelled as far as possible. So it is positive that now that a new special asylum centre is to be set up, we can see that we are taking into account that it should be well away from neighbours and that it is fortunately in the foreseeable future that it should be established. After all, it is within a relatively few months.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152719	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152721	Okay, thanks for the answer. Does the rapporteur really think that criminal foreigners who are sentenced to expulsion should be allowed to walk freely in society, or does the rapporteur think, just as the New Citizens do, that that door should be locked because they should not be held in the hands of the Danes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152738	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152740	Where there is a difference between myself and Mrs Mette Thiesen, I think we have an interest in being part of an international community that plays under certain common rules of the game, so that it is not the law of the jungle that prevails. That is why, unlike Mrs Mette Thiesen, I am in favour of our international commitments, which means that in a number of areas we are bound and, for example, we are bound. cannot tell people who have endured a prison sentence that they must remain in prison. But in return, we must do everything we can to get them sent out of Denmark if they have a expulsion sentence.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152817	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Then the rapporteur for the authors of the motion for a resolution has asked to speak in the rapporteur's series. Here you go, sir. Christoffer Aagaard Melson.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406152834	Thank you for the floor. The resolution here stems from the chaotic and problematic course of the transformation of the former nursing home in Sandvad into a special asylum centre last autumn. This was a process which, in our opinion, led to neither an ethical nor a professional solution. We simply need to be able to do better in the future. In brief, both Vejle Municipality and the local community were deceived when they were told at the end of August that in a few months an offer was to be made for vulnerable asylum seekers who needed additional support, among other things. due to physical or mental illness. Neither the municipality nor the residents opposed this, as both the municipality and the community have taken a huge responsibility in accepting asylum seekers for many years. Unfortunately, the reality turned out to be different. Soon thereafter, the media read that the truth was that the centre should contain, among other things. asylum seekers and rejected asylum seekers who, because of mental illness, have committed very serious crime and who, therefore, not only for their own sake but also because of the security of the community, need to be shielded from the community and under 24-hour surveillance. The case is so glaring that the law firm Kromann Reumert, which Vejle Municipality has hired to look at the process on 28 January, concluded that the target group change, which the Foreigners' Board has made in Sandvad, is illegal, since it has undoubtedly provided the landlord with incorrect information. Creating an offer that can accommodate a target audience with such complex and serious challenges as the residents of the center in Sandvad have, is also a task that requires great professionalism and experience. How such a complex offer can be created so quickly without local involvement, and without it even being part of the consideration whether a location in the middle of a village right next to the playground is appropriate, as the Foreigners' Board admitted, when they finally hard pressed into a citizens' meeting at the beginning of November, is very worrying. Perhaps not surprisingly, the result has also proved to be problematic, both for residents who can hardly avoid bumping into the locals if they move outside, although they need quiet and to be shielded from the community, and for the residents of Sandvad, who have experienced a number of unpleasant incidents, and who obviously experience a huge insecurity in the situation. Our claim is that this group of citizens would never have ended up in the former nursing home in Sandvad if there had been an openness about the process and if the offer had not been targeted asylum seekers. The requirements for the Foreigners' Board in relation to the professional standards and thoroughness, security and involvement of the local community are simply not close to the same requirements as there are for example. a municipality that will create a similar offer for such a challenged audience. This needs to be corrected so that neither a community like Sandvad nor the residents of the centre in the future find themselves in a similar situation. We had actually hoped that the Minister would have come to our attention and had recognised that there should be a thorough look at how we could avoid a similar process and a similar situation in the future, so this resolution would have been superfluous. Unfortunately, he has not been willing to do so. However, we will acknowledge that last week we were told that it is now being written into the new tender that the offer in question should not be close to the city in the future. That is why, of course, we also hope that the Minister will choose to support our motion for a resolution, which, frankly, does not go very far, as we have not gone further than proposing that dialogue with the local community should be required in the future and that a future settlement for such a challenged target group as is the case here should not be placed in densely built areas. Such a location is, as has been said, very problematic both for residents and for the local community. Alternatively, we hope that we can agree on a report that will ensure a much better and more professionally sound process when similar offers are being created in the future under the auspices of the Foreigners' Authority, in exactly the same way as we have had new rules introduced when this kind of offer is to be created under local authority. Finally, I would like to call on the Minister once again to speed up the move. We see it as a recognition that a new invitation to tender is being written in, that this centre should be outside a city; recognition that it is professionally irresponsible that it lies where it lies in Sandvad, that is, the present offer. In addition, there is both a law firm and a municipality that believes that the Foreigners' Authority has acted illegally. The only reason why they are not prosecuting the Foreigners' Board is that there is 18 months of waiting in the housing court, and therefore it does not make sense for them to spend taxpayers' money on a case that does not even get to court before the lease has been terminated. So with the two reasons, we think that there is every reason why the Minister should try to see whether it cannot be speeded up as much as possible, that we should find a new place that both citizens and residents are professionally safe and secure. Thank you for the floor. I look forward to a good debate on this important issue, hopefully, so that we can find a good solution before it goes wrong somewhere like Sandvad.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153325	Thank you. There are no brief comments to the rapporteur of the Left, so we go further in the rapporteur's line. The next rapporteur is from the Enhedslisten. Here you go, Mrs. Rosa Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153340	Thank you. I can say quite briefly that the Enhedslisten does not support this resolution, and we do not, because we do not think that it is the Folketing that should decide where these centres should be located. I think it is all very well to draw up guidelines on how things are to be and on how we set up the financial framework, but to go in and run in detail where the centres are to be located, I do not think that the Folketing should. However, I would also like to say that no matter where we place these special asylum centres, there will be some who complain about it or who will be sad that they are just in their backyard or just close to them. I think that there is something wrong with the very construction of the way we run these centres. Should we not, in fact, rather work with smaller units so that many asylum seekers were not collected in one place, but spread it out more? At any rate, I think it gives some thought to the fact that every time we have a debate on asylum centres in particular, wherever we put them, there will be a mayor or some citizens sitting there and being really sad or sad that it was precisely with them. I think that there is something wrong with the construction. It's just a little side comment. But the Enhedslisten cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153507	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Sir. Christoffer Aagaard Melson.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153511	I am, of course, sorry about that, but then I want to hear Enhedslisten, whether Enhedslisten can't follow our surprise that you have quite different professional standards and safety standards in relation to placing such a target group here, because it is asylum seekers than you would have had if it were now Danish citizens who were placed in a place because they, for example, had been arrested. had killed people or committed felony crimes. There, the municipality would have to go through a long, long process where everything had to be managed in relation to professional and educational approaches, security, community involvement. Does the rapporteur not agree that there is a strange dissertation here? When it is asylum seekers, you can place them in a place where there is a very, very great risk that things will go wrong if they come out because there is such a great chance that they will come out and meet ordinary citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153600	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153601	Yes, I can understand that, but as I understand it, what can be said is that the very specific situation of the asylum centre which should be located in Sandvad is not criminal, but it is asylum seekers who have special needs, which are therefore very, very ill, or who require some special treatment. I think it actually speaks very well in the debate on foreign policy in general that asylum seekers are consistently referred to as criminals, even if they are not.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153628	Sir. Christoffer Aagaard Melson.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153630	Well, I don't know: Well, when you're convicted they're supposed to be here as part of a conviction because they've committed something criminal, and because they're so mentally ill that they need a place where they can get treatment, you can't say they're not criminals. Now this is being read into another debate, but I was hoping that one could at least get through to Enhedslisten in order to say that both professionally and in terms of security we should not make a difference as to whether it is asylum seekers or Danes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153656	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153657	Certainly, if you have a conviction, you are a criminal, of course, until you have endured your punishment. After you've endured your sentence, you're done being a criminal. So that is the way I think the rapporteur of the Left is right. However, I would like to say that I understand the dilemma that lies here. What is our concern exactly in the motion for a resolution is that the Folketing should now go in and decide where these centres should be located. However, I agree so far along the way that there should of course be the same standards. I agree with that. But what I read into the resolution is that the main objective is for the Folketing to decide where the centres are to be located, and we disagree with that. However, we would very much like to be involved in discussing the other issues in committee.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153741	Thank you to Mrs Rosa Lund. There are no more brief comments, so we shall move on to the rapporteur of the Conservative Group, Mr Conservatives. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153748	Thank you, President. I am very pleased that the Left has tabled this motion for a resolution. We have also fought together in a very good enquiry debate, where there were a great many citizens from Sandvad who had arrived, not surprisingly, because this is an absurd example of how there has been no citizen involvement at all; how one suddenly places a special asylum centre in the middle of a city and leaves the inhabitants with the impression that there are no criminals at all, where reality is quite different. These are extremely harsh criminals with very, very violent convictions. The centre is located near a playground and near a bus stop. And the most absurd thing is to call in a guard, not to protect the inhabitants, but to protect the residents of the center. So I understand that the many Sandvad citizens who had come to that question debate a few months ago feel so deeply disappointed in the government. And in those words, I would like to thank the Left for having tabled this resolution, which Conservatives of course wholeheartedly support.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153855	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you, Mr President. Marcus Knuth. Then it is the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. Pia Kjærsgaard Thank you, but first take the next rapporteur). Then we start with Mrs. Mette Thiesen from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406153923	Let us be honest: it creates massive insecurity in the Danes, because politicians will not ensure that dangerous criminal foreigners are expelled and imprisoned. At the exit centres around Denmark they can waltz in and out as they please. They live only formally at the center, but in reality they continue their criminal lives around the country. Politicians are very concerned about the rights of criminal foreigners, but frankly, what about the rights of Danes? Exiled criminal foreigners simply should not be allowed to walk freely around. They must stay in a place where there is only one door out, and that is the door out of Denmark. However, neither the present Socialist nor the previously left-wing government had the will to do more than the junk of a patchy solution, such as that of the United States. Kærshovedgård is. And now we have seen an example of a so-called special asylum centre, Sandvad, which, on paper, was supposed to accept particularly vulnerable asylum seekers, but which was supposed to accept sensuality and rape criminals. That is totally unacceptable. Because of an interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, politicians in both the Left and the Social Democratic Party believe that we cannot afford to put a lock on the gate in, for example, the United Kingdom. The exit centres to secure the Danes from the criminal aliens. I simply do not think that we can afford the Danes not to do so. Instead of ignoring a blatantly foolish interpretation of human rights, politicians would rather expose Danes to the ravages of criminal foreigners. It is therefore time for Danish politicians to learn to think and act independently on the basis of common sense rather than subjecting themselves to foolish decisions by a court abroad. We can treat deported criminal foreigners properly and securely at a closed center until they choose to go back where they come from. The same goes for the criminal foreigners, who hopefully are just waiting to be expelled. It is neither inhumane nor unjust; on the contrary, it is justice to the Danes. In short, one patch solution after another has been made. The only right thing is to secure a new asylum system and stop spontaneous asylum; to ensure that foreigners in Denmark support themselves and that criminals are consistently expelled and after the first sentence. Exiled and criminal aliens must be placed at an exit center until they want to travel out. There must be only one door in that exit centre, and that is the door out of Denmark. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406154225	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you to Mrs Mette Thiesen. Then it is the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. Here you go, Mrs. Pia Kjærsgaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406154241	Thank you. The Danish People's Party basically believes that it should not be possible to seek spontaneous asylum in Denmark. To the extent that you still show up in Denmark and ask for asylum, they should be referred to treatment in a third country, and we are of course curious about how it is going to work out, because we have heard a lot about it, where those who are entitled to it should have a residence permit. If Denmark and the Danish Parliament implemented such a proposal, this would be unnecessary. It is also the view of the Danish People's Party that, if asylum seekers perpetrate and are convicted of crime in Denmark, their request for asylum should be rejected immediately and the asylum seekers deported by Denmark. In 2019 1,209 asylum seekers were charged with crime. These are 1,209 cases which should immediately have been closed and those expelled from Denmark, regardless of what international conventions say on that matter. It is deeply, deeply offensive to the Danes that you experience foreigners coming to Denmark, requesting asylum and committing crime as thanks for free shelter and support. This applies to the residents of Sandvad, the residents of Bording and all the other Danes who are having their daily lives ruined as a result of the fact that the nearest neighbours are asylum centres where asylum seekers cannot figure out how to behave properly, and it is extremely unpleasant, to put it mildly, to be next door to an asylum centre with criminal foreigners. What did you do at Kærshovedgård? I find it quite embarrassing that financial compensation should be provided for having criminal asylum seekers nearby. Therefore, it was also a good idea to place criminal and dangerous exiles on the island of Lindholm. We had to do something, and it would have been better if there had not been ferry service from the island, that is, if it had really been an island where they could be placed. It could also be in Greenland, as the Danish People's Party has proposed in order, of course, but there is no majority for that. Once again, it is the European Convention on Human Rights that is in the way of Denmark not being able to protect its own citizens from abuses by criminal foreigners. Of course, it is not a good idea to place asylum centres for criminal foreigners in densely built areas; it is actually not a good idea to place asylum centres for criminal foreigners anywhere in Denmark. The only good place to place criminal foreigners in is in their home country, and the Danish People's Party will work hard for that to be the solution. That is why, of course, we support this proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406154528	Thank you to Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard. Then we have finished the rapporteur's series and the rapporteur for the proposers has asked to be allowed to round the debate. Here you go, sir. Christoffer Aagaard Melson.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406154544	Thank you for the debate, and thank you for your kindness in various ways. We hope that what comes out of this very, very sad matter is that others will not find themselves in the same situation and that they will not repeat the mistakes and that they will learn from it from the Minister and the Foreign Affairs Authority, so that they treat the citizens with the same orderly treatment as they do elsewhere in the public sector and, as I have said, they do when they set up an offer as a municipality for a similar challenged target group. There are not so many of them in Denmark, because not many have such violent judgments behind them as this target group has and are placed for the same reasons. But what we hope to get out of it without having to have the big debate, because we are also in favour of compliance with the conventions, is that, within the conventions, we simply have to go professionally to this target group and make sure that they end up in a place that is both professionally sound and where we can also defend the way in which people in the area are treated, and this requires, among other things, that we are honest with them and that we enter into dialogue with them, with regard to what challenges there can be, and then my experience is that the citizens actually want a lot of things. We have seen this in the municipality of Vejle, where Sandvad has taken a huge responsibility for integrating refugees, welcomed asylum seekers, but the process has, of course, completely failed because of the way in which they have been treated and because a very, very bad decision has been taken, which had never been taken, if one had been under the regime and supervision that there is, for example, when. other authorities must set up similar places. I hope that the Minister and the system will learn from this matter and that we will find, as soon as possible, a professional solution for these citizens, where there will of course have to be a different process than there has been with Vejle Municipality and with the local area in this matter. So thank you for the debate, and I hope that this will end with something good coming out of it, where we will have a better solution both for those residents who are very ill and have therefore committed something very criminal, and the citizens the new place in the local area where these citizens end up. So thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406154751	Thank you, sir. Christoffer Aagaard Melson. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Integration. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406154804	The debate is open and the first to speak is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406154830	Thank you, Mr President. With this motion for a resolution, the authors propose to amend the rules for periods of employment in connection with the granting of Danish citizenship. It is proposed that any violation of the penal code should result at least in a waiting period of 41⁄2 years before a person can become a Danish citizen. It is also proposed that fines of more than DKK 10,000 be imposed. must result in a waiting period of 9 years. It is less than a year since we concluded a new agreement on Danish citizenship. Our agreement states, among other things, that the granting of citizenship should take place on the basis of strict requirements and thus be reserved for those who have chosen Denmark and basic Danish values and legal principles, learned our language, which has not committed serious crime, and which has integrated into and wants to be an active part of Danish society. The agreement included: The requirement of good repute has been tightened up so that any prison sentence, conditional or unconditional, excludes a person from becoming a Danish national, that certain fines provide for longer waiting periods before a person can become a Danish national, and that the rules for persons who repeatedly commit carnage crimes were tightened. To the examples given by the authors of the motion for a resolution, of crime and of the waiting periods which it triggers, I can say: yes, it may appear that repeated cases of shoplifting, which do not result in fines of more than DKr 3 000, do not give Karen's and that very large fines, if they are not granted after, for example, one of them. The law on aliens or the law on drugs can mean a waiting period of 41⁄2 years. But the Karen rules that we have jointly laid down in matters of citizenship are precisely a balance between the gravity of crime on the one hand and the consequence that it must have of an application for citizenship on the other. I appreciate our deal. It is an agreement in which we were made clear that the granting of Danish citizenship is something which must, of course, be earned, and I believe that with the agreement we found an appropriate level in relation to crime, and the government cannot support the proposal on that basis. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155035	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Sir. Marcus Knuth, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155038	Thank you, Minister. We are very pleased with our new agreement on citizenship, but there is no agreement that is perfect. Now it is almost a year ago that we made the agreement, and we see, unfortunately, even though we tightened up in a number of areas, that what can be called serial criminals at a lower level, especially when it comes to criminal law; people who repeatedly commit theft still get Danish citizenship. Some people seem to think that is acceptable, and because they are just below the 3,000 DKK fine limit, there is zero as in zero consequence in relation to seeking citizenship. Does the Minister really think that's okay?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155118	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155119	I would say that there is consistency on the part of the courts. The question is whether there should be consistency in relation to the possibility of obtaining citizenship. Of course, we do, but we have to set some de minimis threshold, because we all agree that very small offences should not trigger very long waiting times. Of course, you can always discuss where that bar should lie. I think we found a good level when we tightened the rules not so terribly long ago.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155152	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155153	After all, politics is the art of compromise, so will the Minister try to get to us by saying that in a minor violation of the criminal code there is a lower waiting period which could be 2 or 3 years? Will the Minister agree to that? And I am saying that in the light of the fact that, for example, when it comes to the question of human rights, we are not going to do anything about it. drug crime, there is no tolerance, so for any fine for drug crime there is a waiting period of 41⁄2 years, I think it is. But in the penal code, there's this little limit of DKK 3,000 that some people use to commit crimes over and over again. So will the Minister come to our attention and say: fine, because there is a shorter waiting period for these infringements?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155232	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155233	I fully agree that politics is the art of compromise, and the round of negotiations we were through when we made the new rules for granting citizenship was also a compromise. And I certainly believe and hope that all the parties involved in the agreement can see themselves in different places. At least we can do that on the part of the Social Democrats and the government. So my experience is that we have been bowing to each other quite recently and that there is no reason to reopen the agreement shortly after the conclusion of a new agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155300	There are no more brief comments. Thank you, Minister. Then it is the turn of the rapporteurs and the first rapporteur is from the Social Democratic Party. Sir. Lars Aslan Rasmussen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155317	With this motion for a resolution, the Conservative People's Party instructs the government to call for negotiations to remove the de minimis limit for breaches of the penal code, so that any violation of the penal code, regardless of the amount of the fine in future, will result in a waiting period of 4 years and 6 months. In addition, it is proposed to tighten up the rules for the Karen period in relation to fines of more than DKK 10,000, so that in future it will result in a double waiting period of 9 years. In the Social Democratic Party we would like to thank the Conservatives for presenting this resolution, because we also believe that we should have very strict rules for people who want to become Danish citizens. That is why last year, together with the Conservatives, the Left and the Liberals, we made a sensible and much needed tightening up of the rules of citizenship. With the agreement, we were able to ensure that, if you have an unconditional or conditional judgment, you cannot obtain Danish citizenship as a starting point. In addition, we introduced an employment requirement and made a large number of other restrictions on the rules. As last year's birthright agreement has only recently entered into force, we would like to wait and see how this tightening up is going to work in practice before we start looking at further changes to the birthright circular. At present, we believe that the current rules in this area reflect an appropriate level. That is why the Social Democrats do not support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155431	There is a brief comment. Sir. Marcus Knuth, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155435	Thank you to the rapporteur. Now I asked the minister in relation to people who commit serial crime just below the fine of DKK 3,000, without having any consequence. But the second part of the proposal here is that there is exactly the same waiting period for fines over DKr 3 000. The rapporteur may recall a case in which someone had been fined more than DKK 350,000, and the waiting period is exactly the same as for someone who is fined DKK 3 000. We don't think that's proportional. Can the rapporteur support us in saying that if it is the case that a very large fine is imposed, then there must be a longer waiting period than for a fine of, for example, a fine of... 3,000 kroner.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155513	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155514	But we have just reached a settlement with the Conservative People's Party as well. I know, sir. Marcus Knuth says it's already been a year. But it is also fine to see the effects of it. And I'm thinking that there may also be some cases... I think so too, sir. Marcus Knuth himself has sometimes seen where there may be some attenuating circumstances that make you have been fined less, as the Conservatives sometimes understand. At least I read that in the press. And if we adopt this, it will mean that such a person will never be able to obtain Danish citizenship, i.e. if he has run without light on the bike or the like and received several fines. But as a starting point, you cannot obtain Danish citizenship. You still don't want to be able to do that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155550	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155553	Yes, but that is precisely why we agree on this, and I think we agree on this across the Social Democratic Party and the Conservatives, we are pleased that we have the Committee on the Rights of the Child, where we can, of course, grant exemptions in cases where it may be wrong. However, the rapporteur considers it acceptable that a fine of DKK 3 000 should be imposed. triggers exactly the same waiting period as a fine of DKK 350,000.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155613	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155614	Well, I think it depends a little on what the reason is. I don't agree with you, sir. Marcus Knuth also repeatedly asks the Minister that you can be a serial criminal and that it does not really have any consequence. But it does. For that means, the vast majority of people here will not come near a Danish citizenship. Then there may be a few where you have the opportunity to apply for a derogation. But I really think the rules are fair. And I think that the Conservatives thought so a year ago when we reached this settlement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155638	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. Then it is the rapporteur on the Left, Mr. Morten Dahlin. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406155656	Thank you for that, President. In the Left we want quite basically strict rules for becoming a Danish citizen. Danish citizenship is indeed a gift, perhaps even the finest gift one can get from Danish society. For this very reason, we were also very much involved in tightening the requirements when last year we reached a new agreement on the rules for obtaining citizenship here in Denmark. For example: we agreed that any prison sentence, conditional or unconditional, as a starting point means permanent exclusion from being able to become a Danish citizen. At the same time, we tightened the so-called Karen rules, i.e. how long you have been quarantined from becoming a citizen if you have been fined. We got the rules tightened, so anyone who gets a fine of over 3,000 kroner. For negative social control, violation of the Aliens Act or social fraud, a career period of six years is granted. But what about other types of crime where you get a fine? Does it just go unseen? No, of course not. A fine of DKK 3,000. or more shall result in a waiting period of 4 years and 6 months. Drunk driving penalties result in a four-year and six-month waiting period, regardless of the amount of the fine. And fines for the violation of the law on drugs result in a six-year waiting period, regardless of the amount of the fine. At the same time, the agreement of last year ensured that the Karen period would be tightened up in such a way that people who have committed several offences would have their waiting period extended by what corresponds to the waiting period for each repeat case, and so it is equally important whether it is not the same offence for which they are fined. On the initiative of the Left, we were also able to establish that in future the period of waiting is calculated, from the day the fine is settled and paid, and not as before from the time of the deed itself. We therefore think that we had a very good agreement and some sensible tightenings that ensure that people who commit serious crime are excluded from obtaining Danish citizenship, while people who receive fines also have a consequence. With this motion for a resolution, the Conservative People's Party then proposes that we abolish the de minimis limit so that all criminal offences, including fines of less than DKr 3 000, must result in a waiting period of 4 years and 6 months. At the same time, it is proposed that the Karen period be doubled with all kinds of fines of more than 10,000 kr., so that the waiting period is 9 years. So we agree with some of the intentions behind parts of the proposal. That is why we ourselves proposed, before the negotiations on new rules of Danish citizenship last year, that there should be a harder consequence on people who were fined for example. violations of the Aliens Act. We must also note that it may seem a little strange that people who get a number of smaller fines, for example. five fines of DKK 2,000 are not met with a waiting period, while a person who gets a fine of DKK 3,000. There is also a point in discussing whether greater fines should not lead to a different sanction than smaller fines. So you hit this proposal with the right balance? Are all the nuances included? Is this the smartest way to do this? Is that proportional? We're not so sure about that. Because the consequence, if this proposal is adopted as it stands here, will be that a number of inappropriate things will arise. For example, the proposal would result in a fine of DKK 2,500. In order to break the order it may be that if you refuse to comply with the instructions of the police it does not result in a waiting period, while a fine for breach of the penal code will automatically result in a waiting period, even if the offence is not really greater. We're not so sure that's smart. In other words, the proposal here needs an extra trip to the workshop. We would therefore like the government to call for an evaluation of the new rules on the granting of citizenship, where we could discuss some of the elements that the Conservatives are bringing to our attention here today. That is why we would like to call on the Minister to commit himself to such an evaluation, in which a discussion of these elements could also take place. We could, for example, draw up a joint report on this if the will is there. It is thus passed on as an invitation. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160136	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160138	Of course, I had hoped that the Left would vote in favour, but I am really, really glad that the Left can see itself in large parts of it. We are not saying that this proposal is one hundred per cent perfect, but it underlines that there are some imbalances, and I am sure that the rapporteur himself can remember the case, where someone had been fined five consecutively for large-scale theft, but there was no consequence, because each time the fines were just under DKr 3 000. I very much welcome the fact that the Minister is calling for a debate in which we make some minor adjustments, because, as I said, there is no agreement that is perfect. So I would very much like to go along with the Left on that, and then I hope we can sit down and look at which parts of this proposal the Left can see itself in, and hopefully come to an agreement there and then stand together on it. So that was actually more of a comment to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160231	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160233	Thank you very much, sir. Marcus Knuth. I would say that if we have committed extensive theft, I think we should look at our legislation and what penalties we are actually granting to people who, for example, commit theft. Because if, as the rapporteur says, large-scale theft has been committed on several occasions, we should not let go of a fine of DKK 2 000. There we could then call on another minister who is not here today, the Minister for Justice, to take the initiative to try to see if we do not punish too gently and too gently in a large number of areas here in Denmark. That is certainly a view we have in the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160326	Thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160334	Thank you very much. When we talk about carnage periods, for example, we want to talk about carnage periods. already at a fine of DKK 3,000. be excluded from having citizenship for 41⁄2 years, so the rhetorical question is: Does it make sense to expand the area of Karen's? The Radical Left does not think so. In fact, new research shows that citizenship means education and jobs. It is both logical and intuitively true that citizenship promotes integration, but now there is also research into it. The study compared two groups of non-western immigrants in the period 1995-2020. One group of immigrants was granted citizenship in the period 1995-1999, while the other group remained not Danish citizens in 2020. When the two groups are compared, this is due to the fact that today we have to meet a number of requirements in order to be able to become a national, among other things. one must be able to be Danish and self-supporting. So the people who today can acquire Danish citizenship are already living up to a large number of requirements which indicate that only the most resourceful and integrated acquire Danish citizenship. This is not necessarily the case for those who acquired citizenship in the 1990s, where there were not so many requirements for Danish citizenship. So as far as the group back in the 1990s is concerned, it shows that obtaining citizenship itself means more often taking an education and getting into a job. The beneficial effect is most evident in women and Muslims. The same can be said for moving the top tax limit. It also has the greatest effect on women. The last comment is as much as one way of making a comparison. With those words, the Radical Left does not support the resolution, and I also welcome the SF, which is unfortunately prevented from being here, and say that they cannot support the proposal either. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160559	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160601	Thank you. I certainly did not expect the debate on equality to become part of this resolution. But does the rapporteur really believe that it makes a difference whether it is a man or a woman who has repeatedly committed theft for just under DKr 3 000??
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160618	No, but it is very interesting that this research points out that obtaining citizenship has a beneficial effect also at a time in the 1990s, when there were other conditions for obtaining citizenship and that the beneficial effect of obtaining citizenship has been mostly felt by women, and I also mentioned that it is most important for women to move the top tax limit.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160651	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160652	Well, then, I just have to ask directly about the proposal as it stands here. I have given the example, and I am sure the rapporteur will remember it from the Committee on the Rights of the Child, with a person, of course anonymous, who had been sentenced five times over and over again to commit large-scale thefts just below the threshold of what triggers Karen's. Does the rapporteur think it right that this person should in no way be affected by a waiting period, despite the fact that a person who has committed theft and received a penalty for more than DKr 3 000 should be subject to a caring rule at first instance?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160722	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160724	It is simply a matter of opinion. And we in the Radical Left also think that we must also look at the proportionality of what we have done and what effect it should have. That doesn't just apply in this area, but in all cases. And I can well understand that Conservatives, who have a different approach, also want other options in the negotiations that may be called by the Minister at some point in time. So no, we do not think it should have any meaning in this way. We would much rather look at the beneficial effect of acquiring citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160811	Thank you to the radical rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Kristian Thulesen Dahl from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406160830	On behalf of the Danish People's Party, I think it is a very good initiative that has been taken with this motion for a resolution. I mean, getting Danish citizenship must, by its very nature, be a gift. Having another country's citizenship is an incredible honour to be awarded, so when foreigners come here to Denmark and after a period want to be Danish citizens and apply for it, one must of course meet some basic requirements. And that is not only the case when you take the values of our country to heart and can see yourself in them, so that you do not become such a fifth column business within the country, but it must also be the case that in the way you act, you have shown that you actually want Denmark, and in that it is also included that you do not commit crime. So the starting point for us is, of course, that when you commit crime, then the possibility of citizenship disappears. And then there is the discussion about whether there should be some trivial limit; there are some things that may be so small that they say that it should not be forever and forever that one has lost the right to citizenship. There has been an agreement that we are not part of in the past. We also think it should be laid down, for example. a maximum of how many people can become citizens every year, so we have a little bit more control over it. In other words, we know historically that citizenship has been given where people have been too generous, so that too many have acquired Danish citizenship. So you have also come to give citizenship to many people, whom I think you are hoping there is a broad majority here in the Danish Parliament who share the view that citizenship would not have been given at all if you had looked at it with today's spectacles on and seen what it has done to Danish society. So we are just not in that agreement, but of course we think it is a good thing if parties that have otherwise been involved in agreements, including at the latest in the area of citizenship, can see that there are some things that work inappropriately and would like the conditions tightened. And now, quite specifically, there is the proposal from the Conservatives, which is about the fact that the trivial limit we have today can actually function quite inappropriately, by then getting a large number of fines which are below the de minimis threshold and which, overall, do not sum up to being either denied access or given a waiting period. I think, of course, that it is a good thing that we will then try to get it taken up among the parties responsible for the current legislation on citizenship, so that some of these inappropriate things can then be removed. And although we in the Danish People's Party will not think that it is quite good enough, in relation to what we should do in such an optimal way, when it comes to setting a maximum number of people for how many people can get citizenship every single year, we naturally support the initiative taken with this and think it is very good that it has been done and we have had and have the debate here in Parliament today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406161112	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no brief comments. The next on the platform is Mrs Mette Thiesen from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406161127	Unfortunately, it will also be necessary for us in the new citizens to say no to the agreement that has been made to tighten the rules for granting citizenship to foreigners. I was the one who negotiated for New Citizens, and I attended numerous meetings and fought for the right of the Danes to live in freedom and security, but unfortunately the majority did not want to tackle the root of the nettle and solve the problems from scratch. Of course, we support a tightening of the rules contained in this proposal, but that is still not good enough. For many years the politicians have given far too many Danish citizenship, which should never have had it. For example: A young man from Iraq was granted Danish citizenship only in 2017 in order to commit a violent rape against a young woman who he maimed in the most terrible way. As a foreigner he could have been expelled; as a newly elected Danish citizen he is untouchable and allowed to stay. That is not acceptable. As a minimum, we must demand that Danish citizenship be granted on condition that serious crime is avoided. Neither will the other parties. The minimal tightening in this area means that you must be both a gang member and a terrorist in order to be condemned again, and that is therefore too narrow. It will not protect us from having to house criminals raped, maimed and killed forever. Ideally, in New Citizens we would have put a plug in the hole, so Denmark completely stops granting Danish citizenship to immigrants from Muslim countries, when we can see in the statistics that they and their descendants are over-represented in the crime statistics. The reference to Denmark's international obligations is again and again in the birthright agreement, thus limiting the need for reasonable restrictions to ensure the safety and security of the Danes. We have been working for a long time to ensure that the politicians of the Danish Parliament on the Committee on the Rights of the Child should take each individual applicant into a conversation to make sure that the immigrant, who is going to have Danish passports, is also Danish right into the heart. This could be done if, at the same time, a ceiling were set on the number of new citizenships, so that instead of thousands they would only be given to the few hundred best among applicants who would benefit Denmark. Nor was there a majority in favour of this in a consistent way. There was no mention whatsoever of setting a ceiling on the allocation. Finally, in the negotiations, we tried to persuade the others that we in the Parliamentary Assembly vote on each candidate or, at least, divide them into several legislative proposals instead of lumping them together with two votes a year, in which we are forced either to vote 'yes' to everyone or 'no' to everyone. A separate vote on each candidate would give us in New Citizens an opportunity to vote in favour of those of the applicants who will be good Danes and whom we would like to let into the national community of values. Neither would the majority. New citizens will continue to vote no twice a year when citizenship comes up in the Folketing. We are quite honest that we would rather say no to everyone than give a yes that gives citizenship to the next criminal or violent Islamist. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406161504	Thank you to the rapporteur of the new citizens. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. Marcus Knuth of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406161519	Thank you, sir. President. After all, the minister is right that we made a very good overall agreement last April, but there is no agreement that is perfect. Now we have had a year to see the result, among other things. We are on the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and we see, unfortunately, that we continue to grant Danish citizenship to those I would call serial criminals at a low level. I've mentioned the person who had five as in five! And all the other things being equal, if a person has received five sentences for extensive theft, one can at least think about how many times that person has committed crime without being caught and received a conviction. The proposal here is actually very simple and is inspired by the part of our citizenship circular that concerns drug convictions. There is zero tolerance, so that any conviction for drug crime automatically triggers a waiting period. Another gap, as we see in the existing circular, is in relation to waiting periods when it comes to the amount of the fine. As I have said, I have used the example of a person who is fined exactly DKr 3 000, having a waiting period of 41⁄2 years, while a person who is fined DKr 350,000 gets exactly the same waiting period. We do not think that is right either. That is why we are very sorry that the Social Democrats cannot support this proposal. I think I heard a small opening from the Minister, as regards if it were a fine of less than DKr 3 000, perhaps a shorter waiting period could be looked at. In any case, we would very much like to discuss this, even if the Minister did not close an agreement in this way from the platform. In the same vein, I would like to call on the Minister to remind the Minister for Justice that, before the whole corona crisis broke out, I think there was a plan to make a new move in relation to shoplifting. That's one of them. some of the things that affect this, because out in the retail industry there are really, really big concerns about large-scale organised shoplifting, which really is a burden for many, especially smaller shops that are hard hit. And there I think that the Social Democrats had a stake on the road, precisely in cooperation with the retail industry, and I think that it has been kicked a little to the corner. Everything else equal goes a part of our concerns to people who commit organised repeated shoplifting, but who, because the fines are so low today, do not come under our circular here. So I would urge the Minister to do so. Now the Left is not here, but of course I had hoped that the Left would vote in favour of the proposal like the New Civil and Danish People's Party. However, we warmly welcome the proposal for a talk with the Minister about minor adjustments to the birthright circular. And in those words I would like to thank you for a good and proper debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406161830	Thank you very much to the rapporteur for the authors. No one has asked for the floor. And since it is not, the debate is closed. I propose that the motion for a resolution be referred to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406161854	The debate is open, and we shall first give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406161912	Thank you, Mr President, and thank the authors of the motion for a resolution. 162. The proposal is intended to introduce a fee for re-application in the cases of naturalisation. At the same time, it is proposed that the fee should correspond to the first application fee. I agree with the proposers that there is a need to introduce a fee for re-applications, but I think it should be considered whether the first re-application should not be free of charge and that the re-application fee should be less than the application fee. The government therefore agrees with the Conservatives that a reapplication fee should be introduced. However, we do not entirely agree on how the system should be designed. That is why I am also thinking that it is best that we first agree on the design of such a new re-application fee in the contracting circle behind the birthright agreement, and then we will be able to deal with a possible legislative proposal in this Chamber. The government cannot therefore support the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162030	Thank you very much. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162032	As we agreed before, sir. Minister, politics is the art of compromise, and this time I am extremely pleased that it seems that we can actually meet each other in a kind of compromise. Of course, we had hoped that the Minister would support the motion for a resolution as it stands, but I am very pleased that the Minister can see that there is some bias when there is no charge, because the second, third or fourth time is being sought, that is to say, that it is indirectly exploited by people who, obviously in advance, not least on the basis of convictions of serious crime, know that they do not get Danish citizenship. So I would like to welcome our forthcoming meeting, which I understand the Minister will call, in other words, a talk about how we can make this adjustment. Is that how it's supposed to be understood?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162119	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162120	Yeah, that's how it's supposed to be understood. I imagine the next time we meet in the contract circle, we'll have the first discussion about this. We must remember that most people who apply for citizenship live up to the conditions, they pay their fees, and I think that right now they are waiting too long. And they should not wait too long because there are people seeking fifth, sixth or seventh time, although the people have been denied and have not responded in relation to the reasons why they have been denied in the first place. Because then you simply delay the process, I think, and all those who comply with the conditions, who pay their fees and who have made sure that they comply with the conditions before submitting their application will suffer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162201	Here you go, Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162204	Then I would just like to say a word of thanks to the Minister for being accommodating, and we look forward to the meeting, where hopefully we will also be able to discuss some of the other adjustments, for example. the proposal from before, which the Left in any case also proposed to want to have a talk about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162217	You're welcome. I look forward to discussing the introduction of a fee for re-applications.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162226	Then we say thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. The next speaker is Mr. Lars Aslan Rasmussen from the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162241	Thank you. With this motion for a resolution, the Conservative People's Party is proposing to initiate a legislative amendment to ensure that each re-application for Danish citizenship after refusal is subject to a fee corresponding to the initial application fee. In the Social Democratic Party we think it is reasonable that a fee should be paid when people of foreign origin apply for Danish citizenship. This fee has been raised on a few laps in recent years. In the context of the 2018 birthright agreement, it was agreed between the parties to raise the fee from DKK 1,200. for DKr 3,800, among others. As a result of the new constitutional ceremonies, some additional expenses were incurred. In addition, the fee was also slightly increased last year when we concluded a new citizenship agreement. The fee was raised from DKK 3,800. for 4,000 kroner. with the aim of financing expenditure associated with the increased administrations resulting from several elements of the most recent agreement on citizenship. As mentioned, the Conservative People's Party proposes to introduce a fee for reapplication for Danish citizenship. We agree that it should not be possible to have an application for Danish citizenship examined in one place. Having said that, we think it is right for applicants to be able to deal with the first re-application without having to pay again. However, we are not a hundred per cent opposed to the proposal and, as the Minister has also said, we are open to discussing the proposal in the circle of agreements.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162404	Thank you very much. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Morten Dahlin from the Left. Morten Dahlin I think I need to sneeze). Well, then sneeze away. It's not prohibited by the Rules of Procedure. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162430	Thank you, President. Fourth Vice-President, on the other hand, it is forbidden to say you). Thank you for the floor, President. In the Left we support the charging of a fee for re-application for Danish citizenship, and we do so because it is not free to process applications. In fact, more than a third of the people who were refused last year had previously been refused. It is obviously a burden on the system, it is expensive to administer, and it creates very long processing times, which the proposers also describe in the comments to the proposal. That is why we in the Left think it is quite fair that people who re-claim citizenship after having been refused are themselves helping to finance the extra costs. However, it is important for me to note that we in the Left do not believe that an additional fee should lead to additional revenue for the state. That is not how we read the Conservative People's Party proposal. The fee should not exceed the actual costs, but of course reflect the actual cost level. Therefore, it will be necessary to examine exactly what the amount of the fee should be, how it should be composed, so that it reflects the cost of the application. However, we welcome this proposal and we are also pleased that the Minister has taken it down positively. We therefore participate constructively in the discussions that may come and, should the proposal be put to the vote and not end up in a report, we also support the proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162605	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162608	Thank you to the Left both for supporting the proposal and for helping once again to move in the direction that the rapporteur did before, which is that we sit down and look at the small adjustments that we are apparently several parties that seem necessary in relation to the citizenship agreement. So we look forward to that discussion. And I am glad that the Left shares our view.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162630	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162631	You're welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162639	Then we thank the rapporteur of the Left and then we welcome the next rapporteur, Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406162641	Thank you very much, President. When you register for the birth test, you will have to pay a fee for the exam of DKK 825, and you will have to pay DKK 4,000 on top of that. in order to be allowed to apply for the right of entry and different considerations of legality, length of proceedings and retroactive effect can be made. First of all, there is legality: it is possible to regard a fee as unlawful if it is not proportional to the cost of processing the application or the benefit applied for. The Ministry of Justice stated in 2014 that the costs of processing an application for naturalisation amount to approx. 3,900 kr. This means that a fee for reapplication can be considered to be illegally levied tax. Paragraph 43 of the Basic Law provides that no tax may be levied without it being determined by law. As far as the length of proceedings is concerned, it sounds good to think that a fee can reduce the length of proceedings. The agreement on a new circular letter of 2018 also included a new increase in the application fee from DKK 1,200. to DKK 3,800, and again in the last agreement last year, where the fee has been raised from DKK 3,800. for 4,000 kroner. In this connection, have we reduced processing time, and are there several years' work? That's how you can ask. And did the Minister take steps to recruit more staff, or did the Minister employ several annual work in 2018, 2019, 2020 or 2021? These are also questions. I would like further clarification on how the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration can increase the fee for the application for citizenship from DKr 1,200. for DKr 3,800. to now 4,000 kroner. without hiring several years' work. In addition, the justification for the massive increase in fees was allegedly a work on a thorough review of granted citizenship during the period 2014-2018. However, the Ministry has long since completed its review and the fee has not then been reduced, but has been increased, as I said. So it sounds inconvenient to introduce additional fees for re-applications, but the processing time is not reduced for that reason. There's not that automatic, unfortunately. As far as retroactivity is concerned, it has to be stated that, although one knows very well that the conditions are not met, one can obviously still seek. And this is believed to be being exploited to too great an extent. It should also be remembered that conditions have been introduced retroactively, so it is not the case that one necessarily knows when one seeks whether one has been bought or sold, and of that it is the case that one sometimes seeks, even if it turns out that one does not meet the conditions. There are also cases where the application does not meet the requirements simply because the application has been received prematurely. Thus, after a permanent residence permit, you have to take the nationality test and calculate the duration of the proceedings, but can therefore be refused because no two years have passed since the permanent residence permit was obtained. And in such cases, of course, you will seek again. Of course, we should be able to do this again, in other words, without a new fee, because the length of the proceedings must not be the risk for the applicant. Finally, I would like to welcome the SF and say that they do not support the proposal either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163050	Thank you, Mr President. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163053	Thank you to the rapporteur. This resolution is based on some very, very alarming figures, among others. that in the last calendar year, 238 applicants were refused applications for citizenship because they already had judgments on everything else being equal, you can then figure it out if you have a judgment of your own. And others were refused because they had not passed the birth test, and that is also something you know in advance. So there's such a culture of walking, then it goes, and then you search again and again because it's free. If a model were made so that the initial application was a little cheaper, and then second, third and fourth applications had an even lower rate and that the proceeds that went into the state were thus exactly the same, would perhaps the rapporteur's party be able to see itself in such a model?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163145	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163146	Thank you for the question. It can be seen that the Ministry of Justice has stated that the costs amount to approx. 3,900 DKK, and that calculation must then also take into account the assessment that also at the time when the Ministry of Justice calculated it, in 2014, there were re-applications. So I just don't think the equation is consistent. At least that's what I'm gonna say. I simply do not believe that it is within the scope of what is possible. Having said that, we can also consider which situations are being re-examined. There are, for example: it has retroactive effect, as mentioned, and there may also be all sorts of other different reasons. You can also apply for a refusal because you think you have a good reason to get a derogation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163245	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163246	It's just to make it clear here that what we're up to is that when you're looking for the second or third time, you have to pay the full fee. Could the rapporteur then see himself in a model where the first-time fee was lower, but then there was an even lower fee on the second, third, fourth time application, so that we do not have hundreds of criminals or people who have not passed the birth test, who are just looking over and over again because there is no second, third, fourth time fee. Can the rapporteur see himself in a low fee for repeat applications?
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163317	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163319	Unfortunately, there are many reasons why we cannot, and one of the reasons may also be the problem with the duration of the proceedings, that is, there are many parts of the circular which are linked to the fact that the duration of the proceedings ends up being the risk for the applicant. This seems to us to be a huge problem and we would very much like to call for instead of applying for several years' work. It should be possible to resolve the problem in this way instead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163358	Thank you very much to the radical rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Kristian Thulesen Dahl, not from Enhedslisten, but from Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163407	If you are a foreigner and you are in this country and you have reached the situation where you want to apply for Danish citizenship, you have nothing at all against paying a fee for it. Nor is it against paying a relatively large fee. For the gift it would be to get Danish citizenship is so great that you would like to pay a fee for that. And there is then a fee today when you apply there for the first time, and then you get rejected because you do not meet the criteria or for any other reason, and then you may want to apply again after a few years. And those we want to become Danish citizens have no problem paying a fee for the second time; to search again. For it would be so great a gift to get Danish citizenship that those people will be very happy about that. It wouldn't matter if you had to pay a fee for it, so they could easily pay the fee for it. Then there are some in this Chamber who have an incredibly zealous attitude towards these foreigners: they must not at last pay the second or third or fourth time they seek, and they have very, very difficult to see for themselves that they should. And we in the Danish People's Party find this strange, that is to say, that you can have that attitude. Because we think these people think it's perfectly natural that you pay a fee, including the second or third or fourth time you have to apply. Unless, of course, you are among those who are actually just looking for, knowing that they may not actually get citizenship, but who, what the proposers also write somewhere, thinks: If it goes, then it goes. But, frankly, it does not matter if they have the opportunity to think twice, whether they should seek again, or whether they should wait and make a little more effort to meet the requirements and then only seek when they may have a more credible reason to believe that they can acquire citizenship. That is why we think it is quite fine that this is being proposed here; that there are also fees for the second and third and fourth times that are being sought. Then the question is what the fee should be. I understand from the Minister that a debate is already under way here on what the fee should be. And it is fantastic that we here in the Danish Parliament can facilitate the parties' opportunities to go together and then find a runway. It is almost the case that the amounts are in progress. And Mr. Marcus Knuth is already saying that if the first-time fee is a little less, could you get something through the second and third time? It is good that we have used our time constructively in this Chamber. I mean, a fee you must by nature be aligned with what kind of costs you have. For what this is all about with a fee is, in fact, that a foreigner does not, if it is citizenship, pass some costs on to Danish taxpayers, so that even as a foreigner you account for the cost of the public contribution to the application you make. And that is why I think it is rather strange that the Minister is already launching such negotiations here and saying that it is far too high to say that it should be the same fee as at the first time. It has to be less says the minister. Why is that? Is there any evidence that the cost is less, the second time you seek, or the third time you seek? Or could one not imagine that the cost is probably about the same? And, of course, the amount must also be the same. So basically we shall support the proposal that something should be done here, sir. Marcus Knuth. We will support that from the Danish People's Party, and we think it's good to facilitate this discussion between parties about what it's going to land on. We hope that it will come down to paying the costs, as a minimum, of course, so as not to impose costs on taxpayers. That is what is crucial here. You can discuss what the cost is. Is it alone some employees over in a ministry, or is it really also the costs that Danish society incurs? But we can then have a discussion on that so that it can be confirmed. We support the proposal that we should of course pay the costs not only for the first time, but also for the second, third and fourth time, so that we do not impose costs on taxpayers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163758	Thank you. Mr President, there is one brief comment. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163801	I would just like to make a brief comment to Mr. Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech. Now I have been working on the area of citizenship for two years, and I keep finding gaps and imbalances. This is unbelievable. When we closed that deal a year ago, I had some sort of naive idea that you pay a full fee every time. I thought so, but it's not like that. The second, third and fourth times you pay no fee. The reason I found out was a question from the Danish People's Party, namely from Mr. Peter Skaarup, who just asked the Minister how many people are actually refused and why. After all, it is every year hundreds of criminals who seek, and hundreds of people who have not passed the test of birth, who know clearly that they are not living up to it. So I really just want to say thank you to the Danish People's Party, for this whole debate and this whole proposal comes from a question from the Danish People's Party. So thank you for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163848	Thank you very much, and in this way we can help to solve some of the challenges we face, we are very happy to do so, even if, as last year, we do not end up in the overall agreement. But we can try to influence things in other ways. Thank you, sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163904	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. Now it's Mrs. Mette Thiesen from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163911	A great deal has been said from this platform, and I shall say little more than that this is quite common sense. When you apply for Danish citizenship, it must of course cost both the first time, the second time, the third time and so on. So that is quite common sense, and that is why we naturally support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163937	Thank you to Mrs Mette Thiesen. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406163948	Thank you, sir. President. When I come after Mrs Mette Thiesen, I always have to adjust the height of the platform, and then I will tell Mrs Mette Thiesen that I think it was Churchill who said that a good speech is a short speech. So that was a good speech made by the rapporteur. I will make my speech a little longer, not least because I am the proposer of the proposal here, and thank you for a good debate. As I said, it is a debate that arises from an answer to a question from the Danish People's Party, and I was really about to fall out of the chair when I heard that every year hundreds of applicants apply again and again, even though they have extensive convictions for crime, and there are hundreds of people who have not passed the test of citizenship, knowing that they do not meet the criteria that are constantly seeking. It is a form of abuse because it is just free, because if it goes, it goes, and it may be that you get through the system and get Danish citizenship, even if you have committed crime, and even if you do not live up to the rules. Of course, when you make a resolution, you always hope that it will be adopted one by one. The reality is that this is rarely the case. However, I would like to thank the Danish People's Party in particular and the New Citizens' Party and the Left for supporting the proposal if it comes to the vote. But politics is the art of compromise, so I am glad that the Minister is accommodating and says that we can have a talk about it and see if we can find each other and understand that there is no fee for re-applications. As a result, hundreds of people abuse it by seeking it over and over again and who, in addition to those who may, by mistake, get a Danish citizenship, are also a burden on our official work. So thank you for that acknowledgement to the Minister. We are very pleased that the Minister will have a talk about this and will try to find a new model, which may not be exactly the model we are proposing here, but at least is a model that is better than the one we have today. So thank you to the Minister and thank you to everyone for a good debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406164140	Thank you very much to the rapporteur for the authors. No one else has asked for the floor. The debate is closed. I propose that the motion for a resolution be referred to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and, if no one objects, I consider this to be adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220406164153	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Thursday, 7 April, at 9 a.m. 10:00. I refer to the agenda that will appear on the Danish Parliament's website.
