ParlaMint-DK_20220302130007	The meeting is open. I have to inform you that Questions 1 and 2 are on the agenda (pm. No. S 532 and S 533) to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by Søren Søndergaard (EL) are deleted. At the same time, I must inform you that Question 4 is on the agenda (pm. No. S 536) to the Minister for Justice, by Alex Vanopslagh (LA), is deleted at the request of the author. I should also like to inform you that Question 12 is on the agenda (pm. No. S 534) to the Minister for Equal Opportunities for Birgitte Bergman (KF) is deleted at the request of the author.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130033	We are going to address questions to the ministers. And first of all, it is to the Minister of Justice of Mrs Britt Bager, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130039	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130041	Thank you. Is the Minister prepared to take the initiative to amend the rules on detention so that a person charged with several circumstances which are capable of causing danger to others may be in custody even if the offences are likely to result in penalties for fines or imprisonment for a maximum period of 30 days?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130104	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130106	Thank you for the floor, and thank you to the author for asking the question. Perhaps you could say one more time. This time it was for an oral answer. And I should like to begin by stating that I share the honourable Member's contempt for the reprehensible behaviour of the specific case. It is totally unacceptable that insanity drivers make roads unsafe and endanger the lives of others. We shouldn't put up with that. That is why I am also pleased that last year we, together with the author's party, took a number of significant steps towards driving madness. We have among other things. made it possible to confiscate cars, although it is not the owner himself who has been driving madness. I think that is a fairly potent tool, and actually quite a lot of cars have been confiscated. We have tightened the penalty significantly for the violations of the Road Traffic Code, which fall within the category of madness driving. This means that the level of punishment has gone from fine to a point of departure for unconditional imprisonment in first cases. The latter means, therefore, that it will be possible, to a greater extent, to be held in custody in such cases. So on the question of whether or not I'm going to change the rules of custody. The Code of Procedure provides that detention may not apply where the offence alone is likely to result in a fine or imprisonment for a maximum of 30 days. This provision reflects the general principle of proportionality which applies to all coercive measures imposed by criminal proceedings and, inter alia, it must: ensure that the final judgment of the person concerned is in line with the length of detention. If you want to allow for detention in cases which are likely to result in imprisonment for less than 30 days, then you have to bear in mind that the basic law here sets limits. As I have also said in my reply of 21 February, it follows from Article 71 (1) of the Constitution. 5. that no one may be placed in custody for an offence which may result only in a penalty in the form of a fine or a penalty. On this point, the Constitution aims to ensure that there can be no detention for what may be called less serious or minor offences. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130315	Here you go. Mrs. Britt Bager.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130316	Thank you, Minister. It was precisely because the question I asked was answered with a review of section 762 of the Code of Procedure that we now take it again orally. Because, of course, I have read section 762 of the Code of Procedure before I put this question in writing. Now we got a review again. What I would actually like to hear from the Minister is whether the Minister is willing to make a change, which means that in repeated cases, repeatedly, gross driving, you can incarcerate a perpetrator Now the Minister himself says something about this particular case. I'm not talking about a specific case. I'm talking about a lot of cases. I am not going to mention the cases, but I would just like to say to the Minister that there are a number of cases in which a driver has been charged 8, 10, 12 up to 26 times for driving without a driving licence, with alcohol in the blood, with drugs in the blood, against red, driving insanely fast without driving 100%. Too strong, because then it can be considered mad driving. But what if you have repeatedly done it and, overall, we can see that there is a pattern here, here is a driver of madness, without being charged with insanity, one where you are likely to see this happening again at the risk of others' lives? We've seen that, sir. Minister. Shouldn't we try to sit down and see what we can do to prevent it from happening again? Is the Minister willing to do that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130500	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130500-2	What I said on the oral question was not to say that it was a waste of any time, on the contrary. This is an important, important issue. What I'm just trying to draw attention to is that according to Paragraph 71 (1) of the Constitution. 5, we cannot incarcerate if what is envisaged is a fine or a penalty of less than 30 days in jail. At that time it was called booklet. However, when one departed from the booklet and instead made it into prison, he translated the booklet into 30 days in prison because it was then the limit for booklets. So there's a constitutional problem that's involved in this case. And I know that we share the view that the Constitution must be respected.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130538	Britt Bager, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130539	Well, I get that, sir. Minister. I fully understand that this is how the legal basis is today. I am looking for an answer to what we are doing to change this situation, to counter the fact that you repeatedly get behind the wheel, drive completely crazy against red with alcohol in your blood, repeatedly. You get your driver's license withdrawn immediately, but you do it again. And the minister sits with the constitution in his hand and says that these are the rules. Is the Minister willing to help change those rules?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130616	Then it's the minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130617	Yes, because if you want to, you have to go that way and say: there is something that we think is so reprehensible that we want to increase the penalty. And that is what we did with the rules on driving madness that have worked since 1 April, as far as I remember, or just about where they came, and I think there is reason to look at how they work. I fully understand the point, and I will certainly not deny that there is a need to do further. Compared to the potent tools of confiscating cars etc. I just think: let's see what the effect of them is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130649	Last question. Here you go, Britt Bager.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130650	Now we're moving a little bit. And I just think that there are a lot of things we can actually do here by looking at the overall driving process. One could also go in to look at the overall driving process and then say that x number of charges or x number of violations of the traffic code is to equate with madness carism. So in addition to the fact that we have a challenge with drivers just going on, we also have a challenge with these cases piling up in the judicial system over several years, because there is waiting time for that discussion to take place at another time. But I hope I hear the Minister say that we are discussing this. Because it's crazy that this is going on out there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130730	Now we hear what the minister says. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130731	In fact, I think there is a little point in what the questioner says, namely this: could there not be any reason to look at the overall process and the number of cases? It's not like we usually accumulate punishment. But one might say that if it is so systematic over a long period of time, then it should somehow qualify for, for example. to be crazy driving or something. So I will certainly not reject that, but I just think that we should get the first experience of things about driving madness in and then get it done.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130805	It is good that you pay attention when the President of Parliament stands up and thank you for that. The question is closed. Thank you to the Minister for Justice and thank you to Mrs Britt Bager, the Conservative People's Party. The next question is to the Minister for Social Affairs and the Elderly by Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130839	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130841	Thank you, Mr President. How does the Minister feel about what the TV 2 documentary has been able to show over recent weeks about the working environment in social psychiatry, where since 2012 six employees have lost their lives while caring for their work and where the documentary generally describes a completely unacceptable working environment?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130902	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302130904	Thank you for the question. It is, of course, tough and difficult working conditions that were shown in the television documentary mentioned. I have a very, very great respect for the huge effort made by the staff on the accommodation offers every day for the most vulnerable people in our society. I believe we have a duty to ensure good and secure working conditions for those who care for the most vulnerable in society. No one should feel insecure about going to work or fearing for his own or his family's safety. We also have a duty to ensure that the individual can feel safe where he lives. We are talking about people's homes, while at the same time it is the workplace of the employees. Over the years, changing governments, and indeed quite often together with the author's party, have taken action to prevent acts of violence on housing offers and to ensure the working environment, but I also think we must be honest and say that what we have together put into the sea has not been enough. This is clear from the unfortunate killings of the last few years and the television documentary. The government has initiated the preparation of a 10-year plan for psychiatry, and the technical presentation which has been followed up points to a number of challenges, among others. the cooperation and coordination between social psychiatry, which we are talking about here, and treatment psychiatry. You can also see very clearly in the documentary that there are some problems there, both in the transition and in coordination. With the academic presentation, which has come from the Danish Health and Social Security Authority to the 10-year plan for psychiatry, we have a solid presentation to stand on. We on the part of the government are looking at the concrete recommendations before there is any discussion with the parties of the Folketing. However, we have not been sitting on our hands in the preparation of the technical proposal. Together with the parties behind the reserve agreement on inter alia: with the latest agreement, we have intensified and targeted the violence prevention efforts against the housing offers that have particular challenges. This means that the housing offers which have been ordered by the Danish Labour Inspectorate or the Social Inspectorate will have the help of the Danish Social Protection Agency's team to rectify and ensure a more secure environment for both residents and employees, and I can elaborate a little more on this when I get the floor again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131113	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131114	Well, I'll look forward to that, and I think there's a lot of people out there looking forward to it. The Minister is right, of course, that we are both talking about people who are in treatment, but what the TV 2 documentary, in particular, has focused on are the people who are employed in psychiatry and who, in any case, according to what we can see on TV 2, are being offered totally unacceptable conditions. We are therefore talking about a very, very comprehensive material with 476 reports, which examines the conditions that we are offering to employees at the moment, and it appears that the Labour Inspectorate has made immediate demands on several occasions, among others. to Ørbækskilde, and that there are simply people who lose their lives at work. It is also about a deeply tragic case involving the 29-year-old Yamma Ahamadzai, who is being murdered at work, and I would have expected that the government of its own motion had taken these things up sooner. Now we are in the Chamber and I have asked for the specific position of the government or the minister here. Apart from a general condemnation, can we not become a little more concrete? What's gone wrong? Why are there no guidelines to ensure that, for example, there are: sharp knives used in the kitchen region, or other things that can be used as an attack weapon, and that is from ashtrays to chairs, and what do I know is somehow being locked down, or at least so that the people who are employed do not have to go to work in fear every day. Could we not just become a little more concrete, Minister, on some of what all Danes, I think, have been sitting with paralysis and seen on the TV screen is the reality for real, very many employees.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131306	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131307	Thank you. Firstly, on top of the murder referred to by the honourable Member, which tragically took place between Christmas and New Year last year, I had the support of the parties to target the teams of efforts that are taking out and helping the concrete offer, in terms of what kind of citizenship we have, what kind of groups they are and what sort of risks there are. So far, the offers themselves had to reach out and say that they need help. Now we agreed to target it, and since then we have been here, I didn't quite get in line with the response, so we get closer to those offers and have the opportunity to get closer to those offers where there are dangerous.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131351	Thank you. Sir. Morten Messerschmidt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131352	Thank you, President. But that doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of those who are still employed here who feel scared. For example: There is a night shift at the institution, where of course there are more mentally ill people, and you sit there alone, and you cannot get a call alarm, you cannot make sure that knives, for example. is locked in a kitchen drawer so that you could get the knives where you need them, namely by preparing food. Does the Minister not have a position on this and can give a hand to those people who are afraid when they go to work and can say that you don't have to be, because now we do this and that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131431	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131432	I think it is important to say that there are rules in this area and that management has a specific responsibility in relation, for example, to the environment. such a thing as the author refers to, by attaching knives and similar ones. In the specific killing that we are circling here, it was the resident's own knife that was at stake, but basically there is an obligation for the management, in relation to the fact that if the risk of violence cannot be adequately addressed, the employees must, for example: not work alone. So in this way there is a set of rules, and there is also a set of rules that are enforced when the Factory Inspectorate is out. However, in the context of the greater discussion of what we are doing for the target group, which is particularly difficult here, and which contains both severe mentally ill and also drug addicts, and thus can react in dangerous ways, I think we need an offer that does not exist today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131517	Sir. Morten Messerschmide for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131519	Thank you, President. Now I'm just quoting from one of the articles TV 2 has published about this, and I quote with the President's permission: "The teams on several of the settlements are so critical that the employees can report everything from stabbing to death threats and threats of rape or persecution. 20 of the 474 cases that TV 2 has seen involve knife-snife-snife-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-snake-s. Is that acceptable, Minister?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131554	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131555	It is, of course, absolutely crucial that local management should address the question: do we have the right framework for the citizens we have on our accommodation offer? That is to say, do you have a man who makes it indefensible to have citizens who are seriously mentally ill and drug addicts at the same time, because you cannot work alone if there is a risk of violent and violent incidents, but then you should not accept the citizens of that target group? That is why this is also linked to the greater work that we are undertaking in the field of specialized social planning, so that we ensure that there are the right offers for the citizens who are very complex, and these are the citizens here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131631	The question is over. We will continue with questions to the Minister for Social Affairs and the elderly and with Mr. Morten Messerschmidt asking.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131636	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131638	Thank you, President. What concrete initiatives does the Minister plan to initiate as a follow-up to the TV2 documentary?Insanely dangerous work? For example, locking dangerous tools, attack alarms, better staffing and later integration into society of mentally ill people, and more listening to employees' wishes, etc.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131657	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131658	After all, we are continuing a little where we left off, which is why it is also very, very important for me to say that it is one of the most fundamental tasks and one of the most fundamental responsibilities of local management to ensure that employees can go to work safely. It is up to management to assess on an ongoing basis what is needed to take advantage of the grip that is available for use, in relation to the attack alarm, in relation to the prohibition of work alone and in relation to e.g. to lock dangerous tools, knives and other things inside. It is the responsibility of the management to ensure that there is the right staffing, in relation to what some citizens and residents have on the offer, and it is the clear responsibility of the management also to listen to the employees when reporting on the working environment and to provide assessments that there is a basis and need for additional effort. It can, for example. be the Social Protection Agency's action teams, which may have a process in relation to preventing dangerous working conditions. But we also need to do something more fundamental and, as we were also around in the question and answer before, we have a very important task in ensuring that you have the right offers for the right residents, that is. residents who are severely mentally ill and drug addicts. There we need a better offer than what we have today, and the government has agreed with municipalities and regions in the economic agreements that this offer should be made. We work hard at life to draw the right lines so that we can get this offer, because it is clear that it is a target group that is both extremely vulnerable, but can also be particularly risky in relation to the employees, because you can be in one way in your mental illness and well-treated in it, but if you add so narcotics, there may suddenly be an unpredictability, a violence and a danger that you have not planned with, and therefore it requires that there are some special frames here. Therefore, this is related to the work to ensure that there is the right offer and the right framework in relation to the people for whom it is said that they are double-loaded or double-diagnosed. And that is also the target group that the questioner is asking about in relation to the specific television broadcast. We don't need any more small pools. We need to take the structural approach and ensure that there are the right offers for the right target groups here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131904	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302131906	We need to get the right structural grip, that is to say, it sounds like I'm talking to the Minister for Transport here. It's not. That is the Minister for Social Affairs, I expect, and that is why I expect it to be about people: on the one hand, those who are hospitalised and live in these institutions and, on the other hand, those who are employed. And I just have to say that I think it sounds like a major shift of responsibility when the Minister just says it is the responsibility of the management. So, the point is that in the specific episode described in the TV 2 documentary, with Yamma Ahamadzai, who is killed at work, the closest colleague is 2.5 km away. Then it is true, as the Minister says, that some immediate orders have been made to the institution Ørbækskilde, but this has not changed the fact that in the cases in which TV 2 has dug down, 79 are alone and work alone, i.e. people who feel abandoned and insecure when they go to work. What I am asking in this question, because there is, after all, some thought behind the way I have divided it up here, is: what concrete steps will the Minister take to ensure that the many people who are afraid when they go to work do not have to be afraid? Because it obviously doesn't work to go to management. Well, Yamma had also gone to his leadership. Unfortunately, that did not prevent him from being killed at work anyway. Then no clearer guidelines could be drawn up on which these employees could rely, for example. That if there is a danger of going to work, one should not be there alone. It does not need to be a management decision locally; it might well be something the minister provided for • or that one could at least get an attack alarm, or that one could have a door that could at least not be broken in, perhaps with a double lock or something, i.e. something that could be a handshake to these people, Minister?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132053	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132055	Thank you. When I talk about the structural grip, it's not that I don't know this is about people. Then it is in recognition that the efforts we have made together in the Folketing over the last 10 years, which have been projects, have been pools and have been small efforts, have not done so. We need a different map, so to speak, so that we can be sure that we have the right offers for those people who are most complex and who can be most dangerous to work with and where it can be hardest to predict with their social skills how they react because drugs are involved. That's what I mean when I'm talking about, we have to solve this structuralally this time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132133	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132134	But there is nothing concrete here. I am even, I think, kind enough to mention some very specific things that the Minister could have just said. Can we count on more assault alarms? Can we expect you not to be alone in these institutions if there is a legitimate danger to your life and health? Can we just have something concrete instead of talking about some structural conditions? I honestly don't think that makes people feel safer at night.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132203	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132205	After all, the structural aspect is to ensure that there is the right framework for the right citizens, and today there is the possibility of attack alarms. There is a possibility of locking knives. There is a possibility that you may not work alone if you cannot counter the violence. Morten Messerschmidt is requesting. Alongside this, we have a whistleblower scheme that employees can turn to if they find that their management does not listen to them. And we have on top of the last case on my initiative, but fortunately with broad support, ensured that the team of action that exists in this area can go to the places where it burns, even if the management has not thought it necessary to reach out for help, but that they actually come by and make sure that we can pick up the places where the working environment is too dangerous.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132242	Sir. Morten Messerschmide for the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132243	How about we just make it a right? So, what if we said that if you are employed and have night work at these institutions, you have the right to have knives locked in; then you have the right to an assault alarm; then you have the right to a colleague who can be there within perhaps five minutes; then you have the right to a door that cannot be kicked into the office? How about giving these employees some rights instead of standing around talking about structures of which no one understands the specific content?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132311	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132312	But it is the case today that after the Factory Inspectorate comes out and finds that there should be no single work here; here you should lock up the knives, then they can give orders, and then you have to live up to it. The questioner will also know this because it also took place on the specific offer, which was instructed to lock kitchen utensils as far as I remember. So what the questioner is calling for already exists today. I think we have to stop acting like there's a one-stop shop here. We have jointly tried addressing this without going basic enough to work for more than 10 years. Now we are actually working to make the basic solution that I have called the structural solution, and I hope that the Danish People's Party will support that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132348	The question is over. Thank you to the Minister for Social Affairs and the elderly. Thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmide. We move on to the Minister for Children and Education with a question by Mr. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132401	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132402	Thank you. Why does the Minister think that in future high school students should be deprived of the opportunity to choose their own high school and that their place of education should instead be dictated by the income of their parents?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132418	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132419	Neither do I.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132426	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132427	Thank you for that very brief answer. If the Minister is so clear about the fact that it is not the income of pupils' parents who decide where to go in high school, why has the government, by a majority in the Folketing, reached a political agreement in which pupils may be forced to be forced to rely on what their parents earn? Why has such an agreement been made? When you stand in this Chamber and claim that it is not the parents' purse that must be decisive, why has an agreement been made where the parameter from which people are forced is what their parents earn?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132505	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132506	Well, there are incredibly many premises in this that are completely on the moon, to put it bluntly. First of all, it is a mishmask, in relation to what is free choice and what is free absorption. Today there is free choice, but there is no free admission. In the future model there is also free choice, but there is no free entry in the future model. It's just a few different parameters that determine it. And that means that the whole premise about why the Minister believes that high school students should in future be deprived of the opportunity to choose their high school is simply nonsense. I have seen the rapporteur of the Left touring the social media with it, but that is simply not true. And it is also reflected in the fact that the Left was a party that I negotiated with in something similar to a year and a half, and only in the end did the Left choose not to go with ■ well, mainly because the Conservatives did not go with it. So it's just to say that the Left was part of this solution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132556	Thank you. Sir. Morten Dahlin, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132557	I'm sorry, but this discussion here is gonna be absurd. We have the current Minister of Education, who is simply claiming that she has not made an agreement in which the income of parents will determine where pupils are allowed to go to high school. I mean, you've made a model that divides students into three categories: low, middle and high income, that is, based on what their parents earn. And depending on the category they're in, they have to go to a certain high school. What is it like not to be based on parents'income?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132628	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132629	Well, I don't know if sir. Morten Dahlin is aware of this, but that part of the agreement, the Left, was in the contract room. So I am not quite sure what has changed since we sat at the negotiating table. And in this regard, I would say that the reason why the Left joined is that you have not made a single offer for a different solution and not one bid. And now it's shaking my head, so I'm incredibly excited to hear what it is, sir. Morten Dahlin can say that is different from what was said in the negotiating room, namely that the Left endorsed this part of the agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132656	Sir. Morten Dahlin for the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132658	The left is not part of this agreement, because we believe that it is up to the pupils themselves to choose where they go to high school, not the Minister of Education, not the Prime Minister, and that should not be the parents' income at all. And I note that the Minister does not even dare defend his policy here today. The minister makes it sound as if high school students are not dependent on what their parents earn. Would the Minister just confirm for the sake of clarity that for the future there will be zones in Denmark where pupils are divided into categories, depending on what their parents earn, and then one must be placed at a high school on the basis of parental pay?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132731	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132732	Yes, it is in the agreement, and it was actually part of the agreement that the Left endorsed at the negotiating table. It's just the way it was. Sir. Morten Dahlin was not himself involved in the negotiations, but it may be that Mr. Morten Dahlin will speak to her rapporteur, Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby, who sat at the negotiating table. And I just wanted to say that the Left endorsed this part of the deal. And we from the Social Democrats are opposed to high schools being divided into rich and poor; we are against high schools being divided between the brown colleges and the white colleges, that is, we have parallel social conditions in part of our high schools. So we have had an agreement with the Left on this, I can hear that Mr. Morten Dahlin is somewhere else than the Left did in the negotiating room. That's interesting.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132810	The question is over. Thank you, sir. Morten Dahlin. We will continue with a question to the Minister for Children and Education, but now the questioner is Mrs Mai Mercado, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132820	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132821	Is it good governance, in the Minister's view, that members of the Folketing cannot obtain impact assessments of the forced distribution of high school pupils, even though the Minister used them in negotiations on pupil distribution?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132835	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302132836	These are incredibly short answers to the question simply: Yes. And if that were not the case, I would have given the figures. And I would like to elaborate on that, because I think that I have thought about it very carefully. These are, of course, figures that I have given both to the Conservatives and to the Left in the course of the negotiations, which means that those who have been sitting and taking the decisions have, of course, been aware of the figures. That is why there has actually been quite a lot of thought behind the fact that I have chosen not to present them. The reason for this is that these figures can be used at an aggregated level with all sorts of uncertainties in the stomach, but on the individual institutions it can have quite major consequences whether the capacity setting will be one or the other. And since we do not yet know what capacity setting will be, those figures will reflect something that will not become reality or become reality in a different way. In other words, we run the risk that a lot of institutions will experience a very, very great uncertainty that will never come true, while others think that everything is good and that they will continue as usual, after which there will be a capacity-setting that shows something quite different. So, when I think that this is good governance, it is actually after careful, careful consideration when it comes to saying: what is the knowledge needed to make political decisions, and has that knowledge been available to those who have helped to make those decisions, and what is that knowledge that should be available to the institutions? And there is the fact that this summer there will be new figures, which will still be subject to great uncertainty, but which will come closer. So it is simply a desire not to create a lot of insecurity on the institutions and in the local community, if it is not the case that those figures ever come true. And there's just not been a capacity setting yet.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133013	Mai Mercado, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133014	So the minister turns the entire student distribution upside down and changes the distribution so that it becomes the parents' income that determines which high school students can choose, but without the figures actually being secure. It's a very big gamble with students' future choice of high schools. And I think the Minister knows that too, and I think the Minister is afraid of what will happen if those figures come out. Because if those numbers come from, everyone will see legend; then you will see exactly where it is that you will not be able to enter a high school yourself, and where it is that you will be pushed. And then you will discover what kind of manoeuvre the Minister is undertaking, and that is why I would just like to appeal openly here in my question whether the Minister will not decide and actually present those figures.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133103	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133104	I would actually say that I do not think it has been an easy decision whether or not these figures should be presented. I do not think that any new arguments have been put forward here, I would like to say, but I was actually open to the fact that there could be arguments that attributed it. In fact, it is quite the opposite, because what Mrs Mai Mercado says is that then you would have a vision of legend; then you would know what you had to relate to. That is precisely why I am not going to present them, because that is not the figure. And to make it quite concrete: what lies in the figures that have not been presented is some estimates of how the classes will distribute. And for a specific school, it makes a pretty big difference whether it's 10 classes or 12 classes you get. But these figures only say that in the form of estimates and not in concrete form, but that is how you want to react.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133143	Mrs. Mai Mercado, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133144	I think it is beneath all criticism that the Minister will not present the basis for the decision so that in the individual municipalities you can see how serious it is actually going to be for the individual family, for the individual young people who want to go to high school. At the same time, it will also be important for the government to show its secrecy, that is to say that one is not democratically minded, that one does not want openness when it comes to choosing to keep the basis of figures hidden. So just as a desire to ensure transparency, I would like to make a third call for those figures to be presented.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133220	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133221	If it were the case that you could actually see how serious it was, that is to say, in the sense that if the figures were accurate, I would have presented them. In fact, the challenges here are that you cannot, and that means that it is both in one direction and in the other. There are some schools which, with these figures, would think that this is where the future lies for us and that a few classes would be shaved from, while for other schools it would be the other way around, that is that it may appear when the actual capacity setting is there that it is the other way around. So it is just to say that the discussion would simply be based on a basis based on the individual institutions that do not fit. What we have then presented is the aggregated figure where you can see what the consequence is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133257	Then it is Mrs Mai Mercado for her last question in this round.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133259	So the fact that the figures are so uncertain that you really don't know what kind of exercise you have started and that you can only say something at aggregated level is a huge problem. So either you choose to turn it all around and yet you can't use those numbers for much, or you choose to hide the numbers because you don't want to show the students what they're actually gonna lose out of freedom of choice. That's a problem, isn't it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133325	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133326	[Sound emission]... the answer is that it is the first, because we do not have their search patterns; that is the reason for the uncertainty, that is to say, in the sense that it is simply about that these are the numbers on which we base the calculations. One cannot really do anything else, because they are not looking until they seek, and that means that students who have to apply to high school, including among other things. My own son, who is to apply for a youth education programme in 2023, has not yet applied. And that means that the numbers and calculations we make are based on old search patterns. We cannot change the fact that all we have are old search patterns, since the new search patterns only come when people have actually sought. That is the reason for the uncertainty and therefore the answer is in the first category of response options.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133404	Thank you. The question is over. But we shall continue to the next question with both the Minister for Children and Education and Mrs Mai Mercado.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133411	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133412	Will the Minister introduce a model for the distribution of pupils, which also includes free and private schools, and will it then base itself on an algorithm based on parental income, as proposed by the Minister's party colleague Jens Joel in Weekendavisen, or can the Minister guarantee that there will be no student distribution model involving free and private schools?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133431	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133433	Let me be as clear as I really can. After all, we have not yet presented a model on the part of the government, but we have an understanding paper, and the foundation for the government and for the agreement with the support parties is that free and private schools should take greater social responsibility. One of the ways to do that is to get a larger share of those students who have social challenges. That is why it is obvious, when planning the distribution of pupils in the primary school sector, to live up to that understanding paper. After all, we have reached an agreement with the support parties on this. So, of course, we'll look at free and private schools. The part that I cannot say clearly about yet because then we would have presented the model is what kind of model we are working on, but I would say: I am very pleased with Mr. Jens Joel's book, and I've read it very carefully. We are not ready to put forward a proposal yet, but the idea that one should of course go to school with one another cross-country rather than having parallel societies in Denmark, I am entirely behind it. So I hope the Conservatives do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133535	Mrs. Mai Mercado.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133537	So first you want to destroy it in relation to the youth's high school elections, and now you want to send all school students out on long bus trips in the municipality because you in the Social Democracy know best. May I just remind you that every year the municipalities change the school districts. And they change school districts to get a more mixed distribution. School districts are, after all, the students' immediate area; this is their local area. So why do we suddenly have to have students being busted around across the municipalities?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133613	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133615	I have not heard any proposals on this either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133619	Mrs. Mai Mercado.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133621	When I read Mr. Jens Joel's book, at least I get the clear impression that you want to break up with the ordinary district school and that you want to take a very hard hold on the free schools by among other things. to change the coupling percentage. I just want to ask you if not sir. Jens Joel and the Minister for Children and Education, who come from the same party, have the same political visions for primary school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133648	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133649	Yes, we certainly do. After all, it is Mrs Mai Mercado who stands and interprets something completely away from the window, to put it bluntly. In other words, one of the places where you have had a desire to drive with one large school district is the Gentofte municipality, where Mrs Mai Mercado's party colleague sits as mayor. And one of the reasons why you wanted to do so is that it gave more flexibility in relation to the distribution of pupils in schools. I personally thought that was an enormously sensible move. I also know that Glostrup Municipality, in their school district form, runs with schools that are arranged in a different way. The City of Odense has wanted to be allowed to organize their school districts in other ways. I think we should be open to that. It has nothing to do with what Mrs Mai Mercado says, and it has nothing to do with what Mr Mai Mercado says. Jens Joel's book.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133728	Mrs Mai Mercado for her last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133729	Time and again, together with the Enhedslisten and the Radical Left, we have fought against reducing the coupling rate, and that, as Mr. Jens Joel has been out to say that you want to change the connection rate for the free schools, so that a free school like Billum Friskole at Varde, which arose because the local school closed, must therefore expect a change in their switching rate. Is that how you have to understand the policy of social democracy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133757	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133758	Well, it fell with a bang. It's just to say that we didn't have any support for it. But it cannot possibly be new to the Conservative rapporteur that the Social Democratic Party had that proposal. We were the only party in the Folketing who wanted it and, as you know, we need a majority in order to achieve it. But that can't possibly be news. What we have then agreed with the support parties is that you have to take greater social responsibility, and if you do not, it must have a consequence for the coupling rate. It was as far as the Social Democrats could drive it in those negotiations, and I am, of course, pleased that the support parties want it, because it is better than nothing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133831	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the Minister and thank you to Mrs Mai Mercado. We proceed with a question to the Minister of Transport, and it is by Hans Andersen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133839	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133841	Thank you. What initiatives will the Minister take to respond to the rising noise nuisances at Crown Princess Marys's Bro?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133852	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302133854	Thank you for the question. There is no doubt that Crown Princess Marys's Bro is an important hub for a great many citizens. We in the government are very aware of the challenges of traffic noise, and it is a major social problem that we see a high level of noise from traffic around Denmark. As regards the Fjord connection to Frederikssund, I can inform you that a great deal has already been done in the construction phase to reduce noise nuisances for the people living near the bridge and thus the connection was equipped with noise shielding in accordance with the construction law of the project. The Fjord link then opened for traffic in 2019 subject to user charges, and from the turn of 2021-2022 the user fee has now been abolished as a result of the agreement on the Infrastructure Plan 2035 concluded by the government last summer with a broad majority of parties, and thanks for that. I have been informed that the scope of noise protection in the Construction Act was the so-called main proposals of the Road Directorate in the environmental impact assessment of the project carried out by the Directorate in 2010. The main proposal did not provide for user charges on the plant and therefore the current abolition of user charges did not alter the conditions for assessing noise protection at the time. Moreover, the current traffic figures do not exceed the expected traffic volume taken into account in the environmental impact assessment. Having said that, there is, of course, no doubt that the citizens near the fjord link are experiencing an increased traffic image and thus an increased noise level after the end of user charges. And that is something which, of course, must be included in the discussions that are in the conciliation circle behind the Infrastructure Plan 2035, where the party of the questioner also participates. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134053	Sir. Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134054	Thank you, and first congratulations to the Minister with the ministerial post and appointment. And that is quite right: noise affects a lot of people. And we are all delighted in Frederikssund that there is no longer any user charge on Crown Princess Marys's Bro. And then it is true that traffic has actually doubled in number after the user payment has been removed. And then I would like to ask the Minister what the Minister thinks about having new noise measurements made on the basis of the new current figures. And I'd recommend that you do that. Noise measurements were last made back in 2020, i.e. when we had user charges. Now there is no longer any user charge, and then I think I would recommend that we make noise measurements so that we can have the best basis for the forthcoming discussions on how to allocate the funds we have allocated for noise protection. I think that would be a good step to take, and I want to hear what the Minister thinks about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134206	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134207	Well, a new national noise mapping has already been planned in 2022, which will form the basis for the important work of the coming years in the field of noise. And in that noise mapping traffic on the fjord connection will also be included.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134223	Sir. Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134224	We need the Minister to tell us that concrete noise measurements must be made on Crown Princess Marys's Bro. I need the Minister to go into that. And then it is all about the fact that, unfortunately, that stretch is also being used for driving crazy and what the Minister will do to ensure that we do not get crazy rides when we go into the summer and young people on motorcycles sort of drive back and forth. One solution could be that we had speed gauges set up over a distance on the respective Crown Princess Marys's Bro.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134257	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134258	It is two slightly different things, and then they are still gone two sides of the same case. One is our very strong effort towards driving madness, and I will always pay close attention to this, and I also have a desire to participate in it if there is anything we can improve in terms of driving madness. However, a number of significantly aggravating conditions have been put in place regarding precisely the driving of madness. The second is about the noise measurements planned in 2022, in which the fjord connection is included.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134333	The last question to Mr. Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134334	But driving madness was the best expression I had for young people on a motorcycle one summer evening running back and forth, and it doesn't get any less after it's gone free, and I think we should do something about that together. We have two things that are noise, and there is madness driving, and on that basis I would like to invite the Minister up so that we can visit the area, both in relation to talking to the citizens who are exposed to noise, but also so that the Minister can see for himself that there is a crazy run on that bridge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134412	Thank you. Then it's the minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134413	Well I always come to visit, I do all over the country, and even though I have run over Crown Princess Marys's Bro several times, I am happy to do it again, and also gladly with the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134427	Thank you. That concludes the question. Thank you to the Minister for Transport, and thank you to Mr. Hans Andersen. We continue, but now it is with the Minister for Gender Equality, and the questioner is Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134437	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134439	Thank you. The government and the Ministry of Justice have announced a gang package this spring on top of a series of shootings and killings, so will the government, as part of and in continuation of the support for the resolution on an action plan against feminicide, call for negotiations on a partner violence package, strengthening legal certainty, increasing social efforts and improving housing provision and assistance for victims of partner violence?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134510	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134511	Thank you very much for the question. Women are much more exposed to women than men, among other things. partner violence and killing. Nearly 40,000 women are subjected each year to physical violence by their partner. 2,000 women apply to shelters every year because of violence, and almost as many children accompany their mother to women's shelters. On average, 1 woman is killed every month in Denmark by her partner or ex-partner. It's alone because she's a woman. This is totally unacceptable and reflects a serious problem of equality. Action against partner violence and partner killings is very high on the government's agenda. We want to prevent violence so that it does not escalate and, in the extreme, ends in killing. We can see, by partner killing, but also killing from an unknown, often is the culmination of a longer process in which the perpetrator is previously known for assault. Therefore, we must intervene earlier and be better at stopping violence as soon as it occurs. That is why the government wants to work on a new action plan to strengthen the fight against partner violence and killings, and that is why we have launched an inter-ministerial working group on violence against women and violence in close relations. We need to take action against the perpetrators early and to work to break the cycle of violence, not least so that children do not grow up in families where father acts violence against mother. Much more preventive action is needed. There is a need for the authorities to have a sharper focus on this, for women to be given the right help and, above all, for the perpetrators to be given the right help. There are no easy solutions, and that is why it is so important that we get the work together on this, and the new action plan must ensure that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134705	Mrs. Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134707	But one of the things I find really problematic is that violence-stricken women fear losing both their children and their homes throughout the course to which they are subjected. The Red Cross has actually called for us to make such a statutory aid package. SF has also made a number of offers in this regard, including: That aid should also be there, even if you are not enrolled in a crisis centre, and that we should offer free psychological assistance for victims of partner violence. What is the Minister thinking about those elements, and can the Minister become more specific in terms of what she imagines could be part of a partner violence package?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134747	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134749	The process we are now going to initiate is to call all the actors in this area, including having political discussions with parties, in order to ensure that we get all the good proposals in play; to get all the knowledge that is in the area into play; and also to have the courage to think new and to focus on what ultimately leads us to seek help at a crisis centre, regardless of whether it is out-patient or whether you become a resident of a crisis centre. It is important that we focus on this very, very early, and we must help each other with that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134827	Mrs. Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134829	It wasn't so concrete. I think I have a very specific proposal, namely that aid should not depend on whether or not you live in a shelter. I think it is a big problem that we should not do that. An outpatient counselling service should be available outside the crisis centre so that you can only move in with your network if it is a better solution for yourself. Would the Minister like to take a look at this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134905	The Minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134905-2	I certainly believe that out-patient services are important, and several of the crisis centres are already offering them. It is important that you can get help early, even before you end up moving to a shelter. But the important thing here is also that we get all good ideas in play, because what we have the greatest desire for is to avoid situations where a woman is subjected to violence and needs to seek help. We would like to see this much earlier before it actually leads to something that escalates.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134943	Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt, last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302134944	It sounds as if the Minister would like to look at many things, but I would like to go one step further, and I think out-patient counselling services are extremely important. Then I have one last question. One of the things I also think is very unfair is that if you are subjected to violence, you are in fact in danger of having a psychological bill with an own payment of 40%, and that cuts off at least some people because they simply cannot afford it. Does the Minister also think that this is unfair and will the Minister do something about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135014	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135015	I'm not going to start by closing doors. I think the important thing is to open all the doors to all good proposals that come into play and put a spotlight on the challenges that are in this system. And I sincerely believe that this is the right approach to take. I also believe that we should put a spotlight on some of the countries that are a few steps ahead of us in this area, and there are countries that are. So the phase we are entering now, I think, is about clarifying this area and getting all good proposals in play, but the goal is very clear, and that is that something needs to be done about this problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135049	The question is over. Thank you to the Minister and thank you to Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt, SF. The next question has been removed, and that is why we have now come to questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration, and the questioner is Mr. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135102	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135103	Thank you, President. Does the Minister believe that the government should do more to secure and maintain the necessary foreign labour from Danish companies, including by changing the amount regime?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135117	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135118	Thank you for the question. Let me start by saying that I agree that it is the government's job to secure the necessary labour of Danish companies. It is important for the government that companies have the opportunity to recruit also foreign labour. International staff are of great importance to the economy and to the Danish economy, and that is why the government, together with the Radicals, the SF and the Christian Democrats, has also decided that a draft law should be tabled on a new temporary amount scheme, which among other things. to help the shortage of labour that we see in Danish society now. We are planning to table a legislative proposal in the latter half of April.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135157	Here you go, sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135158	Thank you. I am sure the Minister knows that the reason why I am specifically asking about this is a fantastic company in Hedensted, which is called NATURES Collection, and which among other things. producing lamb skins and where a Chinese key employee after 10 years stands to be deported from Denmark because the spouse, who is also Chinese, for 1 month • 1 month • 1 month smoked below the limit of the amount that is, for how much to earn, and it was well to notice because of corona. This is an absurd situation. The family also has a daughter of 11 years of age who has lived almost all his life in Denmark, and they are now going back to China. That's why I'm sorry that the government didn't want to cooperate with us before to lower the limit in this payment scheme... something that could, at least hopefully, have helped this family. And just to make it clear: the bill that the Minister is going to table is not bound up with everything else, which the Minister knows will not be edible for us blue parties, because then we are in the same position, because then there will probably not be a majority for this in the Folketing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135305	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135306	Thank you. Our proposal is to create an additional amount scheme that will operate over a limited number of years and where the limit on how much you have to earn in order to obtain a residence permit will be set at DKK 375,000, including holiday money and pension. So that's a significant reduction from the current, that's 448,000 kr. After all, there are some requests from the government that it should work within the normal terms and conditions of employment that we have in Denmark and that the salary should be paid to a Danish bank account. If there is anything that prevents the bourgeois from voting in favour, I will of course be sorry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135342	Sir. Marcus Knuth, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135343	If I may ask specifically about this matter, which I think the Minister is aware of, where the two Chinese employees here have been in Denmark for 10 years and are facing expulsions, including with their daughter, among others. because the rules do not provide an exception for a short-term reduction in wages due to the corona situation. Is there anything the Minister can and will do so that they do not have to be expelled from Denmark after 10 years of stay, where they have been key employees in this good company, namely in NATURES Collection?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135413	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135415	I only know the story from the media and, of course, cannot relate to a specific case here. But I can say that when you assess whether a residence permit should be included, you also stress whether the people it is about have been here for so long that they have been associated with Danish society, and there it is also important whether you have children who have grown up in Danish society and have gone to school in Denmark, and that sort of thing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135441	Sir. Marcus Knuth, last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135442	I would just like to call on the Minister, when he looks at this bill, to also look at some of the wrong things, such as the fact that the Corona situation is not a legal excuse for a quite short-term reduction in wages or the fact that if you are two spouses who together live up to the amount scheme but one is just below, then you have to deport after 10 years, especially when it is the case that you have a child of 11 years, who is now going to have to leave the country that is basically the only one she knows.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135512	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135513	As I said, I only know the story from the media. But from that point of view I must understand that the matter has also been referred to the Foreign Affairs Council, which is the appeal body, and then it is up to them to decide whether the residence permit should be withdrawn or whether it should be extended. I do not think they have decided yet, but it may not take too long for that to happen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135540	Thank you. The question is closed. We will continue with both the same minister and Mr. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135548	Please read the next question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135550	What is the Minister's view that a large number of young people aged between 18 and 23 who obtained citizenship from 2010 to 2014 have subsequently received a criminal conviction, including 45%. of the young stateless persons, 21%. of young Pakistanis and 20% of young Pakistanis. by young Iranians?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135609	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135611	Here, too, I would like to thank you for the question. It is, of course, a statistic that confirms a picture that we are unfortunately already aware of, namely that we have a special challenge for integration with those who have come here, particularly from the Middle East and Africa. Young men are over-represented in crime statistics and women are under-represented in employment statistics. This is also the reason why we have introduced this new MENAPT category, which is a statistical category which is now used in citizenship surveys and the Ministry of Finance's inventory and Danmarks Statistik. Generally speaking, I can say that the granting of citizenship to foreigners is a declaration of confidence by the Danish community here in Parliament, and if you have acquired Danish citizenship, you must of course behave properly and respect the values and laws and principles on which this society is based. We have therefore gradually tightened the rules for Danish citizenship, most recently last spring, when the government, together with the Left, the Conservatives and the Liberal Alliance, changed the rules and tightened the rules on when citizenship can be acquired. In the light of that agreement, it is proposed, among other things, that: In the draft law amending the law on citizenship, which was tabled back on 10 February, a provision is made that a person convicted of a criminal offence who has thereby behaved in a manner which seriously harms Denmark's vital interests must be denied his Danish nationality by judgment, unless it would be contrary to international conventions. It is our view that you have nothing to do in Denmark if you commit such a criminal offence, which is therefore seriously detrimental to Denmark's vital interests. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135755	Sir. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135756	Thank you. These figures come from a number of questions I have put to the Minister. I have to be honest with you, I was shocked when I saw these numbers. Well, 45%. of stateless persons, i.e. most often Palestinians, 21%. of Pakistanis, 20%. by Iranians commit crime after they have acquired Danish citizenship. I think we should clearly do something about that, and I hope the Minister will back me there. All legislation, or a circular, which is the case for citizenship, is something that we are constantly changing when it is the case that we see big knots. Now that we see these hair-raising statistics, will the Minister cooperate with us Conservatives so that we tighten up massively so that hopefully all these people will not get citizenship at all?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135844	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135846	We are quite satisfied with the agreement on the granting of citizenship that we reached last spring. Many of the people who have acquired citizenship, according to the answers I have sent to the questioner, have also received it in the past, in other words under some previous circulars, some previous rules on how to obtain citizenship. I also think that the table shows us that it is typically nations from which we have received many refugees, and there are young people who get citizenship at the age of 18 and who subsequently commit crime.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135922	Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135923	So we see a very clear pattern here. That's 93 percent. of those aged 18-23 who are not EU nationals. That shows that something is completely wrong. That's one of them. Because of the loophole in the law about permanent residence. This can be achieved when you are between 18 and 19, without having to live up to, for example. employment requirements. So if we closed that loophole and removed the possibility of permanent residence in the 18-19 age group on lax rules, then we would be able to get rid of this. Will the Minister cooperate with us on this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135956	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302135957	There are pros and cons of everything, but I am quite happy with the rules we have that allow young people, when they are 18 years old, to apply for a permanent residence permit in Denmark unless they have committed serious crime and such things. But that is the case without them being in employment for 31⁄2 years, as we normally demand. Because that would just mean that young people who have been linked to their parents' residence permit when they are 18 can only be here on a temporary residence permit, perhaps until they have finished their education at 25 and then have worked 31⁄2 years; then they will be 30 years before that happens. I don't think we can be familiar with that. I think it is fair that a permanent residence permit can be obtained there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140031	Sir. Marcus Knuth for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140033	But that is probably the fundamental difference between Conservative and Social Democracy. Why is it that you, for example, if you... have come here as young Somalis, just need a permanent residence permit on the day of your 18th birthday, without any demands being made? I don't understand. We see time and time again that the second generation of those who have come here are doing worse than the first generation. You just want to hand out a permanent residence permit without making any demands. Then you cannot be amazed afterwards, when it is the case that people are doing worse in relation to the labour market and are high in crime statistics.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140104	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140105	But can it be said to an 18-year-old person that he cannot obtain his permanent residence permit if he has not had 31⁄2 years of full-time employment? I started working full-time very early, but I hadn't worked 31⁄2 years full-time when I was 18 years old. In that case, you have to drop out of eighth grade and get a full-time job. I don't think so many people do. That is why I think it is fair that we have these lax conditions for the 18-19-year-olds, where they are not supposed to live up to these 31⁄2 years of employment. After all, it is no different than it was when the Conservatives sat in government just a few years ago.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140138	The question is over. Thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration, and thank you to Mr. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party. The next question is to the Minister for Home Affairs and Housing, and that is what Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140146	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140151	The question is: Will the Minister be willing to grant a derogation to the construction of the mackerel factory in Fjellerup when both the municipal council of Norddjurs Municipality and the developer want to transform the existing Strandkro into a new tourist site that will create jobs, attract tourists and beautify the area?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140212	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140214	In 2015 the Municipality of Norddjurs was authorised for an experimental project in the field of coastal and natural tourism, and it includes among other things: binding path paths, posts for play, new bathing bridge and restoration of historic building. That authorisation for the project has been extended until November 2022. As you know, the Plan Act was agreed in 2016 and in 2020 the Plan Act was amended to allow for minor amendments to the initial authorisation. That is clear, among other things. of the legal notes that it will be necessary for an authorisation to be granted that the minor changes requested do not entail significant changes to the overall impact of the project on the environment. A modified use of the old mackerel factory and a new on-site settlement are not included in the municipality's initial application and therefore are not included in the 2015 authorisation either. There will therefore be talk of an entirely new element in the authorisation. And even if there is an existing building, a new settlement and a change in use will have a significant impact on, among other things: the nature and landscape interests of the Planning Act and the Nature Conservation Act rules on beach protection. The Housing and Planning Board has therefore considered that there are no minor changes to the authorised project within the meaning of the Act. And I have emphasized in my decision that there is therefore no legal basis for authorising the applicant. The Plan Act provides for the possibility that currently three non-implemented permits may be re-submitted. If there is agreement within the conciliation circle behind the Planning Act to offer new experimental permits, the municipality, in line with other coastal municipalities, will be able to apply for tourism companies in the mackerel factory.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140346	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140347	Thank you for that, or rather, it was not so positive, to put it mildly, Minister. Because the situation is that we have a completely decommissioned building that in no way embellishes the area out there. After all, what the municipal council is talking about, which is indicted in cross-party terms in their support for the project, is so small that it will not really go beyond the building framework of the overall project. And here we are with a developer who is simply willing to go out and say: we are now supporting a project in Norddjurs which will not only embellish it strongly out there in relation to the run-down building that stands there today but will also attract jobs to an area of our country that really needs new jobs and which, at the same time, is also something that will really show that something is happening in Fjellerup. We therefore have a collective municipal council which goes out and says: this is something we need; we have some citizens who very, very much want to have something prettier to look at; and at the same time we also have an overall project where something should already happen, where this could be inside, if you look at the concrete building framework of this kind. So what we are talking about is not something completely new and big and exciting that will change the entire coastline of Fjellerup. What we are talking about is so marginal changes that there are very, very many in Norddjurs who do not understand that the Minister is not a little more open to saying: okay. Well, then let's see if we can't grant a waiver when we already know that a lot of these exciting projects are going to happen in Fjellerup. I know, of course, that the Minister is usually a member of the Council, and I welcome that, in fact, who wants development to take place outside the major cities. Here we have the chance here we have the chance in Norddjurs Kommune. And that is why I can only appeal to the Minister to simply say, when one recognizes that it is within the framework of construction, that there is no possibility of a derogation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140542	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140543	But there is an opportunity to re-examine with a new application if we re-submit the existing one and those who re-submit it are, after all, the conciliation circle behind the law of plans, with which the Left, the author's party, sits, just as the Left Minister has helped to translate and make comments on the law of plans over the past six years; in fact, it can be said that the Left is as much as my own party who has drafted these rules. And one might also ask whether the Left should not be the ones to convey the considerations behind the rules, in that one has, of course, stood in the court of law, whether the many changes that have been made since then together with the Social Democratic Party, together with other parties.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140620	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140622	I mean, what's hard to say in good Jutland is that this project has only come now, and therefore was not with us when Norddjurs Kommune got the original project started. But if you put on the positive glasses too, and I hope the Minister does so once in a while, we now have the opportunity to say simply: Now we can really create something in Fjellerup. And it is not just me who is appealing to the Minister's own group chairman, who is elected on Djursland, who supports this project and has said that he wants it to be initiated. So will the Minister not listen to the group chairman?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140652	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140701	I certainly listen a lot to the chairman of the group, and I also listened to the mayor of the municipality of Norddjur, with whom I had a meeting last week. So it is not because I do not see the substance of this matter very well, and I would like to see more tourist development opportunities being created in Fjellerup as well. But it is the case that the four parties that are behind this draft law have wanted it to be arranged in this way, and if we want it in a different way, then we have to take it up in the conciliation circle. As recently as this morning, I raised this matter with the author's party colleague just to see what the possibilities were, and what is possible with the rules that have been made over the years is that there will be a new application when we re-provide.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140731	Last question. Here you go, sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140734	There should be no doubt that we in the Left want there to be freer and therefore more liberal rules on what is possible to build in such an area. So it is not we who are in any way slowing down such a project as the mackerel factory must be an option in the future. I would just like to try to clarify this, because I hear that there is a small door open, and I always choose to look at it with positive glasses, so would the Minister say that if you say in the conciliation circle that there is now going to be a re-offer, then the mackerel factory will be able to get into play there?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140804	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140805	It will, of course, be a process in which there will be different municipalities that have the opportunity to apply, and just as there is a broad majority in Norddjurs Municipality to create this opportunity, I think that, happily, there are many other places in the country correspondingly a majority across parties that want to be able to compromise on the nature protection that we have in some places. Last time there were 36 applications for the 10 permits, and there will probably also be many this time, but it is clear that Norddjurs must of course have the opportunity to search on an equal footing, and I hope you can realise the project you have in Fjellerup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140837	The question is over, but we will continue with both the Minister and the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140840	Here you go, sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen for reading the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140843	Thank you, President-in-Office, and the question is this: in the light of the answer to Question No. 456 explains whether the Minister considers that the proportion of rural residents should be decisive for whether a municipality can be included in the LAG pool without distinction to the actual number of residents and, on that basis, will the Minister grant a derogation so that Randers Municipality can continue to be included in the LAG pool?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140907	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302140908	A draft notice setting up action groups has been sent in consultation and it sets out the new criteria for municipalities, which from 2023 to 2027, can be designated as local action groups. I will, of course, decide, in the light of the consultation answers, whether the criteria should be changed, but I would also point out that fewer municipalities would be appointed in relation to the previous criteria, i.e. if they were retained. The main reason is that in general there has been an increase in the number of people employed throughout the country, including in rural areas, and I have therefore set out to adjust the criteria so that as many areas can receive LAG support, but also so that the municipalities most in need are designated. The mandatory criterion to be taken into account is that the area is not a major urban municipality. In addition, a municipality must fulfil one additional designation criterion out of four. I think it is most fair that the proportion of rural residents should be included as a criterion for whether this is a rural area in need of LAG funds. If, as the author suggests, the actual number of people living in rural areas is used, then large population-rich municipalities will automatically be able to be appointed more easily because they count many people. For example, the municipality of Randers has 31,000 people living in rural areas, while the municipality of Aalborg has 47,000 people. As long as there are many people living in municipalities with large cities that can drive development, it is not necessarily a problem that many people also live in rural areas. As can be seen from the answer to question 457, I will inform the rapporteurs whether the consultation answers give rise to a change in the notice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141040	Michael Aastrup Jensen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141041	Thank you, Minister. The answer is, of course, that with the new rules put in place by the Minister, Randers Municipality suddenly stopped being able to get these LAG pool funds. Randers Municipality is a rather special municipality because there is a larger city, Denmark's sixth largest city, but at the same time also a huge area, which is far away from Rander's city. It is rural areas; it is also something that lies many, many kilometres away from the larger city. At the same time, however, Randers Municipality is not a metropolitan municipality either. It's not a university community. Therefore, there are also a wide range of rural challenges in a municipality such as Randers. That is why we were very, very many who were both surprised, but also very sad that the Minister decided that now a municipality like Randers should not be included. This is not least in view of the fact that the alternative was then that it was a North Zealand municipality, Frederikssund, which was then given the opportunity instead. Because you could both go in and look at how many inhabitants there are in the rural area, but at the same time also go in and look at such things as income, which should also play a role when you go in and look at how we should ensure development outside the large cities. After all, I have praised the Minister once because I actually believe and believe that the Minister is fighting for something to happen outside the big cities. Here we have another example of the fact that, if the Minister changed his mind, we can actually take part in ensuring that something happens outside the big cities as well. If you look at the whole northeastern part of Randers Municipality, the west, the south, the east, etc., they don't have much together with the city of Randers. These are rural areas. That is why the Minister may say that the rules have been changed, but I have to say that with the rules that were there and if we look away from the problem of the city, it is 1% that decides, that is to say 1%. in relation to the number of inhabitants that should be in rural areas and that Randers should then fall on. I have to ask the Minister: is it not wrong that Randers in this way should fall out in favour of a North Zealand municipality?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141248	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141249	Basically, I think that in Østjylland we should be glad that things are going as well as they are, that is to say that you have huge economic growth and that you get more people in employment also in Randers Municipality. The reason Randers Municipality can no longer be in this scheme is because things are going so great. Development is created through great city council work and through leadership in the municipality. I just think that one should be aware that if we move the criteria so that Randers is within that one might well imagine was a wish... then you get other municipalities too. Well, then it is Herning, Silkeborg and Vejle, and then you can probably start discussing how much it is a rural scheme and how much it is a scheme for medium-sized Jutlandic cities, or in fact larger Jutlandic cities. And I think that is a concern.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141326	Thank you. Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141328	But the fact that you have been good at not least different governments over the years to create growth in the country is not what should be, what should you say, the main rule. It should be more of an income base. And if you go in and compare the income base in e.g. Randers Kommune versus the municipality of Frederikssund in Nordsjælland, I just have to say that there is a world different from the population of Randers Kommune is lower, not least if you go in and look at the rural areas of Randers Kommune. And that's why it should be involved in this, too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141402	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141403	Well, it's a story with several elements in it. Firstly, Frederikssund is a municipality whose largest city has approx. 20,000 inhabitants • the rest of the municipality are smaller towns. And if you want to compare income bases, you can take Odense and Aalborg, both of which have a less income base than Randers, and then you could reasonably say in Aalborg Municipality: Why shouldn't we have LAG funds? Or why should we not have it in Nibe ^ a municipality which has less income base and where more people live in rural areas? It is just going to be very big, and if it gets too big, we risk not really helping those rural areas that are most in need of it and which are those who may need this support.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141437	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, final question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141438	I believe that everyone can understand that university towns should not receive LAG pool support. However, compared to a municipality such as the municipality of Randers, where it is such land area, that in fact 32%. I have to admit that the Minister's own answer to me actually resides in rural areas, so there is still a world of difference. And that's why I still can't understand why Randers Municipality's rural area should lose to a northern Zealand municipality.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141511	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141518	I would very much like to invite the questioner to Hornsherred for Skibby and Hunter's Prize and look at the areas there. I think you will agree if you get up there, that it is not an area that is very gold-red and prosperous or any metropolitan area. It is rural in the same way as it is if you go to Langå, or if you go to Norddjurs, i.e. to smaller towns where you are together about the things that are there. So I think it is wrong to expose the municipality of Frederikssund as if it were such a wealthy municipality. And I fully recognise the huge work that has been done in relation to LAG funds in Randers Municipality, but I also see that Randers is really a place where there is great growth and you succeed super well in doing it yourself.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141546	The question is over. Thank you to the Minister, and thank you, Mr President. Michael Aastrup Jensen. That concludes Question Time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141602	The debate is open. Sir. Thei Chicken Hommeltoft, Social Democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302141617	Thank you. Today we are discussing a number of different good proposals in the field of health and, in particular, two of the proposals could have a very concrete impact on patients' access to medicines, and the third has become appallingly topical. One of the aims of the proposal is to ensure faster and better treatment in cases of opioid overdose in e.g. heroin addicts. We do this by creating a legal framework whereby nasal spray with naloxone can be dispensed by doctors and nurses to people outside the health care system. Extradition must be made to people who are close to drug addicts and who can step in and save lives. It can, for example, be done. be street workers, police officers or relatives of drug addicts. It is therefore both an important health and social policy measure in which we help some of the most vulnerable people in Denmark. Although the proposal is new, it is important to stress that, in fact, the scheme already works in practice in many places today and has done so in the last ten years without any examples of problems. But there is a need for a clear legal framework in order to continue to provide naloxone, and we are therefore creating it now. It is, of course, important that those who are given the medicinal product should also be qualified to treat the medicinal product and ensure that, after an overdose, the persons are treated by a doctor. However, the handing over of naloxone to front personnel is an important step in order to be able to start life-saving treatment quickly and early. In addition, there is the proposal for a new system of risk-sharing medicines. The proposal extends, as it were, the current experimental scheme on generally clause pharmaceutical grants on risk-sharing terms, which expired on 31 December 2021. The risk-sharing model is interesting, both because it can provide patients with support for new and possibly better medicinal products and ensure that we have medicines used more quickly in practice. At the same time, it benefits our life science companies, which also help to bear part of the costs if the costs are higher than expected. Therefore, there is also good reason why we challenge the model more. Unfortunately, the Agency's assessment of the first experimental system has not been able to produce clear conclusions, which is why we are now proposing a new four-year trial system, in which we are expanding the number of medicines in the system. I think that makes a great deal of sense, and hopefully it will ultimately help patients who are left with pain and discomfort on a daily basis. As the last and creepy moment, we have a change in the licensing law. It means that the Minister for Health can, in specific cases, lay down rules that the rules of the Authorization Act should not apply to the treatment of professional athletes or foreign military forces who bring their own doctor to Denmark. It is a natural consequence of our NATO cooperation that we create the opportunity for soldiers who are staying in Denmark to do so, for example. be on the exercise or on the way to other countries • can use their own doctor without having to go through a long authorization process first. The same may be true for professional athletes coming to Denmark, as when Denmark is to be the starting country for the Tour de France this summer. Of course, it doesn't make sense for a doctor to go through a long authorization process because you have to cycle 3 days in Denmark, among other things. past the Côte de Genner Beach in Aabenraa, or because you have to play a football game in the park. It is, of course, important to stress that these are very limited exceptions, and let me stress that it is still very important that as a patient in the Danish healthcare system, doctors who have the authorisation in order should be treated. Of course, this proposal does not change that. So, if I have to quickly sum up, these are three good proposals that strengthen access to medicines and facilitate some processes in our health services and that we, of course, support from the Social Democrats. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302142049	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we can go further in the line with Mr Beazley. Martin Geertsen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302142058	Thank you. And thank you to the government for presenting this little piece of legislation, which is divided into three different parts. The first part, as the previous rapporteur said, provides professional sports teams and foreign military forces with the opportunity to introduce medicines and use them on their own people here in Denmark without having to apply for permission from the authorities. That would remove some bureaucracy, and we in our party, by its very nature, think that is a very good idea. This will make it easier when, for example, we do so. organise international sporting events such as: Tour de France this summer, or if Denmark is to host NATO exercises or the like in the future. That is why, by its very nature, we fully agree with this part. The second part allows municipalities and civil society organisations to provide nasal spray with naloxone for the treatment of opioid overdose. And it's a really good idea, if you end up in a situation where you get an overdose, that hopefully in this way there will be better and perhaps above all faster access to treatment. Speed is of course important in this context in order to avoid that an overdose does not have serious and, in the worst case, fatal consequences. We also support the final part of establishing a new four-year trial scheme in relation to risk-sharing in the general subsidies for prescription medicines. After all, risk sharing is basically that the public health service covers the cost of subsidies for the number of patients in the target group, and it turns out that the medicine is being prescribed to more patients than the authorities have immediately assessed, yes, it is the pharmaceutical companies that have undertaken to cover the cost of subsidies for the additional patients. And the purpose of the experimental scheme is, of course, one of them. to allow patients to more easily have access to supplements. It was the previous government that introduced this experimental scheme back in 2018, which is why we are also pleased that the experimental scheme is now being extended. We particularly appreciate the extension of the scheme so that it will be possible to announce generally excluded grants on terms of risk-sharing for five medicinal products instead of the current two. And it is also positive that the government is proposing the introduction of such an ongoing rolling application deadline of two years. However, we note that the consultation response calls on various parties to allow pharmaceutical companies to provide so-called confidential price rebates in order to allow for generally-described subsidies where the price of the medicinal product is not proportionate to its therapeutic value. When we think that confidential discounts are a little interesting, it is also a question here of patients being able to access medicines with a general supplement, what otherwise they would not necessarily have received in a situation without discounts. I have also put a number of committee questions on this at an earlier stage, and I have also taken note of the answer, just as I note the consultation answers that have come to this bill. However, since it is precisely an experimental scheme that we must adopt and continue, I think that consideration should be given to including the issue of confidential price rebates in the experimental scheme. One might ask the question: if you were not to do so in an experimental scheme, when would you do so? And as I understand it, an experimental system could be set up in such a way that the Danish Medicines Agency would be able to refuse confidential discounts and agreements if it were uncertain whether it would have a negative effect on the price competition. And you will also be able to do it in such a way that the board will be able to stop an agreement if, contrary to expectations, it is restrictive of competition. Sweden, with which we usually compare ourselves in a number of areas, uses confidential agreements and price rebates for primary sector medicine, and therefore it should also be possible to gain experience from this. If this option were opened up, it might also be the case that patients would have more rapid access to prescription medicines with supplements, while the government would be able to buy medicines at the price which, according to the authorities' own assessment, corresponds to the therapeutic value. So on this point, we are ready, in some form or other, either to operate an amendment on the issue of confidential discounts, or in other ways to try to get some momentum in what is about the confidential rebates, in the work we are about to do in committee. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302142549	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur I see in the Chamber is Mr. Stinus Lindgreen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302142600	Thank you. After all, we have to deal with a three-part legislative proposal, as has already been explained by my good colleagues in this Chamber. The first part is about the treatment of professional athletes and foreign military forces staying in Denmark. It should make it legal for them to bring their own health professionals and their own medicine, etc. for their own use, of course under the applicable law on drugs, doping, etc. Today it is a relatively complicated process and the legislative proposal here makes it more flexible. Of course, we support that. Secondly, it is a question of dispensing and using nasal spray with naloxone to treat overdose with opioids. As has already been explained, it is a very great advantage. We have a high mortality rate due to overdose among drug users, and by relaxing the rules here we can save lives. It's a really good idea to open up this area. This will be of great help to some of the most vulnerable citizens we have in this country. In this context, it might be interesting to have an investigation carried out, and we will do so in the committee work.• How the rules are in other countries, whether there is any experience from there that we can take into Denmark so that we can help these vulnerable citizens in the best way possible. We shall ensure that this is the case in the committee's work. Finally, it is a question of continuing the trial scheme of pharmaceutical supplements on terms of risk sharing. This is, as I read it, a bottom-up task. We have had an experimental scheme which has expired here at the end of last year, and the Agency's evaluation shows that we cannot draw general conclusions on the basis of the experience we have from there. It therefore makes sense to extend it for four years and also to extend the number of medications from two to five. Of course, we support that. However, I also hear from the rapporteur from the Left that there may be other elements that might be interesting to look at in relation to confidential price agreements, and I think that is why we should examine this in committee and see if there is anything we should do there. We can also support that part from the Radical Left. Finally, I should like to say from the SF that they support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302142809	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. This means that we are moving forward in the rapporteur's line to Mr Beazley's report. Peder Hvelplund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302142822	Thank you for that, President. I can say, like the previous rapporteurs, that we will also be supporting this proposal. The only element I would like to focus on now is the excellent proposal that is about making naloxone spray, nasal spray, more accessible. After all, it is absolutely right that ensuring greater accessibility is a significant step forward in relation to drug users and people in the drug community in particular. That is why it is a proposal that can really help save human life. One aspect which I think is worth touching on, and which we will probably also have to look at in committee, is that this requires increased efforts, both by local authorities and civil society. It is, of course, the case today that efforts are being made by, among others. Antidote Denmark and Fixelancen, which delivers about 1,000 Antidote sets annually. And the assessment is that you should probably have 4,000 sets in the environment if it is to have a significant effect in terms of reducing the number of deaths associated with an overdose. It is clear that the efforts made by civil society also cost some money, and the appropriation now in the Ministry of Health expires here in 2022. So that is certainly something we should have looked at, in other words we should also ensure that, when we make such a proposal, there is additional funding, including for the work being done in civil society. I assume that is also something the government is willing to ensure, i.e. that it exists. Alternatively, at least this is something that we will also be able to bring up; it could, for example, be done. This could also be in relation to the negotiations on the social reserve. All in all, however, I think it is an excellent proposal, and I just think that when we make an effort aimed at drug users, we should ensure that we have sufficient funding to ensure that the necessary anti-dote kits also enter the environment. With those comments, Enhedslisten can support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143035	Thank you, sir. Peder Hvelplund. There are no brief comments to the Enhedslisten rapporteur, so the next rapporteur is from the Conservative People's Party. Here you go, sir. Per Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143045	Thank you for that, President. After all, this is a slightly mixed bouquet, which we will be supporting. One of the elements is the experimental scheme in the growth plan of the former government, the Left, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservatives, which together with the Danish People's Party and the Radical Left made an experiment on medicinal products, where it turns out, after the time that has now passed, that only two preparations have been included in the scheme, it has not been possible to make a valid evaluation, which is why it is natural to extend the scheme for a further four years, so that we can have some more preparations with and thus gather some experience. Then there are some elements of bureaucracy in different ways, which, of course, we also support. And then I understand that some questions are raised in committee, so we are naturally looking forward to having them answered and having a discussion in committee. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143157	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143222	Thank you. As a member of NATO, Denmark has undertaken that NATO countries should be able to treat foreign forces while they are in the country. It is also extremely important that we should be able to be a country that welcomes international athletes. When athletes come to Denmark, they help to brand our country, and besides helping to brand Denmark, they also help to boost our business community, hotels, restaurants etc., so we in Denmark of course want many sporting events to come to Denmark. With this proposal, we are helping to remove some of the bureaucracy by being able to come to Denmark. These are only health professionals for athletes and military personnel who bring their own health professionals and, in several cases, their own medicines, and, as I said, we are fortunately free of a lot of administrative trouble. If, then, with the proposal, we grant a derogation to allow them to bring their own health care professionals and medicines and that we can deliver nasal spray with naloxone, we just need to be absolutely sure of two things: we need to be sure that it is the health care professional in question who is responsible for handling naloxone, and not the nurse or doctor who has given it to them. We must also be sure that responsibility for the athletes and the health and safety of the military people rests solely on their health care professionals, so that the Danish health service does not have to take any risks. Once these requirements have been met, we in the Danish People's Party can support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143408	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. Then I cannot see any more rapporteurs in the Chamber, and that is why we are through the rapporteur's line and have reached the Minister for Health.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143421	Thank you for that and thank you for the good speeches and good comments. I believe that it was the rapporteur of the Left who called the draft law a small legislative package, and that is, in fact, correct enough. There are different elements in it, among others. to follow up on the previous risk-sharing test scheme in the medical grant system. It actually expired at the turn of the year, and it is one that we inherited from the previous government's life science growth plan. It was agreed in 2018, and there were many parties with it. Not all parties were involved, but all the parties actually voted in favour of the risk-sharing bill at that time. This is the experimental scheme that we are now proposing to renew in an extended version. So we are proposing a new four-year trial period. This is the same model that we have had up to now, but we are increasing the number of medicines in the system from two to five, and an ongoing application period is being introduced. There was previously a fixed deadline for applications. In other words, we are trying to allow even more companies to apply. The consultations have also given rise to an extension of the application period to two years. In addition, the bill proposes that travelling foreign health professionals be allowed to carry out treatment independently on foreign professional athletes when we hold major sporting events in Denmark. Several people have mentioned the Tour de France, which is quite obvious. After all, it is a very, very large event which will take place in Denmark this summer. But there may be other major sporting events, and we should hope so. That's what we're working for. In this proposal, we also propose that travelling foreign health professionals should be able to treat foreign military forces. It can, for example, be done. be at NATO exercises in Denmark. In this context, it is proposed that foreign health professionals should be given the opportunity to bring medicines so that they can use them for treatment without having to go through separate authorisations in this regard. Under the current rules, foreign health professionals cannot easily treat people in Denmark, and a separate authorisation must also be sought if you bring medicines from abroad to Denmark that are not for your own use, and it is not, of course, when you are employed in this way. So by excluding these health professionals from the Health Act, the Authorization Act and the Medical Act, among other things. NATO cooperation over the last few days and weeks has shown how important it is to become more flexible. This makes it easier for us to work with NATO, but of course it is also easy to be a host country at major sporting events. That's the part of the package here. In the latter part, the bill proposes that the rules for dispensing the medicinal product naloxone should be changed in order to increase the availability of naloxone to those who need it. It is quite specific that if you get an overdose of opioids it can, for example. It can be treated with such a nasal spray with naloxone. Therefore, the draft law proposes that doctors and nurses associated with drug abuse treatment may supply nasal spray with naloxone for the treatment of opioid overdose. And it's gonna be a free handover. This means that relatives of a drug addict may have naloxon on them. It will, of course, make a huge difference and provide greater security in the very, very difficult situation one is facing there. It is also proposed that doctors and nurses associated with a naloxone project in a civil society organisation should also be able to provide naloxone free of charge to relatives or to persons close to the drug abuse environment. I hope that the draft law will receive a good reading of the committee and, of course, I will answer any questions that may come from the committee along the way. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143852	Thank you to the Minister for Health. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Health Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143908	The debate is open. The first to speak comes from the Social Democrat rapporteur, Mr. Lars Aslan Rasmussen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302143928	This bill proposes to take the citizenship of persons who commit crime which is seriously detrimental to Denmark's interests. We in the Social Democratic Party believe that it is quite reasonable that persons who have been guilty of criminal behaviour which is seriously damaging to our country should have deprived their citizenship of course, provided that the person has dual citizenship and that this is done within the framework of our international conventions. The draft law also proposes that a person who has shown a so-called fraudulent relationship in connection with the acquisition of Danish citizenship should have renounced his nationality. In addition, it is proposed that his or her child should also have renounced citizenship if the child has become a Danish national through his or her parents. The bill follows on from two previous legislative proposals, so we have ensured that people who have dual citizenship and who have been left from Denmark as foreign fighters, or who have committed serious gang crimes, are deprived of their Danish citizenship. Common to all the legislative proposals is that they are based on an objective of emphasising that Danish citizenship is something very special that one should earn. And if you do not live up to your duties as a Danish citizen but, on the contrary, commit crime which is seriously detrimental to Denmark's vital interests, then of course you should have your Danish citizenship withdrawn. Social democracy supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144048	Thank you to the Social Democrat rapporteur. There are no brief comments, so the next rapporteur is from the Left. Here you go, sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144106	Thank you for that, President. In the Left, we want those who are granted Danish citizenship to really want to be Danish and that they really want to contribute to Denmark. For us, this has been the starting point for the ongoing adjustments we have made to the requirements for citizenship, because when we know that it is quite difficult to take citizenship from people again, it is just another argument that it is important to be careful with who they are assigning it to. But while we know that it can be difficult to take citizenship from a group of people, we should not fail to do everything we can, in cases where people, for example, are not able to do so. of course commit serious crime within the framework of the international conventions to which Denmark has committed itself. That is why we in the Left have been pushing for a long time for us to go harder on this issue. It was also a demand from the Left in the negotiations on citizenship that we had last year, and fortunately we obtained support from other parties, so now we are here today, where we can deal with a bill where we finally state that people with dual citizenship who, through crime, act to the detriment of the vital interests of the Danish state, must have taken away their Danish citizenship. Whatever form of crime it is if it is detrimental to the vital interests of the state, you must lose your citizenship. That is good Left policy, and we are pleased that it is now becoming Danish legislation. At the same time, the bill provides for people to be deprived of their Danish nationality if it has been achieved by fraud, and this also applies to those who have acquired citizenship as secondarys, but not if they are made stateless as a secondary. We think that is only fair, because of course we should not be able to cheat on citizenship here in Denmark. That is why the Left supports the proposed legislation. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144304	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Sir. Peder Hvelplund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144307	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur for the speech. I just need to hear about something. Now the rapporteur says it is a good Left policy. The fact that people are punishing others for acts they have not committed themselves, that is, the fact that children can be deprived of citizenship on the basis of their parents' actions, is also an expression of good liberal policy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144327	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144328	It is the case that something illegal may have been committed. Let me take this example. If a parent robbed a bank, stolen 100,000 kroner, kept 50,000 kroner. Even, given 50,000 kroner. For his child, it is not the case that we, as a community of law, go in afterwards and say that it was not the child who committed the crime, so you are allowed to keep the $50,000. That is why we think it is quite fair that if you have acquired citizenship as a secondary to a person who has acquired citizenship by deceiving and cheating, then your citizenship is naturally also withdrawn. Of course not, if you become a stateless person, because we have no interest in making children stateless. But, of course, one should not be able to speculate about cheating on citizenship, either for oneself or for one's children.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144419	Sir. Peder Hvelplund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144420	Now there is a difference between whether a crime has been committed and whether you get an immediate benefit from it. There are, of course, some children here who, without having committed an illegal act and completely ignorant of what parents might be able to do, are being punished for it. That is a breach of the principle that you are only punished for your own actions and not punished for what others might do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144442	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144444	No, it is not really, and I think that the example I gave before holds up. In other words, if a parent commits some crime and thereby gives the child a gain as a consequence of that crime, then we would be a strange community of law if we said that we did not take away the child from any extra wealth or money, or whatever it is that has been achieved through crime, because it would affect the child. Well, if the parents steal a car and give the kids the car, then we'll take the car away from them afterwards. That makes quite a lot of sense.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144515	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144518	I would like to know how the Left imagines that this amendment of the law affects the work of the courts. In the past, the wording has been 'can' and now the wording is changed to'must'. Does the Left imagine that this means suddenly that the courts are guilty of matters which they have not previously recognised?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144547	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144548	It is difficult to predict, but at least now we are doing what we can, the legislator, so that in cases where crime is committed, which is detrimental to the vital interests of the state, it will also result in the withdrawal of Danish citizenship. This was, after all, a proposal that the Left brought into the negotiations on citizenship because we were wondering why the law says today that if a person commits crime that is detrimental to the vital interests of the state, then the person may lose his citizenship. In other words, for us, it is quite obvious that if you commit such serious crime, then you can't lose your citizenship, so that you can't lose your citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144627	Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144629	What does the Left think of the fact that it is actually the case that the courts impose a relationship when the relationship has been brought before the court? What does the Left think about doing so, whether it says "can" or "should" in that provision?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144645	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144646	Well, I would say that it should be quite new and, I would say, a political break on the part of the Radical Left, if it really is the position of the Radical Left, that everywhere in the legislation, where there is now either a chance or a need to change the words, all you have to do is swap the words because it has no meaning. Of course, it has a meaning in terms of what you do. And we are sending a very strong signal here from the Danish Parliament, and we are making legislation which states that if you commit crime which is detrimental to the vital interests of the state, you must:
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144717	Thank you. Then Mrs Mette Thiesen has also asked for a brief comment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144721	Thank you for your speech to the rapporteur of the Left. We've discussed this before. When this is the case with the vital interests of the state, which is something that comes from the Convention on Civil Liberties, it will probably be quite, very few who end up being affected by it here. There are some pretty grotesque examples in the context of the Convention on Civil Liberties where someone who may have committed 23 murders in connection with a gang dispute will not be able to have his or her citizenship withdrawn, but if he or she commits one in connection with an act of terrorism, the person may be deprived of it. Does the Left honestly believe that the Convention on Civil Liberties benefits Denmark and the Danes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144800	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144802	We believe that it is in Denmark's very clear interest that there is an international rule-based society governed by international conventions which Denmark has signed up to. We do this because we are a small country, and the alternative to it is an international society based on the right of the strong, and although we like to think highly of ourselves here in Denmark, and I can also do that, we are not the strong ones, so yes, we think it is in Denmark's interest that there is an international rule-based society. But I do think that Mrs Mette Thiesen has an interesting point in relation to the type of crime that is detrimental to the vital interests of the state, and that is, in fact, why we on the Left have been pushing for this bill for some time. If you take the example of gang crime, as Mrs Mette Thiesen herself promises in the discussion, this is one of the areas that we actually hope will be able to come under the provisions on damaging the vital interests of the state in the future. Because we just have to recognise that when we look into society, gang crimes are so gross and so extensive a character that I would think it could be detrimental to the vital interests of the state.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144906	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144907	Thank you. I know that the Left, among other things. We have also put forward a proposal on this in this Chamber. So thank you for that, too. But it will still be quite a few who come under that paragraph. If, for example, a foreigner has come to Denmark, he receives Danish citizenship, the greatest gift we as a country can give, goes out and commits a murder, perhaps even more, does not the Left honestly believe that he should have lost the trust of Denmark and the Danes and lose his Danish citizenship? Does the rapporteur not honestly believe that the Convention on Civil Liberties stands in the way of our being able to take care of Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144949	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302144950	I fully agree with what Mrs Mette Thiesen said before, that Danish citizenship is a precious, if not the most precious gift that you as a foreigner can get from the Danish people, and that is why you also have to meet some requirements in order to get that gift. Just as you have to behave properly to get a gift on Christmas Eve, you also have to meet some requirements here. And, of course, we also have an expectation, as a society, that the laws of society will be observed afterwards, but if we do not do so, there must be a consequence, and in the Left we want that consequence, of course, to be as hard as possible, but within the rules of the international community to which we subscribe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145027	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145029	What we are talking about quite specifically, in relation to these international commitments that Denmark has submitted to, is of course among other things. Palestinians who do not have citizenship and, therefore, as Denmark has said, they will commit themselves to granting Danish citizenship. That's where I'd like to hear sir. Morten Dahlin on how it is that it would shake the international legal order if Denmark did not do so, i.e. if we, for example, were to do so. followed Britain. How exactly is it that the international community would be harmed by this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145100	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145102	Thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmidt for the question and also to give me the opportunity to discuss some of the differences that exist between how the Danish People's Party analyses the international order of rules and how the Left does so. We absolutely believe that it is in Danish interest that there is an international rule-based society governed by a number of conventions that free countries have signed up to, because the alternative to that world order will be a world order where it is the law of the strong that prevails. And Denmark is just not the strong player in this context. That is why we are pleased that there is an international set of rules that we must play by. Does this mean that, in total, we are satisfied with all the judgments that fall and that we think everything makes sense? No. And that is why we have also made it clear that we think that Denmark should take action, and we think that the government should do so when necessary; so that where it is not in the interests of Denmark and the individual, we actually have the opportunity to challenge them and hopefully change them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145206	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145208	I think sir... Morten Dahlin is mixing things up a little, because the UN Convention on the fight against statelessness does not have a court of law. So, the UN does not have a judicial system, so what exactly is it for a court that we should submit to and have an interest in keeping our hands under, etc.? The United Nations Convention to Combat Statelessness is only one great distrust to Mr. Morten Dahlin and his 178 colleagues with a claim that they are not able to solve the tasks, and therefore someone has cemented the time of 1961 firmly. I just don't think that makes much sense, which is why I don't understand either. Morten Dahlin's picture with courts etc. What kind of UN court is he talking about?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145247	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145249	So let's get to that part. Now I used my speaking time before to make clear where there was a difference between the Danish People's Party and the Left. As far as any of this is concerned, sir. Morten Messerschmidt says here, I think I can spend the rest of my time saying where I think there is some agreement. Just when sir... Morten Messerschmidt says that you've frozen the picture of what the world looked like a number of decades ago, so I think that's right. In fact, I also believe that it is in part a proper analysis that this is what we are experiencing with some of the international conventions. That is why we have an obligation, as Parliament, to challenge the conventions, to join with like-minded countries and to see if they can be moved where something is not in Denmark's interest. A future Left Government will also work for this, and I am sorry that the current one is not doing so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145330	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is from the Socialist People's Party. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145340	Let me start by stating that, as long as no one is made stateless or breaks any conventions, we share in the SF the intention that we should be able to deprive the citizenship of adult people who commit crime of such a serious nature that it threatens Denmark's vital interests. As I have mentioned in previous speeches, when we have debated this, it is not a position that we take lightly. Taking citizenship from people is extremely serious. That is why I think it is sensible that the draft law here should be framed and limited to precisely this definition, that it should seriously harm the vital interests of the country. This can only mean that it is in very rare and extremely serious cases that this possibility must be used. When we support this starting point, it is fundamental because when people say that the Danes want a strict immigration policy, what they really believe is that the Danes do not have the patience that there are not enough consequences of violating Danish hospitality and committing very serious crime. Indeed, I believe that the vast majority of citizens in this country really want to help refugees and are generally hospitable, but people who commit extremely serious crimes do not have much to do, and I can understand that. Therefore, it is also SF's policy to make it clear to people who commit serious treason or operate for foreign intelligence services in Denmark and who threaten our vital interests that they are not welcome here. We are therefore not opposed to extending the possibility of depriving hardcore criminals of their nationality if they commit such serious crime that it poses a danger to Denmark's most vital interests. The problem with this proposal we are dealing with now is that it could potentially hit other than the hardcore criminals. It can affect children. And I think it is quite wrong that the government has arranged the proposal in this way. To this one might say: Well, the child should never have had citizenship in the first place, if the parent has achieved it because of fraud. That's it, too, sir. Morten Dahlin argued before. I have to say here that if you know the so-called passages, you also know how destructive it can be to have constructed your entire life after a Danish citizenship and then to be told afterwards that you got it by mistake and have it removed. It is, of course, only the parents' responsibility if it surpasses the parents themselves as a result of fraud, but I simply do not think that we can afford to hold it against the child. Children should not be held responsible for or have their lives destroyed because of their parents' decisions if we can prevent it. If this proposal had been cleared of consequences for innocent children, I think the SF could vote in favour of it, but this is not what it is now, and so we cannot support it. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145707	Thank you. There are a few brief comments, first from Mr. Peder Hvelplund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145711	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur for the speech. I am particularly pleased with the last comments made by the rapporteur on the withdrawal of citizenship of children. I would really like to hear one thing when the rapporteur says this with the vital interests of the state. In other words, there is also a slippage in these years, in relation to what is considered to harm the vital interests of the state, and we have dealt with legislative proposals in the past, among others. gang crime is considered to harm the vital interests of the state. And I would just like to ask whether the SF rapporteur agrees that we are currently seeing some sort of slippage in relation to what is considered to be the vital interests of the state, i.e. where, for example, we are now seeing some sort of slippage in relation to what is considered to be the vital interests of the state. gang crime is also seen as damaging the vital interests of the state, and it is not in the same ball street as some of the other things mentioned by the rapporteur. The rapporteur then agrees with that, for example. gang crime should not be regarded as damaging the vital interests of the state?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145807	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145808	I think it depends on what kind of gang crime you see, i.e. how serious it is. Well, compared to being a member of a gang, maybe we're not exactly out there. Nor is it merely written to the detriment of the vital interests of the State; it is written to the grave detriment of the vital interests of the State. And I think that this has been very much affected, but I was actually also thinking that we should ask the government questions to find out exactly what it is covering up, that is to say, the matter of serious damage to vital interests. Because I think that wording is quite basic, but it is clear that if there is a slipping in the interpretation, as Mr. Peder Hvelplund fears here, it may well create some problematic things, in terms of whether we think you can go that way entirely. So we're going to hear the government about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145851	Sir. Peder Hvelplund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145853	I am glad to hear that, because I think that what we are experiencing at the moment is that there is a gradual departure. And we also see it in this bill, where we go in and give the courts a mandate to do so, instead of it being something where you can say that it is a balance on the part of the courts, in relation to whether you can do so. So it's just a receipt that I'm glad that the SF is also aware that there's not going to be a slip on this point and that we just have to make sure that having citizenship taken away is something that should only happen in very rare cases.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145927	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145928	Yes, and that is exactly what we would like to see: it is not something that has to happen often, and it has to be in a lot. However, when we have these very serious cases of serious damage to the vital interests of the state, we also think that we can go where they say: then we will take away citizenship if they have a different citizenship and thus do not become stateless.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145949	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment from Mr. Lars Aslan Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302145953	Thank you to the rapporteur, also for seeing some positive things in the proposal. It's about this whole thing with the kids. As the rapporteur says, we have had a number of cases with some who, by mistake, have received it, and I think the rapporteur is a little likened to some who have cheated on it. In other words, does the rapporteur recognise that there is a slight difference between some parents, a father or a mother or both of them cheating on it and that there has been a mistake on the part of the authorities where they thought they had it? Can the rapporteur see that there is a problem, if it is 10 000 or 20 000 people who have been cheated on citizenship, and that it can be a major problem, even for those who have actually legally acquired it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150022	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150023	Yes, I recognize that there is a difference between mistakes and cheating, but when it comes to the deprivation of children's citizenship, it is not a matter of cheating as such, because the children have not cheated anyone. It's their parents who have done it. That is why I think the cases are comparable because the children are innocent. They are suddenly told one day that the citizenship for which they have designed their entire lives is no longer valid, and it puts them in an extremely difficult life situation that can potentially be devastating for their lives because they have built their entire lives and lives around citizenship. That is why I think it is so serious to deprive people of their citizenship and to be extremely careful about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150107	Sir. Lars Aslan Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150109	But I don't understand it when it's that we're talking about people who have dual citizenship. In other words, does the rapporteur seriously believe that one is going to destroy one's life? I mean, if I had a Turkish citizenship and a Danish citizenship and you find out that I had cheated on it, do I get my life ruined by the fact that I still have citizenship in another country? We are talking here about people who have a double citizenship, not that they become stateless. But I do not think that you get your life ruined because you have citizenship in another country too. There are indeed many resident Danish citizens who have the nationality of two countries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150136	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150141	The rapporteur says that if it were found that I had cheated on it, then the rapporteur had cheated on it. That's not the point. Now we're talking about kids and finding out that their parents have cheated on it. The children are then affected, and that is problematic. And yes, I think you can actually get something near ruined your life by having your citizenship taken away, even if you have another. If you are 17 years old and have dual citizenship, but all you know is Denmark; you speak Danish; you do not speak the language of the other country, where you have citizenship and all such things; you are deprived of your Danish citizenship and have to move to a country in which you practically do not know and do not speak the language, then I think it is very intrusive for your life.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150217	Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. Then we move on to the Radical Left rapporteur, Mrs Susan Kronborg. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150229	Thank you for the floor. The bill deals with two matters. The first amendment concerns the disqualification of Danish citizenship acquired by fraud, according to Section 8 A of the Law on the Rights of the Birth. As the rule is now, the courts may disclaim citizenship if fraudulent circumstances have been found which have determined the acquisition of nationality. The Government has here proposed to change from a "can' clause to a "must' clause. It is clear, therefore, that disqualification must be mandatory for the courts, but, on the other hand, the courts must not disclaim when it is contrary to international obligations, nor can the courts disclaim when the disqualification will be involuntarily. It is my view that the amendment of the law in this respect has no substance, as does the amendment of Paragraph 8 B. The second amendment amends the rule of disqualification of Danish nationality on the basis of crime comparable to terrorism, according to Paragraph 8 B. The Courts still make the same assessment and the courts make that assessment when the State has used its public appeal. Therefore, the scope and scope of the measure do not have any substance for the courts. The Courts shall carry out the assessment after the public appeal has been made, whatever the term may or shall be used. If a relationship is indicted, it is not the case that the court does not rule on an indictment. After all, the Court of Justice takes a position whether it says'may' or'shall'. What matters is whether the relationship has been appealed to the court. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150417	Thank you. There are no brief comments to Mrs Susan Kronborg, so we thank the radical rapporteur. Then it is the Enhedslisten's rapporteur, sir. Peder Hvelplund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150428	Thank you for that, President. It is true that every time there is a new proposal in the area of citizenship, there is usually another tightening of the rules. It is not rare to change the rules. As several of you in this room have mentioned innumerable times, you think that Danish citizenship is a gift... a fantastic gesture... we as a country can offer other people, if they behave completely as we would like them to. Such an approach to citizenship and other people is by no means in line with reality or in line with Enhedslisten's view. People who happen to be born elsewhere are neither wrong nor too bad to be citizens of this society. They certainly have as much right to vote in an election or to stand for election as everyone else has. And if there is something that is at least not fair, then if their options are limited, it is solely on the basis of where their parents or grandparents are born. The constant restrictions on access to citizenship are both contrary to our international obligations, but certainly also contrary to the fundamental values on which our entire democracy is based. When today we are in a situation where 15%. The citizens of the capital have no opportunity to assert their influence, because our rules of citizenship are so strict, our democratic legitimacy is at stake. The more we tighten the rules, the higher the number of citizens without democratic influence will be. In 1980 it was 1.8%. of the population who could not vote; by 2020 it is up to 15%. in the metropolitan area and 10% in the metropolitan area; Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. What happens in the year 2040 if we keep tightening the rules? So we're up to 30%. of a non-voting population? Is it democracy when so much of the population is deprived of influence and when some sections of the population have the right to control others? I think this is a frightening development and I am, in fact, seriously concerned about our democracy in that context. This bill suggests that we should more often deprive people of their citizenship. If there is just the slightest chance of removing it, it must go away not only for someone who has committed something criminal, but also for his innocent minor children. In addition, the definition of serious damage to the vital interests of the State is a rather fluent term. With the legislation in force, it is at least linked to certain crimes, but now it must be assessed, every time any crime is committed, whether it is such as to deprive citizenship of its character. I think it is a waste of time for the courts, and I think it is a democratic problem when the legislation becomes so vague. With the constant austerity in the area of citizenship that we are in the process of doing, we are also in the process of destroying our democracy. And the consequences of all the austerity that has been adopted over the past few years will be that future governments will have difficulty legitimising their own exercise of power simply because they are elected by a smaller and smaller proportion of the population. That is why Enhedslisten cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150739	Thank you, sir. Peder Hvelplund. There are no brief comments to the Enhedslisten rapporteur, so the next rapporteur is from the Conservative People's Party. Here you go, sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302150755	Thank you very much. We think this proposal is very good. From the Conservative side we have long wanted it to be easier to deprive people of Danish citizenship by crime. We already have rules today so that we can take away citizenship, for example. from some of the women who joined the terrorist organisation Islamic State in Syria. This proposal is fine; it takes it one step further. Unfortunately, however, the reality is that, in relation to this proposal, a great deal of extremely large-scale crime is needed before it is actually going to be something that will happen in reality. Common and extremely severe crime will continue to be excluded. That's really too bad, actually. I have recently asked a lot of questions to the Foreign Minister, who shows that, especially stateless persons, Afghans, Iraqis and Turks, they often commit large-scale crime after they have acquired citizenship. We would rather see these people not having citizenship at all. That is why we will be dealing with a number of motions for resolutions in the near future. We have tabled motions for resolutions to tighten up the rules on permanent residence and citizenship. Because we feel that, of course, we want to help people who come here as refugees, for example. from Ukraine, which is temporarily fleeing from a war in our own vicinity, but we have therefore seen a great many migrants from the Middle East and from Africa come here over recent years. There it is like a three-step rocket: first you get a stay, then you get a permanent stay, and then you apply for citizenship in order not to go back home. That's exactly the three-step rocket we want to take a closer look at. There are, among other things: some fast-track schemes where you can just stay permanently at 18 without having met the usual requirements in relation to work. There are other loopholes for young people seeking citizenship, and we see that, in particular, the young category shows that the figures I have received from 18-24-year-olds commit large-scale crime after they have acquired citizenship. And it is mostly non-EU citizens who make use of these schemes. So we think it should be significantly harder to have permanent residence, and it should be significantly harder to get citizenship, because then we will not get into these issues of depriving people of citizenship afterwards. Those who commit serious crime should not have citizenship at all in the first place. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151026	There are a few brief comments. It's Mrs. Mette Thiesen first.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151029	Thank you so much. We can agree with the latter, because of course criminal foreigners should not have Danish citizenship. It's just common sense. So I fully agree with the Conservative rapporteur on that. But the problem is that there has been a completely misguided immigration policy and that Danish citizenship has simply been thrown around for decades. That's one of them. That is why we are standing here today. So will the Conservative People's Party help to ensure that far more people are deprived of citizenship? Among other things, you can. By resigning from this convention of national law. There is simply no reason for us to be in it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151107	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151109	We believe, as I said, that action must be taken before people acquire citizenship. I am sure that Mrs Mette Thiesen will also read some of the questions I have asked about who is committing crime before they have a permanent residence, after they have been granted permanent residence, before they acquire citizenship and after they have acquired citizenship, and the answers to them. It is in step one that we must take action. It's not when people get citizenship. It's going to be our focus for the next few months. New citizens can be sure that we have some good suggestions on the way that New Civil and Danish People's Party will be happy about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151139	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151140	Thank you. It just wasn't really an answer to the question. We are consistently voting against those who come from Muslim countries, because we know that both they and their descendants are more criminal than the Danes when they come here. So we have acknowledged that part. We have voted against all the legislation on citizenship, including the right to vote in local elections. for the same reason. However, I asked specifically about those who have been granted citizenship, who commit crime, also of a rather gross nature. If we were to abandon what is known as the Convention on Civil Liberties, we would actually have the opportunity to deprive them of citizenship to a much greater extent, in other words, those who have abused the Danes' trust and committed crime. Will the Conservative People's Party be involved in this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151221	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151222	I would say that is an interesting observation. Now it's free from memory, but I think that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt has put forward a proposal to make a service review of the Convention on Human Rights to see if there is anything that can be done in relation to its interpretation. That is also what the previous government was trying to do. Some countries have stepped out of it and stepped in again. I would then say that we are at least very open to looking at what can be done, but I will not stand here and say that we should just step out of a convention. Maybe that'll be just as violent as it is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151250	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151252	I would like to know if Conservatives are thinking that the bill restricts the jurisdiction of the courts.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151301	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151302	Okay, let me think about this for a second. No, I believe that this extends the powers of the courts, because it gives the courts some tools to take citizenship from not only serious criminals, but those in the toughest category, which is a threat to the security of the country. This gives the courts some tools that they did not have before, so I would say that it extends the powers of the courts.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151328	Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151329	Thank you for your answer. Then I would also like to know whether Conservatives believe that the legislative proposal has a real content.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151338	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151339	I must apologise for not being a lawyer like the rapporteur myself, so perhaps I have a slightly different angle, but it has a lot of real content, precisely that it extends the possibility of taking citizenship from people who have committed crime which is a threat to the security of the country. We would like the possibilities to be wider than that, but a little is also right.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151401	Then it's mr. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151402	On the question of the international conventions, Mr. Marcus Knuth, on the motion for a resolution that we have tabled, on a critical review of how we can, what can be said, loosen the stranglehold, but it is, of course, particularly in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights. The conventions which have a special role to play in the field of citizenship are, of course, UN conventions, which I mentioned a little along with Mr Gundelach. Morten Dahlin earlier. See, sir. Marcus Knuth and the Conservative People's Party with the same seriousness, so to speak, on the UN conventions, where there are no courts and where there is not the same legal structure as the European Convention on Human Rights? Could this be an area where we could perhaps work together to get Denmark out of full swing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151452	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151454	First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Morten Messerschmidt for the very proposal in the area of human rights, which makes it difficult to expel serious criminals from Denmark. So a service check is always sensible. That is also why our previous government set out to look at the interpretation of the very same convention. So I would say in advance that if it is the case that you can look at something with a different angle that can make the conventions used in a more contemporary and more relevant respect, we are, of course, always willing to look at it. That is also why I commend the rapporteur. But again: I do not want to stand on the platform and say that we should just step out of a convention, because the conventions have, in addition to some of the negative derived effects, many positive secondary effects in relation to international cohesion and the international playing field.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151545	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151547	Maybe I could just ask what it could be. In other words, one of the things that is being restricted here is the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. That is what prevents us from expelling criminal foreigners, that is, if they become stateless as a result. What is it quite concrete that the common Dane, who just wants to be at peace with criminal foreigners, gets from the fact that Denmark is part of that convention?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151615	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151615-2	Generally speaking, conventions help to ensure that we have international rules of play, and so what are international rules of play has a positive side. But the present and the reality we are facing, with migratory flows, etc. Unfortunately, the conventions sometimes fail to meet the present challenges we face. Specifically in relation to stateless persons, we see large-scale crime, and that is what we are saying: let us take action so that these people do not have permanent residence at all and therefore cannot seek citizenship either. So let us put it there too, so that they do not get citizenship either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151651	Thank you. Then I have no further brief comments to make. Thank you to the rapporteur. We shall now proceed to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party, and that is Mr Seligman. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302151705	Thank you, President. To a people they all belong, as they do to themselves. That's how Grundtvig talks about the Danish people, that is, that you have to want it, that you have to feel it. For the country of origin and for the mother tongue, the heart must beat. Unfortunately, it has to be said that for too many years this high point has granted birth rights to too many people on an excessively lax basis. That is why it is positive news that a willingness has now emerged even in the Social Democratic Party to correct some of the mistakes of the past. Unfortunately, we are still willing to become more and more involved in this morass of international agreements, conventions, treaties and rules, which have only one purpose: to restrict the Folketing from taking care of Denmark and gradually creating what is called an international legal order, that is. the winding-up of the nation state. That's basically what this is all about. When we talk about an international legal order, it is a question of the national authorities and national parliaments, which have historically been the firm anchoring of the popular and democratic soul, being forced back to the detriment of air castles such as the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly in New York, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, the Court of Human Rights, the European Union, and what do I know? All that in all its DNA alone has the extermination of the nation state as its purpose; that Denmark does not in itself have a purpose, a justification, that the Danes are merely a random group of people, who are now just in what was once thought to be called Denmark. That is the ideology behind the international conventions, which, of course, runs counter to everything that is Danish, what is national, and to Mr Vandemeulebroucke. Knuth's permission will allow me to say conservatively. That is also why it is strange that it is still a dogma among even conservative parties, of name at least, bourgeois parties, that this so-called international legal order must be more important than the fact that we can take care of Denmark. I do not know where that thought has arisen, but I would say that I will dedicate most of my life to fighting it both in writing and in speech. That's why, of course, we're a little ambivalent about this proposal. Because, on the one hand, we in the Danish People's Party will never vote against a proposal that makes it easier for the Danish authorities, the courts, to expel criminal aliens or to take citizenship from people who prove unworthy of the gift of Danish citizenship. On the other hand, it is annoying that one is then forced to vote in favour of proposals based on this misconception that Denmark is just a free in the air hovering construction, which must give way, must bow down to this international thinking. So it is, I would say, with a certain degree of ambivalence that we are of course voting in favour of the bill here, ambivalence, not because we do not want to take the nationality of foreigners who prove unworthy of the gift that it is to have the right of birth, but because this proposal and the whole idea that forms the basis of the agreement on citizenship made by the Socialist Government is, of course, that Denmark must stand up and be submissive to this so-called international legal order. I simply do not recognise that there is such a phenomenon in a field such as citizenship. Of course it is practical if we are talking about free trade or if we are talking about standardising energy supplies or anything else. We can talk about the need for an international legal order. It is only practical that, within an internal market, we agree on how many volts and amps there must be in the outlet, so that, if you are to shave during a holiday, you do not die because you have an electric shock. It's practical. But when it comes to questions about who has a right to vote in Denmark, who has a right to vote, who is part of the Danish family, there is only one rule, and that is: the Danes first. The Danes, who for a thousand years have been here and cherished this spot on the earth, are the ones who have the title. And if a misguided Parliament turns out to grant citizenship to people who are unworthy, then, of course, no international legal order should be able to prevent a new Parliament from correcting that error. So, with the words, Mr President, allow me to say that this is a step in the right direction, but unfortunately on a very, very long journey.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152141	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152143	Thank you. That is more a comment than a question, because it is rare for me to disagree with Mr McMillan-Scott. Morten Messerschmidt. But we do believe, in fact, that an international game order is not in direct conflict with the nation state as long as the international rules of play are contemporary, and that is the problem with the conventions that is that they are no longer contemporary. I mean, how many times have we here in the Folketing dealt with changes to laws because we constantly update our legislative programme. But we do not update the conventions so that they match the reality we are facing today. That was more of a consideration. Then I just want to say thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmidt to catch one of the many questions I have put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. I think that the figures that come out, among other things. 45%. by the Palestinians commit crime after they have acquired citizenship, all alarm bells ring. So I hope that the proposals that we will be making here in the future and we also hope that others will come up with similar proposals can put together a blue block and put pressure on the Minister to accommodate us; if only it will show that the immigration policy and the immigration restrictions we want are something where we are in the blue block somewhere other than the social democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152253	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152254	Thank you, sir. Marcus Knuth to help bring these facts out. If I may just make one comment on the first, I would say that I am looking at Denmark and there I think that Mr. Marcus Knuth and I will agree as a homeland and thus as something beyond ideology. Whether you are a radical, a social democrat or a liberal, you can see Denmark as a country of origin. Well, it's like an umbrella where we're united in something bigger than the ideological one. The conventions we are talking about here are, after all, an anti-national ideology. And I fully agree that if it is a matter of arranging trade in energy supplies or other goods, etc., you can have a practical arrangement. But it is not a practical arrangement for a country to submit to the granting of citizenship to people who prove unworthy. It is an ideology that belongs in the radical and emancipatory part of the Danish Parliament, and thus it should be something if I have to say it as a humble reply that the Danish People's Party and the Conservative People's Party could unite in being opposed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152401	Then there are no more brief comments and we thank the rapporteur. We move on to the rapporteur of the new citizens, Mrs Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152420	Thank you. When I first saw this bill, I was really pleased because I thought that the Social Democrats could finally support the idea that citizenship would be taken far more away from those who committed crime. The figures speak their own clear, clear language, and they show, among other things, that although non-Western descendants with Danish citizenship were only 2.8%. of the population per head of population per head of population per head of population per head of population per head of population per head of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year of population per year In 2020, a verdict was handed down 217 times for rape, and of the convicted were 53 persons foreigners, showing an inventory from the Ministry of Justice. Most of the sentences were handed down to Syrian citizens, who were convicted seven times in 2020. 53 out of 217 who were convicted of rape in Denmark in 2020 were foreigners, and that corresponds to 24 per cent. or just barely one in four, which is a strong over-representation. Sir. Marcus Knuth of the Conservative People's Party has asked some questions, as he said from the platform before, where there are also some numbers that speak their own very, very clear, clear language. It is basically just to read the horror release that comes every year about foreigners in Denmark, because then you can see many of these numbers, and therefore, of course, there is a need for action. However, I am very unsure how many of these proposals are going to cover precisely, as there is a great deal to be done before we are judged under the provision on serious crime which seriously harms Denmark's vital interests. My immediate offer will be very few, but it might be nice to get it qualified. New citizens, of course, support this. It is all very well to tighten up the legislation, and of course there should be no doubt whatsoever that for New Citizens it is more important to ensure the safety and security of the Danes than to safeguard obsolete conventions, because we are chosen by the Danes to look after Denmark, and we do so. But, of course, we want to go much harder than is done with this bill, and the whole argument about the vital interests of the state is based, for example, on the Convention on Civil Liberties, and of course Denmark should resign today rather than tomorrow. Other countries with which we normally compare ourselves have, in fact, never been as unreasonable as Denmark and have ratified it, and these are countries such as France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom. This convention is of no benefit to Denmark, on the contrary. The position of new citizens is quite clear: criminal foreigners must not only be denied citizenship, they must be shown consistently and after the first sentence, and then those who have been granted citizenship by law and subsequently receive an unconditional sentence of liberty must be denied their Danish citizenship by judgment and deported, and in addition, Danish citizenship should not be granted to immigrants and descendants from Muslim countries where we have statistical evidence that they commit crime much more often than Danes when they arrive here. We are, of course, voting in favour of this bill because, after all, it is a small step in the right direction, but we would like to go much further for Denmark. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152746	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. We can move on to the Liberal Alliance rapporteur, but since there is no one here, and there is no one on the side of the Free Greens, we are giving the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302152808	First of all, I would like to thank you for the debate on the legislative proposal. It is our view that you really have nothing to do in Denmark, if you commit a criminal offence which seriously harms Denmark's vital interests, and if you have cheated on your Danish citizenship, it must of course also have consequences. As the rules are today, one can be denied Danish citizenship by judgment, and this also happens if one is convicted of a violation of Chapter 12 of the Criminal Code on crimes against State independence and security, or Chapter 13 on crimes against the Constitution and the Supreme Authorities, terrorism, etc., or is sentenced under Section 81a of the Criminal Code on increased penalties for offences that have a background or are suitable to provoke a gang conflict and thus do not become stateless. The possibility of denying citizenship by judgment was last extended on the Government's initiative on 1 July last year, and in addition, in 2019 we took the initiative for a change of law that has made it possible to take administratively the Danish citizenship from persons who have taken a course of action that is seriously detrimental to Denmark's vital interests if it does not lead to statelessness. So far, 12 people have been deprived of their nationality administratively, and as far as the authorities know, none of them have entered Denmark subsequently, and that is the whole purpose. As you all know, on 20 April last year the government concluded a new citizenship agreement with the Left, the Conservative People's Party and the Liberal Alliance. It follows from that agreement that there is agreement to examine whether the area of disqualification of Danish citizenship due to crime can be extended, since the parties to the agreement agree that any possibility of extending, within our international obligations, the right to disqualification of citizenship should be fully exploited, in order to ensure that disqualification takes place as far as possible. In addition, it is proposed that a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who has thereby shown such a course of action which is seriously detrimental to Denmark's vital interests should be able to be denied his Danish nationality by judgment. In such cases, disqualification shall be compulsory unless it would be contrary to international obligations. The possibility of denying Danish citizenship by judgment will therefore no longer be limited to specific criminal matters, but will depend on whether the specific offences constitute a course of action which has seriously prejudiced the vital interests of the State. In addition to the criminal offences currently covered by the rules on disqualification, there will, in the circumstances, be the possibility of disqualification by a conviction of serious and widespread drug crime and public approval of terrorism, which has seriously prejudiced the vital interests of the State. Another example could be an attack on the energy sector, which leads to a long-term breakdown of the power supply in larger parts of the country and, as a result, has serious and extensive social damage. However, it will always be up to the courts to assess in concrete terms whether there will be criminal offences which seriously harm the vital interests of the State. The Government also wants the possibility of disclaiming the nationality of persons who, in connection with the acquisition of Danish citizenship, have shown fraudulent circumstances to be exploited as far as possible. It is therefore proposed that, in future, Danish citizenship acquired by fraud should be refused by judgment, unless it is contrary to international obligations. As a result of the proposed amendment, in cases relating to the disqualification of nationality, it will therefore be compulsory for the nationality to be refused if, in the course of his acquisition of nationality, he has been guilty of fraudulent acts and the facts of his acquisition have been determined. Finally, it is proposed that if a person is deprived of his or her Danish nationality by judgment on the grounds of fraud, his or her child must also be deprived of his or her nationality by judgment if the child has acquired his or her nationality through him or her, unless this would be contrary to international obligations or unless the child becomes stateless. It is the government's view that disfellowshiping the child to statelessness would be an unreasonable and inappropriate consequence of parental action, because it could have serious consequences for a child who, on the basis of the fraudulent actions of a parent, is denied Danish citizenship to statelessness and, unlike the child, the parents would have shown a fraudulent relationship in connection with the acquisition of citizenship. I now look forward to the further examination of the bill here in the Danish Parliament and, as always, I am available both in this Chamber and in the subsequent committee. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153240	Thank you. There are a number of brief comments. It's first, sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153244	Thank you for that, and thank you for the bill. I just want to know if the Minister can guarantee that we are now going completely to the edge of these so-called international agreements. I read from the answers to question 1, in which the Minister says about the children if the nationality of the parents is fraudulently obtained:... if the child has acquired the right of birth through him or her, unless this would be contrary to Denmark's international obligations and unless the child thereby becomes stateless. This is the last wording I have my doubts about. In other words, are the two links parallel, so that it is both a question of being stateless and international obligations, so that we have not gone quite to where the international obligations limit it? Is there a margin where we can tighten up further or, in the view of the Minister, has there been as much tightening as possible?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153342	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153343	Thank you for the question. The short answer is that there is a margin. It would be possible to deny children statelessness within the framework of international obligations, and it is with open eyes that we on the part of the government are going into it, because precisely here we do not want to go to the edge of the international conventions because we think it would be inappropriate. It could, for example, be done. be a foreign national who goes to Denmark, becomes a Danish citizen and resolves himself from his former citizenship, and then the child is also released from his former citizenship. If it turns out that the danger has been given Danish citizenship by fraud, I think it is fair enough to say: then it is your own problem that you have become stateless; the Danish state cannot stand by that. But I don't think we can tell the child to be stateless. If parents have not resolved from their previous citizenship, the child will still be Brazilians or Koreans, and then I think it is unproblematic to say that the child has not become Dane, for then the child is still away protected. You know, citizenship is a protection.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153448	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153449	That's what I was afraid of. Is it not a rather wrong signal to send if this government wants to show that it is going to go to the edge of the international conventions? It is, of course, very, very few who lose their citizenship as a result of fraud, and it is probably even fewer children who would be in this situation. Would it not be better to say that the same consequence is set for the children, who have the right of birth derived from the parents, in view of the fact that these are so few cases we are talking about? It can be said that the child can apply for birth rights independently at a later date.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153529	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153530	I think this is the first time I have seen in Parliament that the Danish People's Party says that we should just let the conventions dictate Danish legislation and not think for ourselves. So I think that politically we cannot say that a child who has been freed from his own citizenship as a result of the parents' decision and who will then lose his Danish citizenship as a result of the parents' fraud must suddenly stand stateless. I don't think that would be fair to that child. That would not be appropriate either, for the child will grow up and only be stateless. But where Mr. Morten Messerschmidt may have a point, is that one can discuss how many this will include in the real world, because the courts will also have to decide whether to deny the child the citizenship of the parents' frauds even if we had gone all the way to the edge of the conventions. There you would have to take into account the best interests of the child and many other things. So the question is how much substance is really in it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153623	Then it's mr. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153625	Thank you, Minister. This is a really fine bill, but the reality is that it would be far better if criminals didn't get citizenship at all in the first place so we shouldn't have a fight to take it away from them afterwards. And give the figures that have emerged from my questions to the Minister, among other things. 45%. So, will the Minister sit down with us and say that now we are tightening up the rules for permanent stay because there are also some terrible figures that show how many people commit crime there and we are also tightening up on this category of young people aged 18-23 who commit super-high crime after they have acquired citizenship?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153708	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153709	The first thing I want to say is that we should bear in mind that the figures that I have sent to the Danish Parliament and which are being referred to here are, of course, from a time when the rules for obtaining citizenship looked different than they do today. They have been tightened, even more than once, in fact perhaps more than three times, I think, since the persons mentioned in that reply have been granted citizenship. The next thing I want to say is that these figures represent crimes, i.e. offences committed, apart from some minor traffic offences. But it ranges from something very serious to something less serious. And what we are discussing with this bill is really, really serious crime, which is detrimental to the vital interests of the state. That someone who, at the age of 18, has acquired citizenship and maybe later in life gets a traffic ticket of DKK 3,500 does not seem to me to be quite comparable to what we are discussing with this bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153819	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153820	However, the figures show that there are some, fortunately, few, but very, very hard groups who have been expelled from Somalia, Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, in particular, who repeatedly commit serious crime. This appears in the permanent residence statistics, and it appears in the statistics on citizenship. And just because we have tightened the citizenship rules a little, we haven't solved this problem. So when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration sees these numbers and knows that there are loopholes, among other things. For 18-19-year-olds who can only have permanent residence without meeting very many requirements, does the Minister not want to do something about it? Wouldn't the Minister like to meet with us and try to solve these problems?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153902	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153903	To this I would say that since these people have been granted citizenship, the Folketing has at least three times tightened the rules, and the last time it was, of course, with the main focus on the requirement of good repute, i.e. the extent to which crime must have been committed in order to acquire citizenship. So the Folketing has
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153936	Then it's mr. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302153938	Thank you. As I said in my speech, we in the SF are open to depriving adults of their citizenship if they seriously harm Denmark's vital interests and do not make them stateless or violate any international conventions. But this proposal, as the Minister said just now, is also about some children who have no blame for this. Does the Minister not think that the removal of Danish citizenship as a consequence of the actions of their parents could have quite serious consequences for innocent children?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154013	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154015	First of all, I would like to say that no, because this is about people who do not become stateless. The United States, China and India, for example, are: some of the countries from which we get a great many applications for citizenship. If they maintain, let us say their American citizenship, and if the danger is denied Danish citizenship because he has acquired Danish citizenship by fraud, then the child is only an American citizen. I do not think that is very problematic. It must also be said that this is something that happens by judgment, so in any case the courts must make an individual assessment of whether it will be proportionate also to say to the child that, because it has happened by fraud, it must be deprived of it. There's something to do with how long you've been here. If a child has been here for 14 days, I think a court will say it is no problem. If it's 14 years old, then suddenly it starts to be something completely different. That is why I am reasonably confident that the courts will now come up with that assessment. I also heard what the SF said on the platform, and I would very much like to have SF's mandates behind this bill. So perhaps it could be an idea that I tried in writing to elaborate on how this specific and individual assessment will be carried out and on what it will be based.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154130	Sir. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154131	We are happy to elaborate on this in writing, but briefly I can say that the children have to be taken out of this. So there should be no children who experience having their citizenship deprived as a consequence of the actions of their parents. I am pleased with the clear answer given by the Minister that it does not seem to be problematic. I have to say that the Socialist People's Party is somewhere else. We think it is a very violent thing to deprive children of their citizenship, because they may be in a situation where they have arranged their whole lives after they actually expected to continue to have it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154203	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154204	I would like to start by saying that even if you are deprived of your citizenship, you may well fall back on a residence permit. So it doesn't mean that you have to leave Denmark. But I'd like to challenge a little, just make a little bit of curiosity with the Socialist People's Party. If a German citizen goes to Denmark and seeks Danish citizenship, but lets another take the citizenship test, and if the authorities find out that it is the wrong person who has taken the test, and then you deny the nationality of the father because of fraud, let us say after 3 months, is it a problem to tell the father that your child is not a Danish citizen either, because the child was given it as a result of your citizenship? I don't think that's a problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154245	Then it's Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154247	I would very much like to hear from the Minister whether, firstly, the Minister has considered whether this bill restricts the jurisdiction of the courts and, secondly, whether consideration has been given to whether the legislative proposal has a real content.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154308	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154310	To the end, the answer is yes. It is true that not many people are denied their citizenship by judgment; unfortunately, I do not have the exact figure, but that happens. And it is also true that few have had it removed administratively; it is 12, so it happens. I don't think this is going to be many either, but there's substance to the bill or we wouldn't be putting it forward. To the first, which was asked whether the importance of the courts should be reduced: well, if the legislators, i.e. the Parliamentary Chamber, say that there should not be a withdrawal, but that it should be taken away, then it is the legislators who are sending a signal to the courts that the scope for action before the courts is somewhat restricted. But I think it is perfectly legitimate for the legislative power to have that wish.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154405	Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154407	It can be said in this way that the Minister believes that there is real content, at least in relation to the fact that those covered by the bill are not zero. However, it was probably more a consideration of whether there is any substance whatsoever in changing from one person to another, because the courts actually acknowledge what is in the pleas submitted. So that way I think the question was meant. Perhaps there is real content. But if there is a real content, I would certainly like to hear the Minister what he thinks: if there is a real content, is there not a restriction? And I could understand that from the Minister that he doesn't think that's a problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154500	Then it's the minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154502	No, I don't think that's a problem. As I said before, I think it is perfectly legitimate for the legislative power in the paragraphs and in the law to try to describe what is the political intention. And here there is a desire to stress that citizenship must be withdrawn if a criminal act has been carried out which endangers the vital interests of the state. I think the questioner is right that it will often be brought on the table in advance by the prosecution, which will raise it as a demand; so it will nevertheless be dealt with in the courts often. However, we are now stressing on the part of the legislative authority, if there is a majority in favour of it, that this should happen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154546	Then it's Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154547	Thank you so much. I just wanted to hear the Minister why the Minister would think that it would be a problem for Denmark to withdraw from the National Convention. Because it is the one who stands in the way of taking citizenship far more away from those who do not deserve it so much.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154611	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154613	In general terms, we in the government are in favour of international binding agreements between nation states, and that is the basis for how both international cooperation works, but also for how we bind ourselves to the mast under certain conditions. This does not mean that we agree with all the rules contained in the international conventions, but it means that the principle that different nation states bind each other to some basic principles is a good way of maintaining the values of civilisation and the progress of democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154657	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154700	That was not such a super concrete reply from the Minister. Well, it basically means that you put these old conventions above protecting Denmark, and I just don't really understand that. Because, as the Minister himself says in his speech and as it actually says in parts of this bill, one does not want to take citizenship away from those who do not deserve the gift, that is to get Danish citizenship. Well, we would also like them to be deported. But this convention is getting in the way. So what is it that stands in the way of simply derogating from this, so simply removing this convention? And what benefit does Denmark have from it at all?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154744	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154745	First of all, I do not think we should break the rules that have been agreed, so what must be the discussion is whether we should terminate them, in other words remove Denmark's agreement to them. And it is probably just my view that on the bottom line Denmark has an interest in common ground rules on some basic principles. And now we are discussing foreign policy today, but it can also be about much else. One can of course take the other view that we should be a country that did not have such strong international cooperation and had to fly a little more freely. But I just don't think it's in Denmark and the Danes' interest, so it's a little more fundamental discussion about how Denmark's role in the international world should be. And we are just in the role of being committed, joining things and supporting other countries joining things. Too few countries have signed up to the conventions. There aren't too many countries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154842	Thank you. Then there are no further brief comments, so we thank the Minister. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Bodily Rights. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154911	The debate is open, and we shall first give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302154920	In the motion for a resolution, Radical Ventre proposes to reintroduce the previous rule into the law of citizenship, so that young foreigners born and raised in Denmark again have easy access to Danish citizenship. The proposal will go back to the previous legal situation in which young foreigners born in Denmark could become a Danish citizen simply by making a statement. It is less than a year ago that we last stood in the Chamber and dealt with a similar proposal, and the government cannot support the motion for a resolution at this time either. I would like to reiterate that, in the view of the government, the previous access to the declaration was too lenient. There were, for example: no training or character requirements have been imposed for persons aged between 18 and 19. The motion for a resolution states that PET must assess whether young foreigners may be a threat to the security of the state. However, I would like to reiterate that Paragraph 44 of the Constitution contains a delegation ban which means that it cannot be left to the administrative authority to decide on the granting of citizenship. Paragraph 44 of the Basic Law does not prevent the adoption of legislation which allows a person to obtain Danish nationality by declaration, but that some objective verifiable conditions are fulfilled and that no discretion is left to the authority responsible for deciding whether the conditions are met. However, in applying for citizenship by naturalisation, PET makes an assessment of whether the applicant may be a threat to the security of the State. Such an assessment will not be based solely on objective, verifiable facts. Therefore, in the context of a declaration access, it will not be possible to require PET to have considered that the young person who wishes to declare himself Danish is not a threat to the security of the state, as proposed. It is the government's view that it is reasonable that Danish citizenship can be applied for on the basis of pre-established criteria that support requirements for language, social understanding, democracy, crime, self-reliance and loyalty. The rules on the granting of citizenship are based on a broad political agreement, and I am pleased that the government, together with the Left, Conservatives and LA last year, agreed on a new agreement. Part of it is that the rules on the granting of citizenship also apply to this group of young people. It is also the view of the government, as I mentioned last time, that PET for that group should assess whether they could endanger the security of the state, just as it is the government's view that young people should have a permanent residence permit. The current rules already take account to a certain extent of young people born and raised in Denmark. Today, if you have completed the 9th or 10th grade of primary school with a total average score of 2 in Danish or a passed baccalaureate, then you meet the language requirement. Fortunately, most young people who were born and raised in Denmark have. In addition, there is a relaxed residence requirement for people who have entered Denmark before the age of 15, including those who were born here. The rules on citizenship form an important pillar of Danish immigration policy and I think we have found a very good balance in the existing rules. We are therefore not prepared to support the existing proposal either. As I have mentioned earlier, I personally would not regard it as either dismissive or discriminatory if I lived in another country and my child, who was born in that country, had to meet certain requirements in order to obtain the nationality of that country. That is why I think it is right that we should make demands on young people who have been born and raised in Denmark and who want to have Danish citizenship, but who do not have parents who have it before they were 18, so that they could have it with their parents. The government cannot therefore support the motion for a resolution. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155251	Thank you. There are a few brief comments and the first is from Mrs Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155255	Again as last year, I can say that it is not as such a relaxation that there is a short residence requirement when it is the case that you have actually been in Denmark throughout your life. Then it doesn't help much that the residence requirement gets shortened. But I would certainly like to hear from the Minister about it, because many of the young people I have talked to say that they have felt Danish, but that at the moment when they discover that they do not have Danish citizenship, they feel alienated, and on top of that chock, it is also a huge sense of defeat. And then it has a triple effect, because the young people will then have to juggle both exams, leisure jobs and studies, while at a very, very small standard of living they will typically have to find the means to pay for both permanent stay and possibly citizenship. Does the Minister have a position that it might be cheaper for young people?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155415	Then it's the minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155417	First of all, I am pleased that the young people who have written to Mrs Susan Kronborg feel like Danish, because then there is a great deal of success. Secondly, it is so little too bad that their parents have been parents to them • some children who feel Danish for 18 years, without the parents having applied for citizenship themselves, because if they had applied for and acquired citizenship, they could thus bring the children as bi-participants and make sure that their children, who feel Danish, then also formally become Danish citizens. The fees for applying for different rights in the field of aliens are permanent residence, and this is the case with citizenship. In some way, this is a response to the fact that these applications require a lot of processing and that there is also a political desire on the part of the government to have it carried out not uniquely by tax dollars, but that people help to pay for it themselves. In general terms, it is not quite unusual in the public administration to pay some money to have different documents issued or to have access to different services.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155533	Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155534	With the level of expenditure we are talking about, it would not mean anything to the Minister or to me for that matter or for the average adult person here in Denmark, but for young people, it could be half of the budget that suddenly smokes and there is no money for books and there is no money for a winter coat. Does the Minister have any view that we, as politicians in the Committee on the Rights of the Child, refuse and that we do not give any justification for this in the case of derogation applications?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155611	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155612	I understand that several thousand crowns are not just a grip in the pocket for young people of 18 or 19 years of age; I fully agree with that. And I myself believe that there is a limit. There is, on the one hand, a convention limit on how expensive it can be, but I also think that politically there is a limit on how expensive it should be. On the other hand, it must also be said that there is probably some reason why, if you are seeking citizenship in another country, they are taking some money for it. I can't imagine Denmark being the only country that does that. Then I forgot the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155644	Then it's mr. Peder Hvelplund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155649	Thank you. I would just like to start by reading what the then Minister of Justice Karen Hækkerup said back in 2014 when the then SR government put forward a bill which was about securing declaration access and which, of course, came to seem quite short, from 2015 and a few months forward until it was abolished by the new Left-led government. However, in this context, former Minister of Justice Karen Hækkerup said in connection with the submission: "The young foreigners who have been born and raised in Denmark and who have taken part in Danish society now have the opportunity to declare themselves Danish. The government believes that this group of well-integrated young people should have easier access to citizenship in Denmark. It facilitates integration. Is it not the view of the current minister that we should promote integration in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155737	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155740	I very much agree that we must promote integration. I think perhaps the basic political discussion here is whether we allocate citizenship to promote integration or whether we allocate citizenship to people we consider to be integrated. So, is it a carrot to reach the goal, or is it a reward for achieving the goal? I am probably most in favour of citizenship being something one gets once one has reached the goal, and we believe that thousands of people are every year. After all, we are distributing a lot of citizenship in this country, but not as an incentive to integrate. And it is, of course, such a fundamental political discussion that we in the Folketing have had with each other for a number of years now. Then we can always discuss the criteria and how tight the requirements should be. But what is the position of the government is that citizenship is something one gets when one has been integrated and, as Susan Kronborg's contacts say, feels like Danes, and that it is not an appeal for: Please feel like Danish? And: What if we give you a passport, don't you feel a little more Danish? It should be the end of the process.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155851	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155853	I have to understand that quite correctly, because I actually thought that the task was to increase integration, in other words to ensure that the people who are here permanently and legally in the country are also integrated into society. If citizenship is also a tool for achieving it, is that the objective? I guess that's increasing integration. It is certainly not a question of the citizens who acquire citizenship, but of the fact that citizenship is also an indication that you are a full member of the society in which you are legally resident.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155922	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302155923	I agree with the latter. It is a document and a right that you get because you are what I am just reacting to is that we use citizenship as a carrot for people to be integrated, in other words as a kind of incentive to become more Danish. And when I have been following the debate on citizenship for a few years, I can only see that there are voices in the debate saying: let us give people a passport, because then they will probably be more happy to live here and then they will probably be more integrated. But I think that's the reverse way of doing it. You gotta start by asking people to be part of this society, and if they're looking for a permanent stay, it's gotta be because this is where they're going to live. When they have had a permanent stay for a few years, and if they feel like Danish and they feel that this is where their home country is located, that is the country they want to live in and defend and feel like part of and influence on the country, then you can get citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160021	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. That brings us to the general debate. The first is sir. Lars Aslan Rasmussen from the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160041	Thank you. With this motion for a resolution, the Radical Left proposes to reinstate the former section 3A of the law on citizenship, so that young foreigners born and raised in Denmark will again have easy access to Danish citizenship. In the Social Democratic Party, of course, we believe that high demands must be made on people who wish to become Danish citizens. That is right and proper, because, with a welfare state like ours, it requires a strong community within the population. With immigration from the so-called MENAP countries, our population composition has changed over time. People have come here who differ in terms of value from the rest of the population. It is no longer certain that young people with immigrant backgrounds born and raised in Denmark consider themselves to be part of our community. In other words, one does not necessarily become Danish by being born and raised in Denmark. There are several examples of this. Many of those who chose to go to Syria to fight for the Islamic State were born and raised in Denmark. One of the cases recently raised by the Radical Left, which they used in their campaign for how unfair it was, was a woman named Kübra Sahan. If you went into her facebook profile, you could see that she was a great supporter of Turkey's President Erdogan. It is not necessarily something that is compatible with Danish values. That is why we must, of course, make high demands on foreigners who wish to become Danish citizens. This also applies to foreigners born and raised in Denmark. For Danish citizens must of course be Danish-minded. As the rules are today, young people with immigrant backgrounds who were born and raised in Denmark and who apply for Danish citizenship before the age of 22 have the possibility of obtaining a derogation. Their cases are referred to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which is responsible for deciding whether or not to grant derogations for employment claims. In other words, there is already an opportunity for foreigners to obtain Danish citizenship under relaxed conditions. Social democracy does not support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160226	Thank you. There is a brief comment on Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160229	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur. What is the rapporteur's view of the fact that decisions are taken by politicians on the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in which there is no justification and where it is not possible to be heard by the parties, so that it can be difficult to understand at all why a refusal has been made and there is no possibility of administrative complaints? What does the rapporteur think about this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160304	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160305	I think it's very democratic that it's the Folketing in here who decides who's gonna have citizenship... some of the allerallerfinest. If you want everyone to have citizenship, you have to vote on the Radical Left. If you think that virtually no one should have it, you can vote for New Citizens. If you want someone who actually reads the cases and takes a stand on a case-by-case basis, you can vote on, for example. Social democracy. Personally, I always tell people if I don't want to take up their case and why I don't want it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160328	Here you go. The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160330	Thank you. What does the rapporteur think about the fact that, in our accession to the Convention on Civil Liberties, there has been a reservation on administrative redress, but there has in fact been no reservation on the explanatory statement? What is the rapporteur's view of the fact that we do not actually follow the Convention on Civil Liberties in this area and do not provide a justification?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160356	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160357	I think you get a very fair treatment. If you are in a situation where you want to get your case up, you can contact a committee member. I know there's more and I can tell you what I'm doing myself that's taken up some of these cases, and I think you're actually getting a fair treatment. I think there are very clear rights. I would also say that when you are born and raised in Denmark and your parents have not chosen to be Danish citizens themselves, I think it is fair enough that this is something you ask for and want for yourself.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160424	The next brief remark is to Mr. Peder Hvelplund from Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160427	Thank you. I think that this is an interesting idea that the rapporteur takes in relation to citizenship and that one should be Danish, even when one is born and raised in Denmark • so that, although one is born and raised in Denmark, one does not necessarily have Danish values. So I would just like to ask the rapporteur whether this is the kind of thinking the rapporteur intends to pursue in other areas. It could be for my children; now they happen to have parents who both have Danish citizenship, but the rapporteur has no guarantee that they have what the rapporteur defines as Danish values. Should their citizens also be called into question, and should they be able to lose the right to vote for a parliamentary election? Or is this something that only applies to certain types of citizens?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160513	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160514	I think it's a problem and that's probably what separates the Social Democratic Party from Enhedslisten... that there's a lot of people in this society who don't share basic Danish values. Now I mentioned before that the Radical Left used a case that toured all the media and which turned out to be a sworn supporter of President Erdogan. I don't think that's very Danish. But in the Radical Left, perhaps also in the Enhedslisten, I do not know. But basically I think that yes, it is a problem, and we can see when we look at studies of what some immigrants' attitudes are to homosexuals and to the liberation of women, then they are significantly different from those of ethnic Danes. Therefore, it is fair enough that you come up for a test if you want to become a Danish citizen. And again: As with the Radical Left, the policy of Enhedslisten is basically that everyone must have Danish citizenship, including people who have committed very serious crimes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160556	Here you go. The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160558	After all, the question is whether supporting Erdogan is enough to prevent one from being a Danish citizen and not voting for a Danish parliamentary election. I would strongly disagree politically with someone who supports Erdogan, just as there are people with whom I strongly disagree politically with Danish citizens. But is it a criterion for being Danish and being able to vote for a parliamentary election that some political criteria are being laid down on what political considerations are being and are being considered? Is that a line of thought which the rapporteur wishes to pursue?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160633	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160634	I find it difficult to see how one can be Danish and support a president who is even a dictator in another country. I find that very difficult, and the Radical Left was brought to the attention of this time. I simply cannot see that it has anything to do with being Danish. I think that is actually a problem. If there were a million people who had that attitude, we would not have the society we have today in Denmark. I think it is fair enough that you go up to a test and show that you can when it is an active choice. It may also be that your parents have chosen to be Turkish citizens and want to stick to that decision, and then you can either be there or go to a test yourself. I think the rules are quite transparent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160708	The next question is Mr. Sikandar Siddique. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160710	Thank you for the floor, President, and thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. A little further to the debate we have here, I would like to hear the opinion of the Social Democratic Party that one in ten children born in Denmark are born without a Danish passport. Right now we have 440,000 people who have lived here for at least four years and who do not have Danish passports. What might concern us in the Free Greens is that if that development continues, we will end up with a very large number of citizens who have been born here, who work here and so on, but are not part of democracy, so that we do not have the right to vote. It is really an open question: what does social democracy think about that development? It's related to this, why we want to make it easier to get Danish citizenship. If this group gets bigger and bigger, isn't that a problem with our cohesion in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160812	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160813	Yes, and welcome to the debate I do not know if Mr. Sikandar Siddique heard my speech. Well, I think it is a problem if there are too many people in our society who do not have Danish citizenship, and that is why it is also related to what policy one wants to have for how many people are going into this country. These two things are connected, and that is why we have a slightly different policy on foreigners than some of those on the left. For it is clear that if a million people from the Middle East were invited in, it would be a problem because many of them would probably not meet the criteria for obtaining Danish citizenship. But as it is now, I think it is fine, and I hope that a great many will seek. I'd still think that if you were born and raised in Denmark, if you're reasonably integrated, you could pass this test.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160853	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160854	I am certainly pleased that the rapporteur indicates that it is problematic if there are too many people outside society, even if they are part of society. The problem is that now you have made this new birthright law, which in practice means that if you are born here without a Danish citizenship and want to have a long-term education, you can in principle only be considered when you are 28 or 29 years old. So it is a long time to live a society, grow up in a society and then not be able to participate in democracy and be a sort of spectator of democracy. That is why I really want to repeat the question: if that development continues, it goes without saying that the group will be huge, huge, and is it not a problem for our cohesion?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160937	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302160938	That is also what I said: if there were a million people from the Middle East. But I don't want a society like that. That's way too many. I do not think that many Danish society can capture, because then there would be a lot that did not have citizenship. I'd like to arrest that thing about a good life. I think you can have a good life in Denmark without necessarily having citizenship. After all, there are people who have fled Iran, who, in fact, have both Iranian citizenship and Danish citizenship, strangely enough, but some hold on to that. So I mean, you can live a good life for that reason. And there are some softer requirements in applying for Danish citizenship if you are born and raised here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161009	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Morten Dahlin from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161021	Thank you, President. This is not the first time we have had this discussion in the Parliamentary Chamber about reintroducing the former section 3A of the law of citizenship. We discussed it when the Social Democracy sat in government and thought it was an excellent idea. Then we discussed it when the Left came into government and thought it was such a bad idea that we removed it. Then we discussed it in 2017 when the SF tabled a similar motion for a resolution and we discussed it in 2019 when the Radical Left tabled a similar motion for a resolution. And then we discussed the last year when the Radical Left put forward an identical proposal for what they have put forward and we are discussing here today. There can therefore be no doubt that the now former section 3A of the law of citizenship is quite well debated here in the Assembly Hall. That is why it will not be a great surprise that the Left is also against the proposal this time. We have not changed our position, because we think it is basically quite fair that we make a number of demands on those who want to be part of the Danish community. Danish citizenship is something unique; it is something special. And therefore it is right and proper that we make demands on foreigners who wish to become Danish citizens, even if they were born on Danish soil. Having said that, it is important to remember that in a number of areas there are actually more relaxed requirements for the group of foreigners born and raised in Denmark. That is why it will not come as a surprise when I say that, like the other times, we in the Left cannot support the resolution. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161217	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There is a brief comment from Mrs Susan Kronborg, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161221	Thank you very much, and thank you to the rapporteur. Indeed, as the rapporteur mentions, there is also the possibility of obtaining a derogation from the Committee on the Rights of the Child. There I would like to hear what the position of the Left is that we know that, according to them, the rapporteur of the DF and the rapporteur of the New Citizens' Party are actually voting against anyone who is Muslim or comes from Muslim countries. What is the Left's position on this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161251	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161252	First of all, I do not know where the rapporteur heard that I mentioned something about a derogation in the Committee on Bodily Rights. Actually, I didn't say anything about that in my speech. I said, if there is already for this group what other parties are voting on the Committee on Bodily Rights, they must, but we are not voting on what religion people have. In other words, we are voting on each individual case that we are reading, which we are getting involved in. Some exemption applications we vote yes to, others we vote no to. It's the Left's way of doing things. And, of course, I believe that the way in which the Left does things is the right thing to do. I would urge all parties to follow this; unfortunately, I am not sure that everyone else feels the same as me.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161341	Thank you. Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161343	Now I think that the Left made a lot of sense of telling us that this proposal has been up a number of times, and that is quite true. And I would like to take this opportunity to say that this is, in fact, a thinking that we have had for 200 years, actually since 1776. But in addition, I would like to ask a question. I have a very good friend named Ilknur, and she has been through the mill fighting for citizenship. Among other things: she has been awarded the Left Freedom Prize because she has been a guiding star and engaged in volunteering and has meant so much to so many young people. I would like to know whether the Left has an opinion that a girl like Ilknur has been through a hedge race of obstacles to Danish citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161439	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161440	First of all, I have to admit that I didn't quite understand what kind of thinking it was, who had had about what since the 1700s. I'm sorry, but I just missed it. Then there is the question of a specific case which, of course, I cannot relate to. I can only say that if you are a well-integrated citizen of Denmark who behaves properly, who has taken on the Danish values that support himself and who makes an effort in voluntary association life, then the demands we have made to become a Danish citizen are not impossible to meet. That is why it is quite fair to have to meet those requirements.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161512	Thanks to the rapporteur of the Left, there are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Carl Valentin of the Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161522	Thank you for the floor. And thank you to the Radical Left for the proposal here too. The Socialist People's Party supports that young people born and raised in Denmark should have access to citizenship by declaration. For how can one explain the following to a young person or to a child: You may have been born and raised in Denmark just like all of us, yes, but you are not a Dane on the same terms as the rest of us? I simply cannot see the logic or the fairness of it. There is something special about getting a Danish citizenship and becoming part of the community on an equal footing with all other Danes. It is a privilege and demands must be made on those who come from outside and want to achieve it. But when it comes to young people who have been born and raised in this country, young people who have Danish friends, have gone to a Danish kindergarten and a Danish school and may not even know anything else, then it is only fair that they get Danish citizenship. As far as I am concerned, one of the positive aspects of the proposal is that young people can feel that they are really Danish from the start, but also have the responsibility to do so. Well, they're gonna be able to tell themselves they're gonna be Danes and this is their country. Let me therefore also call on the government and other parties in here to take a very critical view of the proposal here. If we are concerned about combating parallel societies and ensuring that people born in this country become citizens and not opposers, then it is a good idea to support this proposal here. In this way, we can ensure that people do not grow up in an identity vacuum, but gain an understanding of ownership in relation to the country and a sense that it is something we have together and must be careful. We need to strengthen the cohesion by meeting some young people who have had their whole lives and upbringing in Denmark. It is in many cases young people who have had all their schooling in Denmark and who have their friends and family in Denmark and who may not even know anything else. They are entitled to some basic rights and should also be entitled to be described by the state as what they are Danish. That is why the Socialist People's Party supports the proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161753	The first brief remark is to Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161757	Thank you very much to the rapporteur and thank you for your support. I would really like to hear what SF thinks about this process, which is relatively expensive, and sometimes it can be really difficult for young people to have room for the cost in a regular budget. It may be that you have to choose from 825 kroner. for a birth test and winter boots. It may be the choice between spending 4,000 kroner. at an application fee or you have to buy books for the studio. What's SF thinking about that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161836	Here you go, rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161837	I think that process is unnecessarily problematic for people who have been born and raised here. That's how short I think it can be said.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161851	Is there a follow-up question? No. The next brief remark goes to Mr Beyer de Ryke. Morten Dahlin from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161852	Thank you. I really have two questions for the SF rapporteur. The first is about the tone of SF in relation to the young people who have either come to Denmark early or who have been born here. SF makes it sound as if there is no easier access for these people today, as if they should seek citizenship completely on equal terms with everyone else. Would the SF's rapporteur kindly confirm from Parliament's Chair that this is not the case, of course? There's actually a lot easier access for these people. That's one. The second is that the SF's rapporteur mentions that these people are entitled to Danish citizenship. So if you are born and raised in Denmark, you are entitled to Danish citizenship according to SF. Actually, I'd just like to ask sir. Carl Valentin, whether it was a statement or whether it really is SF's policy that if you were born on Danish soil, you are entitled to Danish citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161951	Thank you, and here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302161952	The first question was of a factual nature, and it is true that the requirements are more relaxed for people who have been born and raised here. That's nice, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we think it's good enough. We think that it should be possible to obtain citizenship by declaration and that it is perfectly natural that you should have Danish citizenship if you were born and raised here, as I emphasised in my speech. Yes, we think it should be a requirement, but there are also some exceptions in the old paragraph that the Radical Left wants to reinstate, and it is, for example, if PET has a remark on you that you can be detrimental to the interests of the state, and there are some other things. But yes, as a starting point we believe that if you are born and raised here, you should be able to obtain Danish citizenship, and that can be described as having a right to it, as I see it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162042	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162043	After all, this is an exciting discussion in which the whole perspective of what citizenship is is really being debated now in the Parliamentary Chamber. It's pretty exciting. And the SF, I understand, is in favour of the American model, where what determines whether you should be a citizen is solely whether you were born in the country. I would therefore like to ask the SF's rapporteur, who has now confirmed that it is the party's policy that if you were born in Denmark, you are entitled to Danish citizenship: How long should you have stayed in Denmark to obtain Danish citizenship if you were born on Danish soil?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162116	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162118	I said born and raised in Denmark, and therefore it also matters how long you have been on Danish soil during the period that has passed. Of course.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162128	The next question is Mr. Morten Messerschmidt from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162131	Thank you, President. I note that in his speech the rapporteur used the word'recitizen', that is to say the words 'citizen' and'recitizen', and in this connection I would like to hear what the Socialist People's Party is thinking about the contributions that have been made in relation to this anti-citizenship by granting for decades the right of citizenship to some people who have obviously shown themselves to be inappropriate and who are, of course, the reason why we are now making a great deal of tightening. In other words, it is of course the Left and the Radical Left, which may in fact be the main opponent, but let it be a headless approach to citizenship and the way in which the Left has acted, which means that today you have to tighten in such a way that some people who are perhaps not meant to be affected by the austerity are still. So what do you think, sir? Carl Valentin and his group are discussing their responsibilities in this regard?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162224	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162226	I have had many thoughts about the responsibility of the left in relation to the integration task in Denmark. But I must also say frankly that I grew up in a SF where I think integration problems have been taken relatively seriously. Well, I remember that the year when I joined the Socialist People's Party was about the same year when Villy Søvndal, our then president, was out to say that Hizb ut-Tahrir could... Yes, I can't quote it here, because it's too hard words to say from the parliamentary platform, but they could at least get out of the country. And he said that because it was important for him too to take a stand on an approach that, for example, does not take religious extremism seriously, and I think that this showdown was important to take. But I also find it a little strange to stand here so many years after joining the Socialist People's Party in 2007 which at that time, I think, has also taken the integration task seriously, and should then just as well apologize on behalf of the left for the approach one has had at a time when I was not in Danish politics at all. I don't really feel that's my job.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162328	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162329	Well, it wasn't necessarily an excuse I asked for; it was kind of more of a reflection. And I'm glad to hear that Mr. Carl Valentin mentions one of the few areas where I am so sorry that Mr. Villy Søvndal hasn't got his policy through. Well, I know Hizb ut-Tahrir is still away on this side of the earth's surface and not down in hell. What are the views of the Socialist People's Party that the many people you care about and where they say that it is unfair that they are being affected if that is the expression that needs to be used to impose restrictions on the area of citizenship in the light of the fact that it is the laissez-faire mentality of the left that is the cause of the restrictions?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162407	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162408	I think it clearly has an impact on how strict a policy one wants to pursue now that it has been too relaxed in the past. Well, I agree with Mr. Knox. Morten Messerschmidt i. The fact that the legislation is so strict is not simply, at least not in my optics, a consequence of the fact that it has been too lenient in the past. It is also because there are some parties in the Folketing who are willing to go extremely far, as I see it. And the SF was not included in the most recent agreement on citizenship, precisely because we think that we are going too far on some points. So I think it is a combination of a somewhat lenient policy in the past and then, of course, a very strong will to tighten really hard on the part of some parties in here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162444	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mr. Marcus Knuth of the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162447	Thank you. I was not really going to ask a question, because I think it is quite obvious that we are opposed to this proposal. But I hear the rapporteur from the SF say in all seriousness that if you are born and raised in Denmark, you have to be entitled to Danish citizenship. It's just straight, so I get it. I mean, are there no limits to crime? You may have committed violence, rape, been a gang member, and is it completely free? Can you have committed as much crime as you want, and then you get it anyway, just because you were born and raised in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162515	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162516	No, because what you want to introduce here with the proposal is the old paragraph, which also took account of some of these things. And there may be some special warnings that mean that you do not get Danish citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162528	Here you go. The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162530	But can the rapporteur not just, for all of us, clarify where the limit is? Is it rape, is it 1 year in prison, is it a suspended sentence?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162538	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162539	It is relatively complicated to interpret here exactly where the limit goes in relation to these things, but I think it should be the starting point that when you are born and raised here, you also have to have Danish citizenship. That's for sure.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162552	We thank the SF rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Dolphin from the Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302162602	Thank you for that, President. That young people born and raised in Denmark can obtain Danish citizenship by declaration is an old and well-tested rule. That was all that was missing, because of course young people are Danish when they have had their whole lives in this country. They must have the right to a red-bellied passport and the right to vote enjoyed by the rest of us. The declaration access system was introduced back in the 1950s and applied until 2004 when the VK government, which sat on the votes of the Danish People's Party, abolished the scheme for all non-Nordic citizens. When the SRSF government arrived in 2011, it was written into the government base that the declaration access should be reinstated. The flower had apparently not grown in the garden of the Social Democratic Party, so the Social Democratic Justice Ministers took their time to establish the scheme. It did not come until 2014, but due to difficulties with the candidate's solution from a previous nationality, the scheme did not work until 2015. That is why it only came to work fully for a few months before the Left Government, as one of the first, took the initiative to abolish the system, moreover with social democratic support. From 2016, young people born and raised Denmark have again had to go through the heavy, bureaucratic and expensive naturalisation process to obtain full civil rights in the country that is theirs. If we are to facilitate the acquisition of citizenship for young people, it is not just a political view of the Radical Left, the Enhedslisten, the Free Greens and the SF, but it is also something that Denmark has committed itself to in Article 6 of the European Convention on Civil Rights. After the Left Government has abolished the declaration access for young people who have been born and raised in Denmark, it is frankly difficult to see what Denmark is doing to fulfil that obligation, especially when looking at the last birthright agreement entered into by the government with the right wing. With that agreement, we are in fact in a situation where young people who have been born and raised here may never be able to obtain citizenship if they have made a mistake at the age of 15. In concrete terms, we are seeing situations where people who have been born and raised here, by parents who have been born and raised here, always have access to citizenship. We are therefore talking about keeping generations of citizens out of democracy. This isn't small stuff. We have gone from a situation where, 40 years ago, we had less than 2%. of the population without citizenship and thus the right to vote, to this day, when we are as high as around 15%. in Copenhagen and the surrounding area, which, without citizenship, cannot vote for elections and thus have democratic influence. It is therefore a serious democratic problem. One thing is that those who do not have influence are affected, but in fact the legitimacy of everything we decide in here is also removed when the majority consistently excludes a larger and larger proportion of the population from being able to have influence. In order to remedy this, the Folketing should adopt the motion for a resolution tabled by the Radical Left as soon as possible. I would like to end my speech with a quote. This stems from the press release issued by the then Social Democratic Minister of Justice, Karen Hækkerup, when she presented the SR Government's bill in March 2014 to reinstate the declaration access. And I quote: "The young foreigners who have been born and raised in Denmark and who have taken part in Danish society now have the opportunity to declare themselves Danish. The government believes that this group of well-integrated young people should be given easier access to citizenship. It promotes integration. I fully agree with the then Socialist Minister. I hope that it will once again be a policy of a social democratic government to promote integration in this important area. That is why the Enhedslisten can, of course, support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163007	Thank you. The first brief remark goes to Mrs Susan Kronborg, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163011	Thank you very much to the Enhedslisten for supporting the proposal. I would like to hear what the rapporteur thinks about the fact that much of Denmark's front staff during the past corona crisis are sosu assistants, nurses, kindergarten teachers, bus drivers and train drivers, just in the situation that they themselves come from abroad, but that their children are born here in Denmark, and that their children can still look forward to a procedure where they have to go through a hedge race of obstacles in order to obtain Danish citizenship. What is the position of Enhedslisten that it is then thanks that we cannot give them a declaration system that they have in other countries European countries? What does Enhedslisten think about that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163105	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163107	After all, this is a completely paradoxical situation when it comes to people who live in this country and have their daily activities here. As Mrs Susan Kronborg also notes, some of them have made a huge effort, including during the corona epidemic as front personnel. Whatever the case, it is paradoxical that people who have their daily activities in Denmark's children do not have the opportunity to obtain the full civil rights. That is, in fact, the democratic disaster in the situation we have today: that a greater and greater proportion of the population feel excluded, that is to say, separated, in Denmark and does not become part of society, even if they have their daily activities and their daily lives and have permanent and legal residence in the country. And that's why I think this is a perfectly natural way of ensuring that at least their children, like my children, have the opportunity to become Danish citizens, in that this is the country in which they were born and raised.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163212	Thank you. The next question is Mr. Lars Aslan Rasmussen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163216	Thank you to the rapporteur. It is a little strange that the rapporteur is so merry about what the Helle Thorning-Schmidt government thought 11 years ago. Well, right now, Enhedslisten changes his mind about Ukraine every 15 minutes. So I guess it's fair enough to get smarter in some areas. The rapporteur says that one might have made a small mistake. Isn't the truth that if an Arab boy has committed a rape at the age of 15, then, if it were for Enhedslisten, he must have a citizenship when he is 18 years old and has endured his punishment even if he wasn't born and raised in Denmark? So isn't the truth that these aren't just small mistakes? I hope that is not how it is seen in the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163252	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163253	We have a consistent position on the situation in Ukraine, as the rapporteur knows very well. In addition, however, I would welcome it if it were so that the Social Democratic Party could again change its position on this issue and have the same policy as it was under the previous Thorning Government. However, in relation to whether this is a small mistake, I would say that, as it is today, we see plenty of examples of citizens who have made a small mistake. It may be that you have participated in a bar fight, and we have seen examples of citizens who have done things for which they have never been convicted, but because they have had difficulty in documenting it, they have been very close to being excluded from having citizenship because of these rules. It is often citizens who have made a mistake, and then we can discuss whether it is a small mistake to have participated in a bar fight; that is, we have seen several examples of relatively small offences which have led to a conditional sentence • some of them without a punitive order • which then means that you are excluded from obtaining citizenship. And that does not mean that a rape is a small thing, but here we see examples of people who have made very few mistakes, where the consequence is that they never become citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163410	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163412	It is a good thing that the Enhedslisten's rapporteur thinks that the party's position on Ukraine is quite clear; let us take it at another time. Having said that, is it not correct to understand that when a person who was born and raised in Denmark or who has come to Denmark, because there are no limits to who should have citizenship, who has been raped or murdered, will Enhedslisten give him a citizenship at the age of 18? So these are not just minor errors; these are quite serious things for which Enhedslisten will nevertheless reward him with citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163442	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163444	No. In other words, it may well be a waiting period... that is also in the old section 3.. so you should not be charged with an offence at the time when you have to have access to a declaration. In the same way, as is the case today, there may be a carnage in connection with a crime committed. But the permanent exclusion or the fact that one has committed a crime at some point means that one can never become a citizen, I simply do not think it is fair. It is clear that if you commit an offence, you must be punished as Mr. Lars Aslan Rasmussen or I must be punished if we commit an offence but then the penalty ends, and that does not mean that we should never be able to obtain the right to citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163526	The next question is Mr. Morten Messerschmidt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163530	Thank you, President. The point I made was that sir... Peder Hvelplund quoted a socialist former minister, whom I did not catch the name of, but who should have said that citizenship was a good way of integrating. Perhaps it is good that I did not hear the name, because I cannot understand the context at all, and it could therefore be that Mr. Peder Hvelplund wanted to lead me into it a little bit. Well, sir. Peder Hvelplund, that all the unintegrated elements we have acquired into the country must have citizenship in order to become more Danish? - Sir... Peder Hvelplund say a little more about what kind of thinking is behind it? For me, it's the other way around. I think that we should give citizenship if people feel Danish rather than give them citizenship in the hope that they will move in that direction. And what kind of minister was that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163617	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163618	Let us get this straight with the minister first: it was former Minister of Justice Karen Hækkerup who was Minister of Justice in the SR government at the time. Those were her words I quoted. The reason why it is more conducive to integration is precisely that, when we do not allow citizenship, we have citizens who live in this country who have work, who have an education and who have their whole life here, but who do not gain the same rights and thus continue to feel like citizens who are not full members of society and who therefore have more difficulty in integrating themselves. For integration is therefore both ways. This means, of course, that we also make adjustments to those who come here and who meet the conditions and requirements that we make, and thus giving citizenship can actually promote integration, and I believe that there would be evidence of this too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163710	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163712	I really hope so, sir. Peder Hvelplund will be looking for. Well, to me, it sounds like such a bigger version of that horrible TV show where you get married without knowing each other in the hope that at some point you'll learn to love each other. And now I don't see it very much, but I don't have the impression that it goes that way very often. By the way, I would just like to say that it was good to have Mrs Karen Jespersen's odyssey brought forward. She's practically traveled from out there, where mr. Peder Hvelplund is still away and has ended up all over with me. I hope, sir. Peder Hvelplund one day will make the same trip.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163744	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163745	It is possible that I expressed myself unclearly. It was Mrs Karen Hækkerup • Hækkerup It was another political family, one has to say. Now I do not actually see the programme that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt mentioned, so that's why my knowledge about it is rather limited. But this is like never getting married, even if you want to. Even if it is two people who love each other who live together, who live together and who do it all their lives, sir. Morten Messerschmidt so say that even if you do, you don't have the right to marry, even if that's what they want? That's what this example corresponds to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163827	The next brief remark is from Mr. Marcus Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163830	I think that this comparison with "Married at first sight" is quite interesting, because the rapporteur makes it sound: Well, if you get Danish citizenship, you suddenly take Denmark in. After all, I have asked some questions, as Mr. Morten Messerschmidt also mentioned before where the answers on stateless persons, i.e. Often Palestinians, show that 45%. of the young Palestinians, who acquire Danish citizenship, commit crime subsequently. Mr. Peder Hvelplund, that's okay?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163900	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163901	I am not of the opinion that crime is in order. But the question is whether Mr. Marcus Knuth is of the opinion that if they had not acquired citizenship, they would also not have committed crime. That is basically the discussion we should have, because being able to provide citizenship does not exclude anyone from committing crime. It does not encourage anyone to do so either. But what I think one might well find evidence of is that when one has easier access to citizenship, it can promote integration. But that doesn't change the fact that crime has to be punished. You have to go to court there. But should it prevent you from having the opportunity to vote for a parliamentary election or to travel around the world? No, it shouldn't be done unless you've been punished. But if you don't get citizenship, then you're just gonna get the rights that Mr. Marcus Knuth and I have in the country in which we live, live and are raised.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163950	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302163951	But my whole point is that they should not have Danish citizenship at all. If it's the case that you make tough demands, and it's both in relation to permanent stay, in relation to citizenship, and in relation to when you can get it, it's especially for young 18-23-year-olds that these figures are completely crazy... these people don't get Danish citizenship. Because if they first have Danish citizenship, we can never expel them unless they are a real threat to the security of the country. So can the rapporteur not, I think, support the answer that we need to tighten up the rules on who gets citizenship, so that we do not see this pattern of stateless Palestinians, in particular, who commit large-scale crime after they have received the Danish passport?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164031	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164032	Of course, I can't. It is because among the citizens we see applying for citizenship, born and raised in this country, it is still a small minority which is either criminal or becomes criminal. The vast majority of them are citizens like Mr. Marcus Knuth and I or our children who were born and raised in this country. We say to them: Even if you do as we ask, you do not get citizenship because you have committed some stupidity, as Mr. Marcus Knuth or I could have committed in our youth as well. But for them, it will have the consequence that they will not have the opportunity to vote in a parliamentary election.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164107	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mr. Morten Dahlin. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164110	Does Enhedslisten believe that if a foreigner comes to Denmark and commits a serious crime, for example a rape, and is punished, he or she is imprisoned for the rape, then he or she must subsequently be rewarded with Danish citizenship?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164130	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164131	Now that is not what this resolution is about, but if I am going to answer that question, then yes, of course you should be able to do so. It should not be the case that you will be permanently excluded from citizenship because you have committed a criminal act at some point in your life. It is then possible that there should be some kind of vessel's ■ to which I will not be objectionable. In the past there have been, and there are many other countries too. But to say that because one has committed a rape at some point in one's life, one must be permanently excluded from voting for a parliamentary election, I do not think it is a fair punishment to add.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164203	The asker, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164204	Is there a type of crime that Enhedslisten thinks is so serious that Enhedslisten would exclude someone who has committed that crime from obtaining Danish citizenship? I could give two examples: Does the Enhedslisten believe that a person convicted of terrorism should be excluded from obtaining Danish citizenship? Or what about a person convicted of spying for a foreign state, for example Russia, against Denmark, that would be a crime in which to be excluded from Danish citizenship?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164237	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164238	Yeah, and I kind of think well, sir. Morten Dahlin knows that it is already the case today that if you violate section 10 or 11 of the Criminal Code, I cannot remember which one of them is, so the questioner must not hang me on the question of precisely in relation to crimes against state security and terrorism, then you can withdraw citizenship. And that is why I do not wish to deny that situations can arise where they can be done. But that is not what we are talking about here. Here we are talking about whether young people born and raised in Denmark should have the right to vote in the country where they live and work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164313	Thank you to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Marcus Knuth of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164322	Thank you, President. I do not need the great speech notes to say what I think of this resolution. I believe that if we have followed our efforts to tighten up the rules on who can acquire Danish citizenship, we know that we are very opposed to this. Our view has only been strengthened by the answers we have received recently by the Foreign Minister about how many people actually commit crime before or after they have acquired Danish citizenship. It is, unfortunately, a handful of countries that are bouncing out: it is stateless Palestinians, it is Somalis, it is Iraqis, it is Iranians and it is Afghans. And fortunately for that, for the vast majority of EU citizens who acquire Danish citizenship have not really committed large-scale crime before or after they have been awarded it. So it's not like all foreigners can't figure out how to behave. Fortunately, there is a small group that can. However, I would also like to say that there have been some points of view in here from those who reject what, unfortunately, I do not entirely agree with. There are some who say: Well, yes, but compared to people who live here and have been raised here, there are already some lax conditions. But that is, unfortunately, what I am saying to Mr. Lars Aslan Rasmussen has the right conditions, including: the scheme for residents of 18-19 years of age which allows them to obtain permanent residence permits without complying with, for example: the employment requirement. We would much rather make it possible for them to obtain a temporary residence permit, and if it were the case that they did not commit crime at all, they would be able to comply with the rules according to the usual conditions. Because that's one of them. the loopholes for 18-19-year-olds, which make it possible to obtain permanent residence permits at the age of 18, citizenship at the age of 19, and then it is no wonder that some people just sit back because they have not been required, thereby committing crime and ending up on transfer income. And that's exactly one of the things that really pops us in the eye. After all, the Minister is right when he says that there have been several tightenings, but it is of no use that we tighten up if it is the case that there are huge, huge gaps in the legislation, where you can suck through and get a permanent residence permit at the age of 18, and then you can bypass the employment requirement for citizenship, because a derogation can be sought again for 18-22 year olds. So in those words, we do not support the proposal as it stands here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164542	There is a brief comment from Mrs Susan Kronborg. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164545	To the rapporteur for the speech. I would like to hear what Conservatives think about this example I have taken with me today. It is Eldison who was born in Aalborg and raised on Als. He is not a criminal and has attended kindergarten and primary school and has been given an apprenticeship as a freight forwarder. But like many others, 19,000 other adults who were born and raised in Denmark, he does not have Danish citizenship. The explanation is that Eldison's parents have come to Denmark as refugees from Yugoslavia. He says himself that it feels as if he is not on the team, and he sees it as a lack of acceptance by Denmark. What does the rapporteur think about not being on the team and not being wanted on the team?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164643	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164644	If I may draw a comparison to a good Dane who lives near, a little south of Køge, Jan Henrik Thun: been a soldier at the Gardehusar Regiment. He didn't feel he had to take the birth test because it was so foreign to him, since he's a pear. So I helped him and I'm sure the rapporteur can remember that and he took up a case on the Committee of Insights. He has now received Danish citizenship or rather, he has to handshake the good handshake here in a few weeks. I'm telling you because that's what's so good about our system. Yes, we make strict demands, but when there are exceptions, and there will always be when it comes to so many people, we have the Committee on Bodily Rights where we can, fortunately, grant exemptions in such cases.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164744	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164746	Thank you very much for your answer. Yes, then I would like to hear what the Conservatives think about Eldison being, in theory, a Muslim, in that his parents have fled from former Yugoslavia, and that we know that New Citizens and DF have gone out publicly that they always, consistently, vote no to Muslims. What do Conservatives think about that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164812	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164813	I think the rapporteur knows my answer to that: we do not discriminate on the basis of religion.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164819	Then we say thank you to the Conservative rapporteur there are no more brief remarks. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Morten Messerschmidt from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302164830	Thank you, President. On the basis of what Mr. Peder Hvelplund said, there is reason to cause a little over the relationship between being a family and being a people. I do not really believe that there is much difference, apart from the size, that is to say the quantitative ratio. Being a part of a people is based precisely on a trust, an immediacy, a familiarity with history, language, humor, culture, all the things that allow us to talk about a •us •us. We often talk when we discuss peoples about common traits: the humor of the Brits, the way the Americans party, the way the Germans speak and act. And so we also have a common perception of what it is that binds us together as people. This is also true in a family where you may sometimes be a little tired at family parties, if you may have an aunt who must always be the first on the dance floor, and an uncle who is always the first to empty a bottle of wine etc. Something's tying us together. That is why it is also to turn things upside down when Mr. Peder Hvelplund and others on the far left, yes, it is in fact so widely anchored on the left that you have to use the right of birth as an instrument to be integrated. It's just like the picture on that crazy TV show where you enter into the marriage first, in the hope that love then arises afterwards. Of course this must be the case, whether it be for your country, for your new home country or for your spouse to be there first before you enter into the binding agreement, as it is to say: yes, I am 100 per cent. Danish, I am willing to give my life for Denmark. Or, yeah, I'm 100 percent. committed to the marriage, the bond that we bind for God and every man. The two are closely linked. That is why it is also so important that we think about the right of birth as a relation of what we know from our family, and that of course we do not have as little as we are willing to give our children to husbands, we do not trust that we give our consent that they must enter into marriage, even though it does not have much legal significance anymore; it is back from the time of Jeronimi. But in the same way, we must be sure that those we give birth to are, of course, also some that we can count as ourselves, as ours. The many restrictions for which the government must be given the Cadeau, although it may well be better that has been implemented, are precisely an attempt to correct the anomaly, the erroneous state of the whole area of citizenship, which has been surrounded by the past 30 years. There is no wonder, of course, that the party which has its name clinging to, I would say at least in the last 100 years' greatest disasters in the history of Denmark from the loss of South Jutland, the occupation in 1940, the membership of the European Community and the law on foreigners of 1983 are of course marching in the diametrically opposite direction. There is nothing strange about Scavenii, Munchs, Hørups and Brandes' party wanting to throw birthright in grams, all the time they want to break down the family. They hate the family as the bond that is given, as much as they are called the nation as the bond that is the handed down. That is why this proposal is in beautiful association with the whole of radical thinking and therefore also something which, of course, must be met with indulgence by every citizen and just a quiet one: no thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165247	There is a brief comment from Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165251	Thank you very much to the Danish People's Party. I would very much like to hear from the rapporteur whether there is any view that Marie Krarup of the Danish People's Party has publicly stated that she is consistently voting against Muslim candidates on the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165314	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165314-2	Yes, the politics of the Danish People's Party is a complete escape. It is not the case that all Muslims in Denmark are a problem, but one has to say that the far, largely problem of foreigners in Denmark can be attributed to the Muslims who are here, and therefore it is just a safe way to prevent the problem from getting bigger. There are, therefore, many good ways to be legal in Denmark without having the right of birth which makes you part of the Danish family and which, of course, gives the special protection that you cannot be expelled from the country as a starting point.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165351	The next question is Mr. Peder Hvelplund from Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165355	Thank you for that and also thank the rapporteur for the picturesque example of the television programme, which is apparently called "Married at first sight," I think it was. But let's just take that example, and let's say that Gerda and Hassan have become fond of each other and want to move in together. They know each other very well. They really want to be part of each other and share life together. But Gerda has committed some kind of crime as a young man. Let us say that Gerda and Hassan are now approaching the age of 40 and want to marry. Then we say you can't do that because Gerda committed a criminal act at the age of 16. Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, is it reasonable that we should set up such rules so that people can benefit from each other?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165448	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165449	Now the listeners have to understand the allegory. Because, at first sight, I do not believe that people should be prevented from entering into marriage if they are criminals, even hardened criminals. I even think that people like Peter Lundin and others are offered marriage in prison etc. But should we use the parallelism? Because I believe that there is a direct connection between loving your family and loving your country and that that is the feeling that must be present when you choose to say that yes, I will join the Danish people and in the whole story that lies. And then, of course, the answer is yes. But there is a difference between birthright and marital rules. I think so, sir. Dolphins are very familiar with.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165539	Here you go. The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165540	Now it was just 'cause mr. Messerschmidt himself used that example, and it is precisely one of the absurdities that exists in relation to being able to acquire citizenship. Then let me ask you another way. In other words, if you meet all the conditions for obtaining citizenship in Denmark and are a full part of society, live here, work here, have taken education, have had family, have had children and are thus part of Denmark, Mr. Mr Messerschmidt saw that it is reasonable that one should still be excluded from becoming a full member when, moreover, one is fully part of it in all other areas?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165618	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165619	No. There may be plenty of examples where it is unreasonable. That's what I was talking about, too. Valentine earlier. We're just in two different places. Sir. Whoops says where he says what is the starting point of the individual, that is, the individual? I don't. My starting point is what is right and what is good for Denmark. And when, for so many years, we have let so many people in, given citizenship to some who should never have had it, we are no longer in a position where we can sit and deal with such a single matter. So we have to ask: What is it that the Danes' home needs? That is where we stand in two very different places.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165700	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302165721	For decades a broad majority in the Folketing has thrown around with Danish citizenships to quite incredible many who should never have had it. A little has been tightened up, but in no way imaginable enough. The Danish citizenship is a gift which must be the very, very few for granted. I don't want it to be something that's easy to get. Denmark is already heavily affected today by decades of totally misguided immigration policy, and that must and must be stopped, and that is why we must of course also drastically limit the granting of Danish citizenship. We cannot possibly support this resolution because it represents the usual radical naivety. In a Copenhagen City Court ruling, two young men were convicted of hundreds of different conditions, including the rape of a 14-year-old girl. The rape they filmed, just as they subsequently shared the video material on the Internet. If access to citizenship is reinstated under section 3.a, as Radicals propose, then one of the perpetrators would actually have qualified for citizenship under section 3.a. The fact that the perpetrator couldn't get it anyway would only depend on whether the police had discovered the crime in time. In this case, the police could reach it, among other things. because the two foreigners had a habit of filming their crimes, including the rape of the only 14-year-old girl. For a scheme that grants young citizenship, if they have been resident in Denmark for 12 years and passed primary school by 02, is of course not a good assessment of whether anyone deserves Danish citizenship. And that is why this proposal simply makes absolutely no sense. It did not make sense the last time it was put forward or the last time it was put forward, nor does it make any sense now. In New Citizens we do not believe that Danish citizenship should be given to immigrants and descendants from Muslim countries where we know that immigrants and their descendants are much more likely to commit crime than Danes when they arrive here. We do not believe that Danish citizenship should be granted laxly, but with care and significantly fewer than it is today; only to the few who really benefit Denmark. We believe that if you commit crime and get an unconditional sentence of liberty, you must have taken away your Danish citizenship, and that is an important part of the task that we have undertaken, namely to solve immigration policy from the bottom up. It is our duty and it is our responsibility to ensure that Denmark is also Danish in 100 years' time. Because we owe it to our children and our grandchildren. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170021	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170027	Thank you to the new citizens, and thank you to the rapporteur. I would really like to hear about the position on something. If you are not a Danish citizen, you cannot actually be trained as a police officer or a prisoner, and does the rapporteur and the New Citizens' Party have a position on this, and will New Citizens be open to considering the possibility of removing the requirement for citizenship in connection, for example, with prison service training?
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170102	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170112	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170116	Thank you to the rapporteur of the new citizens. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Sikandar Siddique from the Free Greens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170122	Thank you for the floor, President. First of all, thank you very much to the Radical Left for making this proposal. See, in the Free Greens we believe that democracy is best organized by those who live in democracy. That is what democracy is all about: democracy, democracy, democracy and democracy. But unfortunately in Denmark over 440,000 people who live here work here, contribute here, pay taxes here are set outside democracy. They're out of control. Every 10 children born in Denmark are born without a Danish citizenship, i.e.: born without equal opportunities, born without the same opportunities as other children born in the same place. I have called this a democratic apartheid in the past. It is certainly a democratic deficit. It is a democratic deficit for our society, for democracy and for the individual. It is simply not worthy of democracy. Up on the audience row there are two young men. Both are internship with the Free Greens. They're both happy to live, they're both committed, they both want society, they both want democracy. The difference is that one of the young people has citizenship while the other does not have citizenship. They're in the same class, but they don't have the same options. One of them can be involved when he's 18 years old... to help determine how this society is to be organized. The other one can't be in it. The other can go to school here, work here, contribute here, pay tax here, but cannot decide what home, Denmark, should look like. Of course it is completely crazy that if you are born in Denmark, you do not automatically acquire Danish citizenship. So, of course, the Greens support the proposal. But a bigger problem is the underlying problem here is that there is a large part of the Danish parliament that does not see young people with a minority background born in Denmark as Danish. It is, of course, the view of people that you do not want them to have Danish citizenship. During this whole debate we have heard politicians, my colleagues, talk about: Well, what if you commit crime, then you have to be able to have Danish citizenship? But there are also ethnic Danes who commit crime. We're not taking their passports from them. So the view of the human being that you don't want to give these young people, these children born in Denmark • whose parents may also be born here, whose grandparents came here • a Danish citizenship is that to this day you still don't see them as equal citizens, as equal Danish young people and children. It upsets me, and I know it upsets many young people. So in addition to supporting this proposal, it is absolutely crucial for the Free Greens to send a clear and clear signal to all of you young people out there: you are at least as Danish as any of us in here. You're at least as good as any of us are in here. You have at least as much right to decide what our society should look like. Fourth Vice-President, I'm sorry. Direct charges apply in this way too. ) I'm sorry, President, emotions got away with me. My point is: we need to see each other as equal citizens, and on the basis of that principle we need to formulate our policies. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170610	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170614	Thank you very much for your support for the motion for a resolution and thank you very much to the rapporteur. I would like to know whether the rapporteur has any comments on the fact that the conclusions of the Institute for Human Rights report show that the long road to citizenship is alienating young people. I have also similarly heard from young people who simply experience this hedge race towards citizenship as a shock when they find that they cannot vote like their comrades. I would like to know whether the rapporteur has any comments on this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170658	Well, I think it's completely crazy. Imagine from here, from this Parliament hall, sending a signal to the young people and telling them that they are not really Danish. That's what you do. That is exactly what you do, and then you hide it behind some tale that it is because there are also some who have got it that should not have it. Yeah, I'm sure there is. Surely there are some who think that we would rather have been free of the person. But should we punish all the other beautiful young lives, beautiful young people, because there are other people doing it wrong? No, it is so undemocratic and certainly not worthy of the rule of law. So these are my comments to the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170757	Thank you to the rapporteur for the Free Greens. The next rapporteur is the rapporteur for the authors of Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302170820	Thank you for the floor and thank you for the debate. In the Radical Left, we believe that children and young people who have been born and raised in this country and who have not committed crime should have easier access to Danish citizenship when they reach the age of 18 or pass the elementary school's graduation examination. One should not be a stranger in the country in which one was born and raised, and therefore it is also stipulated in the European Convention on Civil Liberties that Denmark has a contractual obligation to facilitate access to Danish citizenship for persons born and raised in Denmark. Indeed, in Radical terms, we have the essential value of respecting the principles of law and conventions which we have endorsed, partly because we support the principles of international law, including international law, and partly because a small country like Denmark would be unfavorable if larger and stronger powers, inspired by Denmark, started an international free-booting chaos without regard to international agreements. The proposals of radicals reflect a thinking which is not only reflected in the Convention but is also reflected in the state of law since 1776. Since the Regulation of Accession of 1776 a person born in Denmark has automatically acquired Danish citizenship at the age of 19 unless the person concerned has previously made a declaration not to wish to acquire Danish citizenship. This automatic acquisition of nationality was replaced in 1950 by a declaration system for, inter alia: all foreigners between 21 and 23 years of age who were born in Denmark and had remained resident here. After all, 1999 saw a break and the declaration system was tightened by the introduction of the rule of good repute. In 2004, the declaration system was abolished for non-Nordic young people, and then we came back to the old rules again. In 2014, the Social Democracy and Radical Left reinstated the declaration scheme, but the Left Government then removed the scheme in 2016. If we look back to 1776, it was then apparent from the regulation on citizenship that, when they remain here in the state, the children of immigrants must be considered to be perfect natives. The government and its foreign political support parties, the Left, Conservatives, Liberal Alliance, DF and NB, do not agree with that. Instead, they have spoken of not esteeming unborn children and not considering them as perfect natives. Whether the retention of the present process mostly reminds us of Kafka's trial or the maze of King Minos is a matter of taste, but the result is the same. Many skilled citizens that Denmark needs must go through a hedge race to obtain full citizenship rights in Denmark. If we in Radicals once again take this proposal in the Chamber, it is because we see a frightening trend spreading. It's about division. I therefore call on you to consider that the regulation of 1776 was intended to ensure that the indigenous subjects were given the right of employment in the country's offices and that it was adopted as part of the construction of the Danish nation. With the wise words, I would urge all parties to vote in favour of reintroducing the former section 3A and thus reintroducing the rules we have had for 200 years. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302171231	Thank you to the rapporteur. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Sikandar Siddique. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302171234	First of all, thank you very much to the rapporteur for the proposal, but also thank you for the fact that the rapporteur is always very well prepared and is doing a thorough job. Free Greens absolutely support the proposal. The Radical Left has also, it can be said, become wiser in the sense that since 2019 the Free Greens have said to the support parties: Friends, let us all on the left tell the government that we will not support the government if we do not change course in foreign policy. And so the Radical Left has done so now we just need to get the other support parties in. I look forward to the committee reading and I hope that the Radical Left, as a support party, can persuade the government to support the proposal because this is about democracy, about the rule of law, about equality. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302171341	Thank you. Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302171342	Thank you very much for your comment, and yes, it is an ongoing process. Let's see. I have to admit, sometimes I get a little tired. But at least I always get a little more energy when I talk to Mr. Knox. Sikandar Siddique and also with Mr. Peder Hvelplund and also with SF, who isn't here now. But at least it's nice if nothing else to trample along in the same direction, and then we hope we get more.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302171428	No one else has asked for the floor. The debate is closed. I propose that the motion for a resolution be referred to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220302171451	There is therefore no more to be done in this sitting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Friday 30 November 2007, at 3 pm. 10:00.
