ParlaMint-DK_20220405130951	I understand that we have the technique in place. We can now start the party leader debate. It is an extended party leader debate, so we also have representatives of the North Atlantic mandates present. It is the case that the government does not participate as a government but participates as a party. That is why we do not use ministerial names either, but Mr. or ma'am, first of all. And then I have to say that every party leader has three minutes' speaking time from the start. Then you have to remember that there are two lines, but only in 1⁄2 minutes. That does not prevent us from having a few hours ahead of us, I would like to say. But remember, it's only 1⁄2 minute and not 1 minute and then 1⁄2 minute. This means that we are now ready to start. I do not welcome the Prime Minister, but welcome Mrs Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131046	Thank you. The war in Ukraine hangs like a shadow over our continent, all over Europe, and the horrific and heartbreaking images we see, among other things. from Butja, shows the incredible brutality of the Russian invasion. What we are experiencing now underlines the need to strengthen sanctions against Putin. We are working on this in the European Union together with our Western allies. At the same time, we have a great common responsibility to accept the thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the horrors of war. Denmark is united in helping. We have to hold on to that. It will be a great task to help the Ukrainians while they are here in Denmark. It is estimated that up to 30,000 Ukrainians have already come to Denmark and more will come. The government and the authorities work closely with the municipalities to carry out the task as best they can. But whatever we do, such a great influx will be felt so quickly by all of us. We are therefore also faced with difficult choices and dilemmas. In the municipalities, you work hard to find homes. It's going to challenge in school classes, day care, health care, all aspects of our welfare. We need to do this by working together and we need everyone's help, whether you are authority or you are civil society. The war in Ukraine can also be felt on the wallet. Last week we agreed on an increased heat check for even more households. Thank you to the parties behind that deal. The government is, of course, constantly considering whether we can do even more. I know that many people are under pressure on the economy and the lower their income, the higher the cost of inflation, both because of the high energy prices and developments in general. Everyone here at Christiansborg knows we can't keep everyone safe. We do not know how long this conflict is going on and how great the consequences will be, but we also know, on the other hand, that it is hurting the economy of many people already now. We must continue to maintain the strongest possible pressure on Russia. Therefore, Denmark must be independent of Russian energy as soon as possible. After Easter, the government will present the play-out • Denmark can more 2°, where we will come up with some of our proposals for an ambitious and faster green transition, more renewable energy, faster independence from Russian gas. All of this, of course, for the benefit of the climate and safety, but also for the benefit of the individual consumer. And most importantly: for peace and for freedom in Europe. In Greenland a new coalition was agreed yesterday between IA and Siumut, a new Naala Suisut. I look forward to continued good cooperation in the Kingdom community.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131354	Thank you. I would like to point out that I take the questions in the order in which they have been put here, and first it is Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen-Jensen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131403	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to the President of the Social Democratic Party. The war crimes in Ukraine are absolutely terrible, and what we saw from Butja this weekend is terrible. At the same time, we have the situation that we are helping to finance some of it through our purchase of Russian gas. As we agreed in the national compromise, there is therefore reason to get rid of the dependence on a despot and war criminal that we have no desire to support as soon as possible. When does the Prime Minister think we can be independent of Russian gas?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131441	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131442	I do not dare to set a precise date yet, but that is, of course, one of the things we need to look at together, that is, the parties behind the national compromise, but also others who are also concerned that we will have to use Russian gas. I am thinking here, among other things. in a party like Enhedslisten, which I know has the same wish. And we have to get as close as possible. We have to do that in Denmark, but we also have to do that in Europe, because our gas supply is linked to the rest of the continent. So it is an important discussion to have both in Denmark and in Europe, and fortunately a large part of the parties here in the Folketing agree that this should be done as soon as possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131513	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131514	Thank you. In our national compromise, we agreed that this was also something that the parties to the agreement should address, and I am pleased to hear that the government will present this immediately after Easter. I just want to make sure that this is something that has to be done between the parties to the agreement here, as we have promised each other in this compromise.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131537	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131538	It is an important part of the national compromise that we want to make ourselves independent of Russian gas and, in my view, it is just as important as the other decisions taken as part of the national compromise, because things are connected. Energy policy is not just energy policy, it is also security policy. But I hope that we will be open to other parties in the Folketing too being able to participate in this important work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131558	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131600	The tragic events in Ukraine also mean that in these days we are receiving many, many refugees. And the challenges are great in the different municipalities. We are going to see it in the area of children, especially because half of the refugees who are are children. It's gonna be a big job for all of us. It also matters how we finance that task, and right now we have chosen to use some of the development aid to finance it. But if we're talking about 100,000 refugees, we're talking about taking 10 billion. kr. from development aid. And I just want to make it very clear that SF is not willing to do so. Does the government see an opportunity to look elsewhere?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131635	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131636	In other words, if we look into receiving up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, this will be a task of a scale that we, who sit in this room, can hardly imagine. The first and greatest challenge is, of course, that we hardly have any unemployment in our society, what is right, really positive, but that means that there are no unemployed educators and teachers, child care providers or technicians or others to hire. And that is why we need a welfare society to be able to help many more people than society is capable of today with the challenges that already exist. So the task is enormous, and that also applies to the financing part.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131713	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131713-2	Yes, because the funding is a little bit about whether it is the poorest in the world who have to finance some of those who are on the run. And the challenge is no less when you look at the African continent, which has been financed, among other things. by the Russians and the Chinese through their investments. So the Russians are not investing so much now, so we are looking into increasing famine; we are looking into increasing radicalisation. We also look into the possibility of increasing migration from the African continent. That is where our development aid goes. So I would like the Prime Minister to give a little more thought to the future of development aid and the needs of Africa.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131749	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131750	This is very difficult to do in just 30 seconds, so I agree that the challenges we face on the African continent are also very, very severe. This is true in the Sahel region, and that is true around the Nile. Now radicalisation and famine are being pointed out; we may also be facing a food crisis due to the war in Ukraine. So I agree with the analysis of how important it is also to give priority to the African continent. And that must, of course, be reflected in our priorities at all. And then we have to pay close attention to the fact that we also have a well-functioning welfare society on the other side of this crisis.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131827	Sir. Alex Vanopslagh, LA.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131828	Thank you. The Social Democratic President stood down here in the Chamber last week and said that she had no ambition to raise the tax for the Danes. Before the last elections, the current Finance Minister said that 95 per cent. of the Danes would not experience tax increases under a red government. But here we stand for a few years in the parliamentary term: the government has raised taxes more than 40 times, and it has affected all income groups in Denmark. There is not a bird, there is not a fish, there is not a frog in Denmark that has not experienced tax increases, and my question is actually just: why does the Social Democrat President not know that this is a government that is happy with tax increases?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131904	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131905	That is because it is not a government that welcomes tax increases. It is quite true that we, together with many different parties in the Danish Parliament, have chosen to raise some taxes, including taxes. on cigarettes. This is not something I have ever been a great supporter of, but, on the other hand, I have to say that in the name of public health, increasing taxes on cigarettes can be a good thing. We have also lowered taxes in a number of areas, so fortunately the picture is slightly more nuanced than it is reproduced here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131934	Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405131935	But if you are not happy with tax increases, I hope that you will not raise taxes 40 times more, as has been done so far in this period. When you ask the government economists in the Ministry of Finance to count on the consequences of the government's tax policy, it shows that all income groups in Denmark have been affected and the poorest have been hit hardest, and for the same reason the economic inequality has increased during this parliamentary term. The last question actually sounds quite simple: can we expect more tax increases that increase inequality and make all Danes poorer, or do we want to change the path of Social Democracy and start to lower taxes for the joy and benefit of all Danes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132008	Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132008-2	Now, of course, I cannot give a full answer to that question in 30 seconds, but we are going to have to negotiate a major tax reform in the whole climate area with uniform CO2 so perhaps we should also take the discussion at the negotiating table.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132032	Then it's Mrs. Pernille Vermund, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132033	Thank you. I am not impressed by what Mrs Mette Frederiksen has done for the Danes, but I am impressed by what Mrs Mette Frederiksen has managed to gain from power over two of the opposition's party leaders, Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen-Jensen and Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr It is impressive to see how the two gentlemen come when they are called, respond with a yes when asked, and line up for photography when they have to sign. I do not want to ask how Mrs Mette Frederiksen does it, but I would like to ask how it feels.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132105	Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132106	I think that is an unnecessary comment in a cooperative popular government. I mean, there are a number of parties that have chosen to take responsibility. There is war on the continent of Europe. We want to strengthen Denmark's security and defence, and we have then chosen in the past week to travel out to back up our sendees. I believe that the fact that we can work together may mean more than many of us here once in a while understands the importance, especially when the crisis is of the caliber that it is now. I don't think it's time for division or for the hard words against each other. I think it's time to work together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132143	Mrs. Pernille Vermund, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132145	I understand that the Prime Minister is happy and proud, because with the defence agreement Mrs Mette Frederiksen has succeeded in getting both Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen and Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen-Jensen to debt Denmark and at the same time release a greater billions which the government will be able to release to the left in the autumn, and that is really good work. On top of that, Mrs. Mette Frederiksen even managed to get Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen to tell the press afterwards that the tax relief would probably be a little heavy in the future. Can Mrs Mette Frederiksen just lift off the veil a little bit about what was going on behind the scenes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132218	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132219	It seems that there are some blue parties that need to have a discussion between each other. I do not want to interfere with that, but when I look at it as the Prime Minister of the country, as I am in today's debate, I am glad that when there is a war in Ukraine, when there is a potential food crisis going on, when there is a refugee crisis of a magnitude that we may not have seen for many, many years, and when inflation is rising, we are a number of parties who, instead of arguing with each other and being polemical, sit down at the negotiating table. I think that suits those who take responsibility.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132255	Sir. Morten Messerschmid, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132256	Thank you, President. I'm not going to dwell, like the previous one, on the Prime Minister's emotional life. On the other hand, I would like to ask a little about the national compromise and, in particular, its launch. At the press conference which launched the big agreement, the word'reserve' was used 27 times, using the word 'EU' 54 times. The word 'European', on the other hand, was mentioned only four times, and the word 'no', ten times. Nevertheless, we have chosen to draw up a ballot paper which is just the opposite, which speaks of European and not the European Union, and there is no mention of the reservation. Can the Prime Minister take us in on how this happened?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132341	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132341-2	First of all, I should like to say that I have not spoken up words either before the agreement was drawn up, in the text of the agreement, at the press conference or afterwards. What we are voting on on 1 June is basically whether we want to be involved in both taking responsibility, but also more committed to our own security and European security, and thus to defence cooperation, and that will require us to settle with the reservation. So that is what we are voting on 1 July.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132410	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132411	But why isn't it on the ballot? Why is the word reserved there? Why is the word EU not there? Could the Prime Minister, in the same rebirth, answer whether she has approved the text which appears to be now in the draft law?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132425	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132428	It is always the case that I am, of course, involved in making legislative proposals. I haven't been much involved in this directly, but of course it's been over me, what's quite natural, and I'm very, very much on target for that. Right now it says as it stands: Act on Denmark's participation in European cooperation in the field of security and defence. That is, in fact, what we have to decide on on 1 June.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132448	Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132450	Thank you. I would like to follow on from Mr Seligman. Mr Ellemann-Jensen-Jensen's question relates to the green area, where, as the Prime Minister also said about these tragic war crimes in Butja, we demand that, in order to stop all this, we drained Putin's box. We cannot do that tomorrow, we cannot do that next week, but we can make decisions and show the rest of Europe that we can actually deliver green electricity. So, with regard to the negotiations on green tax reform, for example, and what the Prime Minister announces, will it be convened and when?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132528	Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132529	I share the analysis; we must free ourselves from Russian gas and, in general, from Russian energy supply. We have to do this in terms of security and in order to get there as the honourable Member wishes. And we must be free of fossil fuels in general, given the climate. We come up with our thoughts immediately after Easter. They are in line with the agreement we have reached on the national compromise, and then negotiations will begin, including with regard to green tax reform.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132600	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132601	Thank you. I look forward to that very much. Following on from Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhrs's question, I would like to ask about the financing of the many refugees who are now coming and probably twice as many, it is already apparent, here after Easter, that there is funding for. I welcome the announcement from the Ministry of Finance that this is now an extraordinary situation. Then I would just like to confirm that it is also the case that we will then be able to finance the many more refugees who are coming so that all development aid will not be undermined.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132636	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132637	So, first of all, I think it is perfectly natural for the DAC, as stated in political language, to be able to take part in development aid and use when refugees are here for the first 12 months, as I remember. This is something we have been doing in Denmark for 30 years, so there is nothing new in it. However, it goes without saying that we cannot do this in such a way that there is nothing left to develop, both for the sake of the African continent and our desire to combat poverty and other very, very important priorities, and in that we must find a balance. But all in all, the time to come is to find the right balance in everything, because we have almost only difficult questions ahead of us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132715	Sir. Edmund Joensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132717	Thank you, and thank you for a good speech. The party leader from the Social Democratic Party has said on several occasions that the Faroe Islands wanted a new trade agreement and supports that work. The world is in a new situation, we have war in Europe and it will cost the Faroe Islands dearly. Then my question is whether it will change the situation as regards the Faroe Islands being able to obtain a new and better trade agreement. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132753	Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132754	First of all, I welcome the fact that both the Faroe Islands and Greenland have chosen to join in the sanction trail that we have agreed in the European Union with our allies and that, of course, both Faroese and Greenlandic have emphasised that you are part of the West and that that is where you perceive yourself and work from. And we warmly support what we can now contribute to ensuring better trade agreements, and that cooperation has already been established.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132823	Edmund Joensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132824	Thank you. As I said, it seems that it will cost the Faroe Islands dearly, and the Faroe Islands must find an alternative to their products. So a better trade agreement with the European Union is very important. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132843	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132844	Yes, it is and it is true that it costs, and the whole discussion has so far reflected that it is expensive when we have an aggressive Putin when there is war on our continent. It's gonna have secondary consequences everyone's gonna feel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132914	Then it's Mai Villadsen, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132916	Thank you. In his speech, the Prime Minister said that the war can hit everyone on the wallet, and I think there are a lot of people who are concerned about that now, not least the people who are on a national pension, early retirement, cash benefits or some of the other transfer income that is constantly being reduced. It has its own history here at Christiansborg. There was a political rapporteur for the Enhedslisten who stood out here a few years ago and said some very little flattering things about a social democratic government because they chose to make less provision for transfer income. But it happens now, it hits these people, so don't we have to do something about it now?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132952	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405132952-2	Well, as I said before, we are always thinking about how we do this job best, and I am painfully aware that the lower the income you have, the harder it hits. This applies to energy prices, to the price of petrol, and also to food prices, and right now you are hit all three places, in other words on energy, on fuel and on food. If you are a national pensionist and do not have a large pension savings or a high free value, you will be affected now. We are very aware of this, and one of the things we are going to discuss with each other is how we do this most wisely.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133027	Mai Villadsen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133027-2	Yes, because there is a year left of minor regulation from the tax agreement that was made about 10 years ago, but it could be a rather fatal year, because prices just go up and if you do not regulate your transfer income, your pension or cash benefits, then you can really stand in a difficult place. So I really hope this is a signal from the government that you are willing to look at that too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133053	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133053-2	It is quite true that less regulation is hitting harder now than it has done in previous years. It's a lot of people getting hit now. You can also be at work and maybe live somewhere in the province and need two cars to do your job at all, or you have an oil guy or a gas guy, and the price has risen. There you can feel it in the economy too. We must then strike a balance in what we have of opportunities, without telling anyone that we will be able to lift all the burdens off their shoulders, but so that we can give a helping hand where the need is greatest, and I look forward to a further discussion of that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133132	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133134	Thank you. I am very pleased that the Danish Parliament is in the middle of imposing sanctions with the rest of the European Union. We are behind our soldiers, we are largely behind NATO and we are fighting together. Then we have a refugee situation which is becoming more and more serious and which we must work hard to resolve. Now I think that the healthiest thing in the world is to support oneself and one's, so should we not do it in such a way that we eliminate or clear up some of the bureaucracy along the way, so that the Ukrainians who come here can get to work more quickly when there are a lot of people standing there who want to spend them instead of waiting 60-70 days to take a job at all?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133210	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133211	Yes, it must be done as quickly as possible, and the municipalities have a great responsibility for this. We must do what we can to support it, by the way in close cooperation with companies. We should remember that it is also the case that we have chosen to say that when you are a refugee from Ukraine, you can enter Denmark, and then it is only afterwards that we get the formal process in place in relation to stay. And we are not going to get around the fact that at some point in this process we have to be sure who is coming here, who is part of the family and what the conditions are, and we cannot just do that overnight. But yes, we must make every effort to ensure that this happens as quickly as possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133245	Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133246	Of course we have to be sure of it, but now we have made a special law for the Ukrainians, and of course we have done so, because we think it is something special that is our immediate area. Perhaps one could imagine that we could do a little extra; it might be that we should talk to some more ministers about whether we could turn it up even more and get even more people out and take the tests that now need to be taken so that people get to work. Well, this is going to be expensive, and instead of people coming here being a big cost, let them go out and earn their own money themselves and pay some taxes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133317	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133317-2	We must get the Ukrainians to work, and I would say that with regard to the Ukrainians I have had the opportunity to speak to myself, and that is also what I have been referred to by others, there is a group of people in which many people already indicate that they want to return home and help build up their country of origin and the pride of Ukraine is clearly very, very great but there is also a very strong desire to work. So let us promise each other that we will solve this refugee crisis in a different way than we have managed to do for 40 years, by this time ensuring that people actually get to work and just support themselves and pay taxes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133350	Sir. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133350-2	Thank you, President. Yesterday there was a rather gloomy report from the UN climate panel saying that we have less time to stop emissions than we had thought. If it turns out that we are well located in Denmark; we are one of the leading countries • that we actually have to increase our savings in order to help achieve our goal, will the Prime Minister help to discuss whether we really have to set our CO2 by 2030, if that is necessary for us to do our part?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133422	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133422-2	We absolutely must do our part and, by the way, we are one of the countries with the most ambitious climate targets already. I think that we will reach each other at a very early stage in this discussion, because, as several people have already asked, we need to free ourselves from Russian gas and Russian energy as soon as possible, and the best way to solve it is through renewable energy. Here I am going to ask a question later today the other way, because some of the things that slow us down in constructing a very renewable energy can sometimes be climate considerations, where we also come into some dilemmas about how we ensure that renewable energy is actually speeded up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133500	Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133500-2	Fortunately, the climate report says that renewable energy is becoming cheaper. Wind, sun, etc. is becoming cheaper. That's one of the good things. I would like to ask the Prime Minister about the emissions taking place outside Denmark. When our ships, our aircraft, our trucks come outside Denmark, we do not get the CO2 calculated. Could we imagine that we are the country that works hardest in the United Nations to secure a global climate budget so that from above we get distributed responsibility that the different countries have for the settlement of the CO2
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133530	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133530-2	I am always open to discussing things, but I am actually most concerned that we are doing the job we have already done ourselves. We are well in the process of doing so, but we need to do so more quickly. We need more renewable energy now and we need it to be built faster than what we have been able to achieve so far because of the crisis we have in Europe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133559	Sikandar Siddique, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133600	Thank you for the floor. That is why, in the Free Greens, we tabled the proposal for a Climate Act 2.0 so that we could just count our shipping imports, etc. Into these climate goals. However, following on from this IPCC report, which says that we need to halve our global emissions by 2030, I would like to know whether this gives the government, Minister, Mrs Mette Frederiksen the opportunity to reconsider and reopen the agreements that have been reached, for example. To leave all coal, gas and oil in the ground, that is to say to bring forward the oil freeze agreement which is now in 2050. In other words, do the conclusions of the report give rise to the reopening of the agreements reached in the Folketing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133640	Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133641	I must be quite honest and say that what gives me the most cause for reflection now is the war in Ukraine and how to resolve it. And the way out of what we stand in Ukraine is independence from Russian gas. It's one of the roads out there. But we have made a national compromise. It is a very, very good piece of political work. It says that we must be independent of Russian gas, but we will, of course, enter into a discussion in Europe on whether we would rather use fossil fuels from our own countries for a period of time, in other words potentially increasing production in some of our own Member States instead of relying on Russian gas, which would be better from a safety point of view.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133718	Sikandar Siddique, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133719	Well, you could say that one doesn't rule out the other. And, of course, Mrs Mette Frederiksen must be preoccupied with the invasion we are experiencing right now in Ukraine. After all, the IPCC report also says that if we are to achieve a goal, we must revolutionise agriculture. After all, an agreement has been reached here in the Folketing, which preserves animal production. For example, is it... something that Mrs Mette Frederiksen will consider, in other words open up the agricultural agreement, so that animal production can also be included, and so that we can revolutionise agriculture, as the IPCC report recommends?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133752	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133753	Now it's not often that I'm preoccupied with revolutionary things. We chose the path of reform many years ago in the party I represent. I'd like to stay there. On the other hand, I am incredibly concerned that we reach the goal of our climate ambitions. We need independence from Russian gas at a very, very early stage. That's what we're working on now. I think we have a good agricultural agreement and I would like to thank you for the fact that so many parties here in the Danish Parliament have chosen to take responsibility for one of the hardest climate areas. Because we are there in the Danish climate action that now all decisions start to hurt and have really big consequences. So no, I'm not going to terminate the agricultural agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133831	Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133832	Thank you for the floor. It has been a very eventful year in general during this parliamentary term. There has been corona, there is war, and Trump has also said that he wanted to buy Greenland, also during this parliamentary term. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the party chairman, the Prime Minister, for working towards an equal cooperation between Greenland and Denmark. I think that is a very important point to bear in mind. It can be said that, with the war and the uncertainty around the world and with the role that Russia also plays in the Arctic, I would like to ask: how is the President of the Party generally the security policy situation in the Arctic?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133910	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133910-2	I am concerned about this because we also see a more aggressive Russia at all on the international stage. It is not only in and around Ukraine, it is also into Africa, it is in relation to the Balkans, we have seen it via Belarus towards Poland, and we see it in relation to the Arctic. So I am concerned, and I do share the objective of low-voltage, but it takes two to tango, and that is probably not to be said from the platform, because it is English, but when we have an increasingly aggressive Russia, we must also take it down into the work that is going on around the Arctic, also in the kingdom.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133946	Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405133947	Thank you very much. It certainly challenges the work of the Arctic Council and Arctic Parliamentarians, but I share the ideas expressed by the party chairman. After all, the Prime Minister has given an official apology to the experimental children, and I also know that legal orphans are in the process of suing the state. And I would like to ask about this with the Compensation Board, because I also know that there are several parties that have touched on this issue. What are the views of the party chairman as to whether Denmark should have a compensation board?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134015	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134016	I do not have strong views on whether we should have a replacement council. It's not a proposal I'm going to make. I have been engaged in some of the necessary disputes with our history and know, of course, that in terms of both internal Greenlandic conditions and not least the relationship between Greenland and Denmark, the children of experiments have played a very, very important role. For many people, it is like 22 children, but the consequences have been much, much deeper and much wider. And that is why I hope, with the apology given first in Denmark and then in Greenland, that we have put an end to one of the very dark chapters of our modern history.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134055	Sjúrður Skaale, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134055-2	Thank you. As long as Russia commits its bestialous crimes in Ukraine, the European Union cannot, of course, relax the sanctions and, of course, they must be tightened up. However, there is one point where Britain has taken a step that the European Union has not taken, and that is when it comes to closing ports. The European Union has not closed its ports to Russian ships at all, and this is a very fundamental and very important issue and a matter which can have many different consequences, and that is why I ask: where does Denmark stand in this context? In what direction is the EU being tried to influence the closure of ports or not?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134131	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134132	All the way through, and it has only been more up-to-date by what has happened this weekend, which is one of the most violent things we have yet seen in Ukraine, is the view that we want the toughest possible sanctions against Russia and, incidentally, with broad support in the Folketing, and thank you for that. And the Foreign Minister has also said in the past that one of the places you could look at is the port area. Having said that, I would strongly appeal to us to follow the path of sanctions in the European Union together with our allies. Because that's where we're strongest.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134203	Sjúrður Skaale.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134203-2	Thank you. Now, the President mentioned with the allies. After all, an ally is Norway, and if Norway is being pressured to close its ports to Russian ships, it may well happen that the many decades-long fisheries agreements between Russia and many countries in the Arctic are being terminated by Russia. Then they will write their own quotas and maybe we will be faced with an ecological disaster in, for example. The Barents Sea because we do not manage fish stocks together. It is just an angle that one should have in mind when discussing that issue. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134238	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134238-2	Well, there are so many dilemmas in everything that happens as a consequence of the war, and my clear feeling is that it will only be more difficult from here, whether we speak the reception of refugees, we speak the path of sanctions or we speak the situation in Ukraine and the geopolitical reality that will have to be different after 24 February. From here there are only dilemmas and difficult decisions. But fortunately, until now, in a fairly broad majority of this Parliament, I think I have made some very, very good decisions, both in terms of Ukraine, but also in terms of ourselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134315	Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134316	Thank you for the floor. Now both Social Democracy and Siumut are ideologically socialist in their values. We believe in right and duty, and community and freedom go hand in hand, and above all, as is also the case in ideology, we are democratic. Siumut has repeatedly pointed out that there may be democratic deficits in the Kingdom community. Again today, we believe that when we sit here and are not party leaders, it should also be possible for our real party leader in the Kingdom community to also be able to take part in these debates. What does the party leader think of that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134356	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134357	It is not something I have considered, but as a starting point I think it would be strange if people who are not members of the Folketing were involved in a parliamentary debate. In other words, there are 179 members of the Folketing, and we are the only ones who can speak here. Then a very special exception was made last week via a video link to Kyiv, where we had President Zelenskyj with us, but the starting point must be that it is the 179 members of the Folketing who are speaking in this Chamber.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134423	Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134425	Thank you for your answer. Now we can also see that sometimes it can happen where it is that let us say a minister who has not really been elected to the Folketing, also has the opportunity to speak in the Assembly Chamber, for example. Because we are democratically elected in another forum, let us say the European Parliament. That is why I also think that if we are democratic, as we say we are, we should also be able to find some opportunities in that there are people who are democratically elected in the Danish Kingdom who also have the opportunity to take part in debates in an equal way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134457	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134457-2	Now I am not going to interfere in the Rules of Procedure of the Danish Parliament, it is a matter for the Danish Parliament, but if a minister speaks here, it is because the Minister is appointed by the Prime Minister to be a member of the government, and that is another matter. I think it is important that we have equal and respectful cooperation in the Kingdom Community, and so, in all modesty, I also think that we are doing quite a lot to ensure that this is the case and have the impression that all three parties have an experience of a kingdom community that is developing dynamically, respectfully and properly in this time, and so is it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134530	I might add that the video link with Zelenskyj was just in the National Hall and not in the Assembly Hall. Thank you to Mrs Mette Frederiksen, we made it through everything. We shall move on to the rapporteur's report. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134541	Thank you for that, President. Last Sunday we stood up for absolutely horrible pictures from the Ukrainian city of Butja, a city that many of us probably hadn't heard of before. Putin's soldiers have retired. They have left behind death and destruction. Now there are bodies of civilian people lying in the streets. They've been shot, some of them with their hands tied on their backs, and there are also reports of mass graves. Butja is a town that is not very far away, it is not very far from our streets, from our homes, from our families. It's monstrous, and it's deeply despicable. First of all, it is a tragedy for the many people, for the families who now have to bury their loved ones, if they can find them otherwise, and the pictures from Butja at least make me think of some of the absolutely darkest pictures, darkest chapters in the history of Europe, which we have all talked about we didn't think we were going to experience again in our lifetime. We will not forget what has happened in Butja, what has happened in other cities in Ukraine, and all those responsible must the free world condemn the crimes committed. The war has been going on for over a month now, and the devastation and misery are only getting worse every day, and that, of course, raises the question over and over again of what we are doing with Putin's Russia. How do we react to his invasion of a country, how do we respond to his threat to Europe, to his threat to us? In Denmark, among other initiatives, we have responded by reaching a national compromise on Danish security policy. It is an agreement that will strengthen our defence, it is an agreement that will ensure that we are firmly anchored in the alliances that help to create security, stability and freedom in Europe. Now it is about a month since we reached the national compromise, and a significant part of the agreement that we have talked about in the past is that Denmark should be independent of Russian gas. We write precisely that the government and the parties to the agreement agree to discuss concrete measures as soon as possible based on a future energy and supply initiative. In other words, in view of the escalation on the battlefield in Ukraine, an ambitious plan is urgently needed, and that is why I would just like to reiterate my call to speed up the work and I look forward to what the government is presenting here after Easter. Then I would like to stress that I do not believe that the work has been done in making important decisions on more sea winds and other initiatives that will have an impact in the long term. We need to phase out Russian gas, we need to do it now, not in years' time, and if the war continues in the way we have seen it in Butja, I can only see that all European countries are being forced to advance plans for phasing out Russian gas now. It is a massive task for which we must be prepared in Denmark, and I hope that we can meet across the Danish Parliament to get to grips with that task soon. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134908	Thank you. Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134912	I am glad that we are so many parties in the Danish Parliament that support NATO cooperation and the efforts that, among other things, are being made. is going on in the Baltic countries right now. There is no doubt that this is important and we therefore support the fact that we are sending 800 soldiers, as I know the Left is doing. But should not NATO's focus in the future • it really be an open question • not be our territorial defence? Isn't that where NATO really needs to use most of its resources instead of looking at raging around the world, focusing on defending our territory? What does the Left say about that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134950	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405134950-2	It is, of course, the transformation of Danish defence that we have to go through, and I hope it is also for NATO. One can say that the world has changed and the importance of strong territorial defence is very, very clear now. Putin's invasion made sure of that. However, we must not deny that it may be necessary to take responsibility in other parts of the world. We did it years ago when our most important allies, the United States, were attacked from Afghanistan. We helped to take responsibility for a NATO alliance. That is what it is like to be part of NATO.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135026	Pia Olsen Dyhr, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135027	I am glad that the Left also focuses on territorial defence. I think that will simply be the future and what we must invest in when we discuss a defence agreement in Denmark. Some of the issues we are focusing on are also the whole issue of cybersecurity. I know that some people think it is a little funny, but that is actually where we, as a very digital country, are really sensitive. What does the President of the Left see as the prospects for investing in cybersecurity?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135053	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135054	A priority that we absolutely bring with us into the negotiating room when we are going to talk about the next defence settlement is cybersecurity, but it is also the entire Arctic area, and that is the whole issue of military service. There are many things we are going to talk about. And when we are a through-digitalised country, and we are, although it may be that we sometimes think that there is a problem with it, but when we compare ourselves to soon all other countries, we are very, very far ahead, it just means that we are incredibly vulnerable, precisely because we are so effective on that front. So as far as cybersecurity is concerned, we are very much behind.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135129	Mette Frederiksen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135129-2	It was such a fine speech by the President of the Left, and I would just like to agree and thank you for the description of what we are seeing on our continent right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135139	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135140	I agree with the Prime Minister's comment. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135144	I do not suppose there is any need to comment again. Then it's mr. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135149	I would also very much like to agree with you, but Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen did not look with me, as he did with the Prime Minister. Because is there anyone who doesn't think we should phase out Russian gas? I haven't met anyone yet, at least that's very, very few. The big question, the difficult question, as Mr. Mr Ellemann-Jensen. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Ellemann-Jensen on his excellent report. He says the green switch can't handle it. I very much agree with that. I think it's 3%. of the EU's energy consumption, which currently comes from renewable energy sources. So that's not a way to go. So what is it? Could it, for example? is it that part of the recovery fund created by the European Union in relation to corona is being used for energy independence, new ports are being built, etc., so that we can get gas in from the United States?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135232	Thank you. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135233	I mean, there are two challenges with Russian gas. It's Russian, and it's gas. In relation to the gas component, the challenge is indeed the green transition, and we have to respond to that in the long term, but we have to respond to the second part, that is to say that it is Russian, in the short term. One of the things we can do is to turn up biogas; one of the things we can do is to do it more, what can be said, user-friendly for companies to use the business schemes that exist to phase out gas and also to make it easier for consumers to phase out their natural gas boiler. And then we will have to look together at how to strengthen our energy infrastructure in Europe. How do we ensure that we become independent as soon as possible?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135313	Morten Messerschmidt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135314	Well, now we have, among other things. Thanks to sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen's party is a solidarity clause which means that Danish energy produced is European energy produced. So, if I may put it this way that biogas can contribute, it does not suggest much in a European context, in an EU context. So I think it would be a good thing if Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen would deal with the specific proposal I am making, that is to say, compared with the 5 000 billion, I think it is that has been set off as a recovery package after corona, which is earmarked for the green transition, in a group from the Folketing's side to the European Union: there we would like them to be converted into an independence fund that ensures us new investments so that we become independent of Russian gas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135353	Thank you. Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135354	Well, in my optics, you can hit two birds with one stone here. The intention is, of course, to become independent of Russian gas, and it is a matter of urgency, but it is also a matter of having the green transition. And that is also something that we as a country can benefit from, both in order for there to be a country for our children, but certainly also in order for there to be a welfare society for them. Because this is about Danish companies and their ability to sell green conversion in the rest of Europe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135417	Then it's Mai Villadsen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135420	Thank you. And thank you for a really, really nice talk with some very touching and real descriptions of the terrible thing we are seeing right now and which in fact also points to what is the big problem, namely the energy dependence that exists, of Russian gas and of gas at all. I would like to ask about the sanctions, because one is gas, another is oil and coal. I know that there are many people who advocate to share this, but we took the lead in some of the first days of demands with regard to SWIFT and other sanctions, among others. to close the Danish airspace. Should we also do so in connection with oil and coal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135458	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135459	I believe that we share the view that sanctions will work best if they are brought as far as possible. Sometimes the best way to get others to take the lead can be to take the lead, and sometimes it's to stand on the side of the hawks in these discussions. And my appeal to the Danish government has so far been and will continue to be: Make sure you stand on the side of the hawks. We need tough sanctions, and I do not think, in that light, that they can be tough enough.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135528	Thank you. Here you go, Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135530	Thank you. My concern, when I look around the European landscape, is that there are also Orbán and other forces who may not want us to go much further. And that is why I believe that the Danish side should press for this; I am quite convinced of it, but it is also possible to do so by stating clearly that we will then take the lead in Denmark in terms of coal, oil and closing the Danish ports. Couldn't the Left be in on it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135554	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135555	Yeah, we can do that. I suggested that with the ports two days after the invasion, so I think that is a good idea. We can see that there are some things where you don't follow one hundred percent along. The expulsion of Russian spies has happened in such countries, and now we have come for it, and I think that is a good idea. Anyway, it's important that the more we can stand together, the stronger these sanctions work. So let us try to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135622	Sir. Sjúrður Skaale.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135624	Thank you. And thank you for your speech. Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen spoke a lot about the phasing out of Russian gas, and that is of course a good thing, but it is something that can of course only be achieved in the long run. Another measure that has just been talked about, which will affect the Russian economy and thus indirectly the Russian war machine here and now, is the closure of ports for Russian ships. Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen is in favour of this. Can he give us an idea why it didn't happen?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135655	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135657	No, I can't make a bid for that. I think that these are discussions which have also been under European auspices, but for inscrutable reasons I am not invited to Council meetings.

ParlaMint-DK_20220405135711	It's not outlawed, as sir. In his speech, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen also said to take the lead. Nor is there any European command to phase out Russian gas; it is a Danish decision. It could also be a Danish decision to say that we are closing the ports. Well, it would have impact here and now, so why not make a decision about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135734	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135735	There is also an opportunity to do so. What I was trying to say with my speech was that this fills us with a hell of a lot of dilemmas. This applies to our dependence on Russian gas versus the cofinancing of a completely ruthless and brutal war. At the same time, there is the closure of ports to be the world's fifth or sixth largest maritime nation. There are just some dilemmas in this that aren't easy. I just think that what we need to bear in mind is that the evil that we are facing now is so massive that we have to take a strong stand. That is why we also need to make difficult decisions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135811	Edmund Joensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135811-2	Thank you, and thank you for a good speech. It is positive that the Faroe Islands and Greenland are involved in foreign policy and security policy. How does the party leader of the Left intend to influence foreign and security policy, and how will the common thread, which is so important for the unity of the Kingdom community, be found?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135850	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135851	Thank you for the question. I think that the creation of this new Contact Committee is quite good, as we cannot stand close enough. Especially in a situation like the one we now have, we cannot stand too close in the Kingdom community, so there is every reason to do so. I had the opportunity to visit the Faroe Islands here a few weeks ago and found that the disagreement between Denmark and the Faroe Islands back in 2014 about restrictions on Russia has disappeared as dew for the sun, and that the Faroe Islands are taking the lead. I'm just gonna sign for that. I think it is exemplary when one considers the great dependence in the Faroese economy. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135931	Edmund Joensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135932	Thank you. Now the government and national government in the Faroe Islands and the national government in Greenland have an agreement on cooperation. Similarly, there are ideas that similar work should be done at parliamentary level. I would like that to be the way forward, that emphasis should be placed on this work. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135958	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405135958-2	I certainly do not disagree with that. I really think we need to know as much as possible about each other's foreign policy, defence policy, security policy interests in the Commonwealth, also because, in a situation like the one we are in now, they are perhaps clearer than they have been in the past.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140020	Sir. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140020-2	Thank you. We are, of course, very, very much in agreement that we need to phase out Russian gas. It is a huge opportunity to get rid of the use of some fossil energy. But with that, sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen says that it should be now, and we are very much in agreement with that, so we have to try to find out how and there are various proposals. Why don't you try to involve the people? How about trying to make it a folk case and give support to local folk mills, solar cells and heat pump communities, and in general develop these local energy communities that make many more Danes self-sufficient with energy? Then we are independent of the Russian gas and all other types of fossil energy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140056	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140059	I believe that some of the things that can be addressed are some of the arrangements that can be applied in today's world. There was one of them who closed here a few days ago, and who has been stormed by good people who want to replace their gas guy. I think we have to look at whether we can turn up these schemes and whether we can bring forward some of these schemes, so that this is something we are doing now. Because on the same occasion we hear that the people who have applied for these arrangements will receive answers sometime in the autumn. This needs to be given a higher priority, and it needs to be given now, both in relation to private customers, but also in relation to corporate customers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140131	Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140133	I am simply incredibly pleased that the Left would like to take part in looking at this without, of course, thinking that anything has been promised. We ourselves managed to get 20 million set aside. kr. of the Finance Act to local energy communities, that was before the war. That is not enough, of course, so thank you for perhaps wanting to discuss whether we can give it a huge boost so that we can get the Danes with a broad battle against Putin's gas and to secure us through local energy production, preferably throughout the country. There are some cities that have taken the lead, for example. Hvide Sande, which has some folk mills that work fantasticly well and provide nourishment to the city.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140204	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140206	We must and must look very unbiased at what we can do, both here and now and in the longer term. I certainly have no prejudice with me into the negotiating room, I would like to say that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140221	Sofie Carsten Nielsen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140222	Thank you so much for a really, really handsome and touching speech. I share all the feelings, but I also share the intention to become independent as soon as possible, and so I would like to ask a specific question. We in the Radical Left have presented a plan for how we will be independent as soon as possible. It also requires that we set a date to be 100%. free of gas and of course especially Russian gas in Denmark. That is possible, and I would therefore like to ask whether the President of the Left does not agree that it requires the advance of the agreements that we already have on energy islands and energy from offshore winds and land winds.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140304	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140306	I sincerely hope that we will be independent of Russian gas before we establish these energy islands, otherwise, frankly, it has a very long prospect. That is why I am also saying that we need to do something in the long term, but that we also need to do something in the very short term in the light of the crimes that we see. Frankly, I find it extremely difficult to defend this by saying that we are pouring some money back into this terrible war machine in return for getting some gas so that we can keep warm. Well, we have to do everything we can to get rid of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140341	Sofie Carsten Nielsen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140343	I fully agree with that, but if we do not make decisions within a very short period of time in order to bring these things forward, close the window, and then we will not be able to deliver, either on independence or on our climate targets. I therefore hope that we share the view that this should happen as soon as we get into the negotiating room.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140403	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140405	I am also looking forward to getting into the negotiating room and getting these things moving, and I really think that the speed was one of the things that I also stressed in my speech, in other words that this is something that is urgent for several reasons.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140420	Sir. Alex Vanopslagh, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140423	Thank you. Thank you from here, too, sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen for a good speech. The Left has been included in this national compromise, which is committed to spending up to 18 billion. kr. extra each year on the defense. That is a really wise expenditure to give priority to. I am, of course, sorry that the will to give priority to existing public expenditure, which is more than 1 200 billion. kr. It is not possible to finance it with deficits per year, it was not present and it is therefore planned to finance it with deficits. But everything has an end... that song Shu-bi-dua at least once... and at some point we also get a blue majority. So I really want to hear this: Mr Ellemann-Jensen's ambition that the money we have to find for defence, when there is a blue majority, are some we really find through reforms, rather than just running with deficits?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140501	Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140503	I would just like to make a correction: it is not up to 18 billion. kr. kr. Having said that, the national compromise is a compromise. And that means that there were wishes in the negotiating room, both that it should be financed through tax increases and that it should be financed through reforms. And now a compromise is made in such a way that all parties will have to give themselves a little. And I stand by the agreements that I contribute to making, especially an agreement on something as important as this. This does not mean that the reform agenda has been exhausted and that we do not have a fight against tax increases. We share that battle.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140541	Sir. Alex Vanopslagh, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140543	Yes, I fully agree that there is a compromise and that you stand by that. I don't really want to change that. But when there is a blue majority, because that day comes perhaps sooner than later, yes, then we still have to find the money for the defense. And that's where I'm gonna ask if it's sir. Mr Ellemann-Jensen's ambition is that we really should find the money and not just finance it with deficits. In case it's Mr. Knox. The ambition of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen to find the money through a deficit is a compromise with the Liberal Alliance and then find some of the money. But I really just want to hear what Mr. The ambition of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen in the long run when the majority changes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140612	Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140614	Well, that's that we're giving room to the reform agenda that both Mr. Alex Vanopslagh and I think is the right one and the important one and the responsible one. And if we want to prioritise something in the Community economy in Denmark, then we have to finance it, and we are through reforms. And in it lies also that we also have a desire in the community that it should not be more expensive to be a Dane, but also that people should be allowed to let go a little cheaper. And I think that the price increases that people are experiencing here and now are helping to put a thick line under it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140641	Mrs. Pernille Vermund, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140644	Thank you. A month ago, Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, to bind the Left to an agreement with the Social Democratic Party, with the Radical Left, with the Socialists in the SF. The three bourgeois parties with which the defence case is deeply concerned, DF, LA and New Citizens, chose the Left to ignore and keep outside the door, and it is a mystery to me how the President of the Left can expect me, with the mandates of New Citizens, to point to the President of the Left as future Prime Minister, when the President of the Left prefers to make an agreement with the Reds rather than with us. Is there an answer to that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140724	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140725	You can look around the hall here and there are 179 seats. The 90 of them should think that something is a good idea for it to happen. For me, the content of this national compromise is important. It's really, really important. For me, politics is about what we deal with and not who we deal with. This makes a difference to Denmark, and it's important to me.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140751	Pernille Vermund, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140752	But this was precisely an agreement that was reached without all parties, including three bourgeois parties, which hopefully have to point to a civil Prime Minister candidate, being involved in the negotiations that we had been held out of the door. And I actually think that Mr. Mr Ellemann-Jensen, rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen is the EU more important than bourgeois cooperation and a bourgeois Denmark. The Alliance with the Radical Left and the SF and the other red parties apparently means more to the Left than to solve the immigration policy from scratch together with DF and New Citizens. Isn't that the way it is?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140828	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140830	I think that's what journalistically called a sharp angle. No, it's not. Denmark's freedom, Denmark's security and peace in Denmark are more important to me than if I sit in that seat after the next parliamentary elections. That means everything to me, that's why I'm a member of this thing. It's about freedom, it's about Denmark, it's not about my personal ambitions. Then I hope that there will be a bourgeois majority pointing at me to sit in that seat, but it is not the case that I will say that I do not care about Denmark's freedom until then.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140904	Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140910	Thank you very much. First of all, thank you for your speech, but I would also like to thank you for the words you just made. I have to say that in a democracy it is just super important and especially in an uncertain situation that some security is being created. So we are certainly listening to that debate and supporting where we can. I also noticed that the rapporteur spoke about the Arctic when we were talking about defence. And I would like to give the opportunity that the rapporteur may be able to give some thought to what needs to be done in a future defence settlement with regard to the Arctic. And there's this one in particular, like sir. Edmund Joensen also asked about how to ensure the involvement of Greenland and the Faroe Islands, so it will be a good process for everyone.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140949	Here you go, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405140950	There is no doubt that Greenland's location is the reason why the kingdom is an Arctic nation. Our entire geostrategic interest in the Arctic, which we share as a kingdom community, well it comes from Greenland, and therefore Greenland must also be involved in this process. We also know, on the other hand, that this is a huge area of new shipping routes and so on, which we do not have the capacity to cover completely, and we never will, because so many ships cannot be produced. However, we need to be better at covering the whole Arctic area, and that is one of the things we bring to the conciliation negotiations.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141028	Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141030	Thank you very much. We share that in general, but we also want low-voltage in Greenland, and we also know that it is challenged with the situation there is. But that is why dialogue is also extremely important, that is, this close involvement. After all, we saw with the Arctic Capacity Package that it was a challenge to ensure that Greenland was involved, and we also have different political positions in Greenland. That is why I also think that this whole discussion about conciliation and putting aside some party colours in order to safeguard the interests of the country is something we also look at very much through Greenlandic glasses. But I'd like to know how to involve you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141106	Thank you. Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141108	I think it is important that we involve all parties to the Kingdom Community. I also have to say that I share the ambition that the Arctic should be a low-voltage area. The world just looks different. And a few months ago it was quite unthinkable for many of us to say anything other than that the Arctic is of course a low-voltage area, other things would be unthinkable. We're somewhere else today. We also need to take that into account when we talk about the defence settlement. I hope that is also the view expressed in Naalaksususut and in Inatsisartut.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141144	Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141147	Thanks for the speech. The party leader says that it wants greater involvement also to take place in North Atlantic cooperation in the Kingdom community. In some cases we have a democratic deficit when we look at the cooperation that exists between the parliaments we have in the Kingdom Community. Have the party leaders thought about how this might be strengthened? Among other things: Siumut has come up with a proposal for a Parliamentary Council where the various parliamentarians from parliaments other than the Folketing can also meet.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141224	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141225	Well, I do not know the specific proposal. It sounds like a good idea, because the more we look at each other, the better it is in reality. Fortunately, we now have a constitutional representation of both Greenland and the Faroe Islands in the Folketing, and if we are to talk about democratic surpluses or deficits, I believe that there is an over-representation of this kind in proportion. I think that is a good thing, I think it is important and I think it is right. But the more we know each other, the better we will be able to work together on common interests.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141258	Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141300	Now our mandates are, for example. the two members of Parliament from Greenland, based on the choice in 1953 that Greenland should become exactly like Denmark. But we have later found out that this was not really possible. Later on, we have had our own parliament and our own government, and that has also resulted in us, for example. has five parties in Greenland, but there are only two who are represented in the Danish Parliament, ergo there are some votes that are lost by this. I hope that we can work together with all the parties in this Parliament to strengthen cooperation, perhaps among other things. by inviting party leaders to a party leader debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141338	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141340	I just stand straight and count; I think there are 15 parties represented here and now in the Folketing, and I dread the upcoming election campaign where we will be a 52-53 pieces. In other words, I agree that it is good to have close cooperation and to have it between parliaments, I think, would be a strengthening for all of us. So I would very much like to see that open-minded.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141407	Well, then we'll thank Mr. Knox. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sir. Sikandar Siddique got in right here in the end. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141419	Yeah, I'm one of the new party leaders. Thank you for a very touching speech, a very sympathetic speech that brought my thoughts to our asylum system. What makes the Left think that the conditions in our asylum system are good enough for refugees from Africa and the Middle East, but are certainly not good enough for Ukrainians? In the Greens, we do not think that they are good enough for anyone. But what makes the Left think that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141454	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141456	It is that we believe that we have a special responsibility for our area of proximity. We believe that every country in the world has that. And there is a difference between refugees fleeing from countries that are geographically close to Denmark or not located near Denmark. That is something we should be against, but that is why we are looking at it that way. If only all the countries in the world took the same responsibility for their vicinity as Denmark does, then the world was a better place.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141520	Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141522	Of course, we disagree here. Has this whole situation of Ukrainian refugees caused the Left to reconsider its view of refugees, its view of the entire asylum system? Has this given rise to some reconsideration as to whether this is the right way to deal with our refugees?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141550	Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141552	I think that there are many things that give rise to such reflection. Our asylum system is one of them. The possibility of obtaining a work permit is another one. It has also been mentioned earlier that it becomes very clear when so many Ukrainians have come to Denmark, how incredibly much bureaucracy we wrap people into in this country, probably on the basis of good intentions. But the result is that people are affected by the public sector, and this is not always the best thing that can happen to a very rare actually. And we have to do something about that. We owe that to the people who have come here who want to enter the labour market. Employers stand and want to accept them; then we also owe it to them to get them through this mill, and this illustrates the situation that we are not doing well enough. Let's learn from that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141637	Thank you, sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. Now there are no more brief comments. We move on to Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405141651	Thank you. I would like to say a few words about impotence, about hope and about action. Until the other day I had not heard of Butja in Ukraine, but the pictures of only neatly covered mass graves, the many assassinated in the streets and houses have now forever inscribed Butja as one of the darkest chapters of modern European history. The city that I had not heard of until recently, and where people just a few weeks ago lived a quiet and peaceful life, has now entered the history books as one of the darkest places in European civilization since Srebrenica. We have no reason to believe that Putin's brutal and almost ruthless troops have not done and continue to do the same in many other places in Ukraine. Putin's brutality and war crimes are more than concrete. But it is also the actual manifestation of something more abstract by evil: the attack on the very idea of the moral structure that we thought existed in Europe. Civilization is a thin layer of fernis. The pictures we received the other day from Butja in Ukraine fill many of us with equal parts of horror and anger and impotence, for no matter how much desire one might have to send all the bombs of the world down on Putin, we also know that it is our politicians in the West did not let trigger World War III. That responsibility and burden rests on the leaders of the West, however heavy it may be to be unable to intervene more directly. It is said that hope is not a strategy, and it is true. Good behavior spares no one from the brutality of executioners and thugs. Hope for peace, disarmament and dialogue will spare no one once the war machines of world history are set in motion. Nevertheless, we need hope, and human history bears just as many examples of people who rise up and build up where others have overturned and destroyed. But hope also needs to be concrete; hope needs to be translated into action • action that takes us away from impotence, action that lifts us above the pious hope, action that lifts us forward and brings about a real change. It is therefore quite clear to me that what we have seen from Butja must have a very natural consequence. As Mr. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said earlier, we must and must shut down all imports of oil and gas from Russia immediately, with the costs and consequences that Europe will have to bear. We must share in solidarity between the EU and NATO countries the opportunities for securing housing and businesses energy. We can't go on like this. We must and must turn off the cash flows to Putin, even if we want to experience scarcity for a period of time. We need to get what Robert Habeck of the SF's sister party in Germany called the energy of freedom and that all renewable energy types get going. We must also accept a number of compromises for a few years, but we must get the energy of freedom going for Ukraine and for our own sake. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142011	There is a brief comment. Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142017	Thank you for another very, very nice speech from one of the parliamentary party leaders. I welcome how we are able to work together on these very, very difficult issues, and am also glad that it is said by the SF that from here the dilemmas are then queuing. And there's one thing I'd like to ask you about. One of the reasons why we have not yet been able to get as much renewable energy as we really want is that there are often very long application periods, there can be redress and there may be different environmental considerations, and so far I have recognised it all, but if we are going to produce much more renewable energy, does SF recognise that we might also come into some dilemmas there?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142056	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142058	I have no doubt that we will discuss this. Because if we want to set up land wind; if we want to set up more wind at sea; if we want to make more biogas, to mention examples of some of what we need, or for that matter more solar cells, we will also discuss the processing time. Therefore, it has actually been quite important for the SF to look at whether we can get it through the systems even more quickly and have some bureaucracy abolished. However, I would still like to say that it is important for us to involve local people in these consultation processes. We can make it faster, more flexible, we are willing to do so, but we must also have some balances in it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142130	Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142132	Well, I agree with that. Balances are important, and local involvement, as was also said by the Alternative before, is also extremely important. However, I believe that whatever our support for the balances and we would like to have all the words in it, it will eventually end up on our table. If we want much more renewable energy in Europe, if we really want to free ourselves from Russian gas, then we must build so much solar energy, so much land wind and so much sea wind in such a short period that we will surely compromise on several different things. And there I just hope that our desire to get out of the Russian gas goes all the way, even when we are about to make the awkward decisions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142210	Pia Olsen Dyhr, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142213	Now, since the 1970s, the SF has actually stood on the side of investing in renewable energy, and has also been aware that it is not only about the climate, it is also about the environment, it is also about security policy, and we have actually forgotten that little in the discussion in Denmark. That is why, of course, we are ready to give it full gas and also look at the green energy. As I said, it is freedom energy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142233	Then it's mr. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142236	Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr says that her party has been on this agenda since the 1970s, that is. Fifty years. Today we are where 34 per cent. of the Danish energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources, which means that if it is to be the same frequency in the future, it will take 100 years before we reach 100 per cent. In the European Union, it is even worse that we are down to 3%. of energy consumption coming from renewable energy sources. How long does Mrs Pia Olsen have to wait for the green transition while Putin fills her pockets from Europe?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142304	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142306	I don't have time. I think we should do it now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142310	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142312	Does Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr not at all recognise that it is to put the voters in the eye to say that, on just what is like a short or medium track through the green transition, it can prevent the gas purchase from Putin and that, of course, it is quite other things that need to be installed on the short track, among other things. gas from the United States, more from our own resources, etc., while at the same time we look at the longer track to ensure the green transition? The time alone to build a offshore wind farm takes longer than we can tolerate Putin sitting in the Kremlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142340	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142342	I do not disagree at all with that, for example. will take time to install the energy islands, it will take time to install more solar cells and for that matter also to do it with landwind. But the point is, we don't have to use this as an excuse for importing other black gas, and that's the one from the Americans. In fact, we will then have to build large ports and it will actually take time. But first of all, we are not dependent on Russian oil in Denmark, the last reports say, so there we are at least one step ahead. Then what can we look at with the gas? That's where we can look at biogas. We are willing to do so in the SF, but there we have stood quite alone with the Left, and we would still like to do so by a greater majority.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142420	Sir. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142427	This is a situation where we all have our hands on the hot plate. How are we going to replace the Russian gas? Biogas is an idea, but it's not enough. There are many things we need to do and we need to do it quickly; more party leaders are saying now. What does Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr think about this involving the population to a greater extent in local heat pumps, local folk mills, local solar communities, so to try to involve people widely in the development of energy, which enables us to withstand the black gas from Russia with green, Danish local energy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142456	Here you go, Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142458	I am open to looking at everything, and I really want to say that some of what we have been able to see put turbo on the green transition, especially in the 1980s on land winds, has been the popular stock. I do not think that is enough in relation to the level of energy we need, but it is also a good supplement, I agree with the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142514	Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142516	My second question is on Lynetteholmen. This is how the budget is running out and the funding looks a little special. A new minister has now arrived in this area, and we have asked the minister whether he will guarantee that it is self-financing, in that it is what he has been sold on that it is self-financing. I find it difficult to get the Minister to guarantee it any longer. Will SF's party leader guarantee that Lynetteholmen will be self-financing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142543	Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142545	I do not think I should take over the role of the Minister. It is the Minister of Transport who has to answer that question. What is crucial for SF is that we get climate protection from Copenhagen. That's the idea in Lynetteholmen. We are also concerned that the construction of Lynetteholmen takes place on really sensible principles in terms of sustainability in our common sea. It is about ensuring that there is not so much flapping in Køge Bay, among other things, and that we provide pillar curtains and other things to create the necessary air in Køge Bay. So I am preoccupied with the fact that we are also making the investments that are going to be made for environmental purposes, and that is why I cannot say whether, in the end, it will not cost any money, because I really think that sustainability must cost money.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142624	Mai Villadsen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142627	Thank you, and thank you for a very, very good speech once again. I will continue a little along the same lines as the alternative, because there was another violent climate report yesterday, it has to be said. It sprouted hope, but it also said that we are even more busy than ever; that our budgets are being used up. That is why I am concerned that we in Denmark are going to make such major mega projects, which also emit a lot of CO2 Exactly Lynetteholmen has been complained of by the Climate Movement in Denmark because it is so big a CO2
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142709	Pia Olsen Dyhr, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142711	I would say that our challenge in relation to the climate is a little, that every time we make an infrastructure project, whatever it may be, in the future too, there will be a CO2 that will be in the energy islands in the short run, but it will produce renewable energy in the long run, and that is the kind of accounting we have to make up. I am also concerned that we are continuing to build trains and public transport in Denmark, although this will create a climate impact. Lynetteholmen is specifically about climate protection in Copenhagen. There I am concerned that it should be environmentally sensible, and that will probably also mean that we will have a CO2
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142745	Mai Villadsen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142746	It is absolutely true that for all construction projects there will be CO 2 Et is Lynetteholmen, something else is the Kattegat connection, which we can see into very soon, and there I would like to hear whether SF really thinks that a new four-track motorway over such a fantastic nature that will derive so much CO 2
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142819	Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142824	Now we await the report on the Kattegat Bridge. The Ministry of Transport is making it. It is because we want to look at the climate, we want to look at the environment, we want to look at nature and we also want to look at the economy, and I can have my doubts about how to deal with this. My concern is nature on Røsnæs. My concern is with Samsø and whether it is environmentally sound, but I am also so prepared that I would actually like some facts to base our decision-making on, so I await the report, but I would say that I am not uncritical in relation to the report that is coming.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142854	Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142857	Thank you. And thank you for a good speech. Now we heard before that Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr is not Minister for Transport, but I read in the paper that Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr wants to be Minister for Finance, and if you do, you have to take care of taxpayers' money, you have to ensure that the money fits and you have to conduct a responsible economic policy, otherwise you will not be doing so for very long. So I would just like to ask Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr to confirm that a key condition for us to be able to afford welfare and that we can afford a green transition in the future is that the retirement age of Danes increases while our life expectancy increases.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142930	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405142932	I do not necessarily share that view. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen i. When you look at the opportunities that are in Danish economy despite the hammock effect, which is in 2030-2032, there will be some air in Danish economy for example. to ask whether the Danes necessarily have to work until they are 90 years old. I think that is actually going to be a very important discussion, and it is also an important fundamental discussion about when to be allowed to retire. I am not saying that we should all retire when we are 50 or 55 years old, but I think that the automatic increase in retirement age is a challenge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143011	Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143012	I can hear from the answer that the limit goes at 90 years, and that is after all to move some way. Can Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr then confirm that the prerequisite for a strong economy and for us to be able to afford things we would like to, if it is not an increasing retirement age, is that we continue to implement reforms in Danish society?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143034	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143036	I certainly can. We are not reluctant to look at reforms, and one of the things we would like to look at is some of the many part-time workers we have in our public sector, for example. be educators, educational assistants and nurses, as we would like to lift from part-time to full-time. In fact, it is also a reform. Reforms do not always have to be unsolidarative or turn the heavy end down, such as: if you want to make top tax concessions or reduce benefits. Reforms can be many things, so I am not opposed to that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143107	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143111	Thank you. Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr has said that neither the rising prices nor the strengthening of defence nor the cost of Ukrainian refugees must cost on welfare. Well, that's easy to say, but then it's gotta cost somewhere else. And that makes me wonder again where the folk socialists or socialists think the money comes from. Can Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr tell me where socialists think the money for welfare comes from when spent on something else?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143137	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143139	I am simply not sure that I understand Mrs Pernille Vermund's question, because I hear Mrs Pernille Vermund over and over again saying that we can just fire it is 10,000 or 100,000 in the public sector? That means it's the nurse, the police officer, the soldier or whoever we're gonna fire in the public sector, and then we're all gonna get richer. I mean, it creates a poorer society. I believe that welfare is the prerequisite for our having a strong private sector. If what Pernille Vermund is asking me is whether we still need a private sector, then the answer is yes. I don't think I've ever been against the private sector, but I just didn't understand the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143214	Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143216	I'll try again. If you spend money on welfare, if you spend money on Ukrainian refugees, and if you spend money on strengthening the defense, then more things at once • where will that money come from? So, Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr says that it must not go beyond welfare that we strengthen the defence. The welfare of Ukrainian refugees must not be affected. Where will the money come from if it is not to go beyond welfare?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143244	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143246	That is why it is so good that the Danish economy is as robust and solid as it has been. Among other things, it has. SF has taken financial responsibility for many years and helped ensure that there is room for manoeuvre in the Danish economy. That is what Mrs Pernille Vermund would know if she had read the agreement we made at the Prime Minister's Office. It is true that we are going to make a deficit on public finances, but of course not in the long run, because already in 2035 there is a surplus on public finances because of the room for manoeuvre we have created.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143318	Thank you. Then it's mr. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143320	Thank you. And thank you for your speech. I agreed with the vast majority as I heard it. I'd like to follow up on what I also asked the Prime Minister about. Now we have many Ukrainians coming here; we want them to work quickly; there is a certain bureaucracy to get them to work. When a few weeks ago an agreement was negotiated here among some parties on foreign labour, I thought it was a little more foot-timing and the bureaucracy was not so busy getting rid of it. But will the SF be ready, when it comes to Ukrainians, that we get something done about it, that we get work permits out quickly, that we get people to come out and become self-supporting as soon as possible?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143356	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143358	Yes, and I don't think there's any reason why people are being transported from West Jutland to Næstved, because they need biometrics or whatever it is. Let's just get this done quickly and smoothly. Let's get the Ukrainians to work. The SF is certainly willing to do that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143412	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143414	I am extremely pleased about that. Then I hope that we can jointly put pressure on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure that this is done quickly and that the residence permits come in. I am very pleased that, in relation to the foot-timing approach that I felt there was in the previous negotiations, because you also have a Danish trade union movement that sees ghosts everywhere, as soon as a foreigner enters to work, here is ready to give Ukrainians the opportunity to get to work quickly. So thank you for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143438	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143440	Now I hope that Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen is aware that the discussion we had in the Ministry of Finance was not only about Ukrainians, but generally about opening up the Danish labour market. And what I and SF are concerned with in this regard is, of course, proper pay and working conditions. There should be no doubt about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143454	Thank you. Then it's mr. Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143456	Thank you, and thank you for a very good speech. I would like to ask the implications of the policy pursued by the government, the SF and the majority in Denmark during this parliamentary term, where inequality in Denmark has increased as a result of the various taxes and charges that have been introduced. And even if the tobacco tax is abolished, inequality has continued to increase, because taxes hit the poorest in Denmark the hardest. So I just want to hear something from Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr: how do the Danes feel during this parliamentary term that Denmark has become a worse country as a result of the government's inequality-building policy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143531	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143532	I think it is a problem that inequality has increased. There should be no doubt about that. And that is why it is good that we are already in the Ministry of Employment and are negotiating a new system of benefits, because I am concerned that those who are poorest in Denmark receive better treatment than they do today. I don't think children should grow up in poverty. Having said that, I would also like to say that some of the things that create increased inequality, for example. is that we have abolished partner income dependency, something SF is very proud to be involved in, because that means that partners to people on early retirement can work something. I thought the Liberal Alliance might have an interest in that too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143603	Sir. Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143605	I fully agree with Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr that sometimes there are things to be done, even if it increases inequality because it is good for society. But inequality has increased during this parliamentary term, and I know that inequality is very close to SF, so the question is actually quite simple: how can the Danes feel the increasing inequality in this parliamentary term, how has life deteriorated for Danes as a result of the increasing inequality that has occurred over the last few years? That is really just what I would like an answer to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143628	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143630	I think that Mr. Alex Vanopslagh is really going to meet one of the families that the Neighbors look up every day on Facebook. They can feel that their services are small, and that is really the challenge in Denmark that there is great inequality. That is why we are currently fighting for a better system of benefits, and we are going to fight hard for this, because we do not think that the poorest Danes should be able to feel that they should now have more money out of their pockets, for example. to provide proper heat at home or to get food and other things. And they can really feel that there is increasing inequality.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143702	Thank you. Then it's mr. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143704	Thank you for the floor. And thank you to Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr for a good speech. In addition to this inequality, there is also another inequality which is increasing, precisely democratic inequality. We now have 440,000 people in Denmark who live here and work here but who cannot vote because they do not have the right to vote. And we could read the other day that 1 in 10 children born in Denmark and I know that the rapporteur is concerned about the welfare of children and does not have Danish citizenship. So this group is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. What will SF and Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr do to eliminate this democratic inequality?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143743	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143745	We have, of course, together with the Radical Left, the Enhedslisten, the Alternative and perhaps the Free Greens, put forward a proposal that children born and raised in Denmark, who have no spots on the criminal record, etc., should be able to obtain automatic citizenship when they are 18 years old. And that's what we still think they should have.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143801	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143804	We absolutely support this in the Greens. But then this part is also with the adults. So, 440,000 adult people I think it's one in five Copenhageners you meet on the street... don't have a Danish citizenship. And there is no one who comes here on a tourist visa; so there are some who live here, work here and live here. This group is getting bigger and bigger, and I am afraid that at some point, if we make a projection, we have a team A and a team B, that is, some people who sit and control, and then a huge group who live in democracy but who are spectators of democracy. What's the SF gonna do about that part?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143840	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143842	First of all, I hope that they will vote in local elections. I think that is important; we should use the right to vote that we now have. But if they are to have the right to vote in national elections, they must apply for citizenship, and we must, of course, allow them to apply for citizenship. I also think that we have looked at some of the things about the fact that it is difficult to obtain citizenship if you have been fined for burning your hedge, because I think it is a little crazy that we have ended up there. But I would also like to say that there is a reason why we have some rules in relation to citizenship, in other words that it is a challenge to get Danish citizenship, because it is also something special to get Danish citizenship.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143914	Thank you. And there are no more brief comments. Thank you to Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr. And then it's the next party leader from the Radical Left. Here you go, Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405143929	Thank you. I think we all agree that Butja is impotence and horror, and I can feel a heartfelt desire from all of us to hold war criminals to account. But if we are to maintain hope, as Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr also mentioned, then action must also be taken. Last Question Time I asked the Prime Minister if she agreed that we should bring forward the expansion of renewable energy so that we can be freed more quickly from Russian gas, which we are also debating today. And I asked the Prime Minister if there was no need for a rapid and concrete phasing-out plan. And she replied that she was in complete agreement. However, since the war broke out, we have not yet taken the decisions on climate and energy that will really make a difference. That is why I am very pleased that Mrs Mette Frederiksen has today given her promise of action after Easter. That's good news. We have not yet taken decisions that will specifically accelerate the green transition and make Denmark and Europe independent of fossil fuels. And I think it is crystal clear to everyone now that energy policy is a security policy. We know the answers to the challenges; we also have the solutions. The answer is to advance the concrete energy and climate projects now. These are concrete here-and-now investments in energy islands and in wind and solar energy at sea and on land, because with these answers we can ensure a green future, a green freedom for Denmark and Europe. In the Radical Left, we presented a plan on 5 March with a response bid and also a response to funding. And that was a month ago. So I would just like to appeal to all of us to get out of this now, because if we make the decisions now, we can just as an example reduce our total fossil gas consumption by 50%. by 2025, and we can completely get rid of it by 100%. in 2028. So we can give Danish climate solutions the European wingspan, as Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen also talked about which goes far beyond our own national borders. So it is not a question of whether and it was also underlined by the IPCC report that came yesterday. We all want peace; we want freedom; we want a fossil-free future, but here we actually have the opportunity now to be the Parliament which carries out the historical energy and climate actions. We can't just shut down the gas tomorrow, but we can't just wait.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144244	Thank you. And the first brief remark is from Mrs Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144249	Thank you. The views of the Radical Left on majority decisions in foreign and security policy in the European Union have been somewhat unclear in the media. Today, of course, unanimity is required, but the Treaty allows for majority voting. Will the Radical Left support a transition to majority voting in this area?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144313	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144315	Not for now. It may well be that when we look into a European project in 20 years' time, we will ask: what do we need? However, what we have to vote on, namely whether we want to abolish the reserve to be part of the European Union's defence and security policy, is an intergovernmental cooperation in which each country has a right of veto. It will be here in the Folketing that we must decide it every time it is relevant. And we support that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144343	Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144345	Maybe in 20 years, says Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen. I would really like a clear answer, not for my own sake, but for the sake of the Danes. In other words, can we be sure forever that we have a right of veto in this area, or do we want the Radical Left, if we have first given our right to have this reservation, to remove that right of veto?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144411	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144413	No, the Radical Left does not want that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144416	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144422	I am very, very pleased with the words of the radical leader about the need to free us from Russian gas. It is also an important part of the national compromise. We agree that there is a need for major climate ambitions and also for these decisions to be urgent. They do so at Danish level, and they do so at European level. These are also very complicated decisions to make. It sounds easy, but of course it's incredibly complicated. One of the things that we can see at least will have to deal with in such a dilemma is that the large expansions of renewable energy are often delayed due to very long processing times, complaints and environmental considerations. Does the Radical Left recognise that there are some dilemmas here that we are going to have to deal with?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144505	Thank you. Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144507	We very much acknowledge this in the Radical Left, and I have to say that we are also ready to go into these dilemmas. We need to move fast here. This applies to our climate projection... the IPCC gave us a few years yesterday to solve this task... and, in addition, there is war in Europe. So it must be now that all of us, I think, also with the support of the people, can see that it cannot be done in bureaucracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144538	Thank you. There are no follow-up brief remarks, so now it is Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144543	I think it is very positive about the helpfulness and willingness that the Danes are showing to the Ukrainians and Ukrainian refugees who are coming to Denmark right now. But in the long term it will also burden the Danish economy, and we can already see that the war does so in relation to the Danes' economy in general. There are also some Danes who are particularly vulnerable and who are particularly badly affected, some of whom have the least, and I would like to know what reflections the Leader of the Radicals is doing about it and how we can help them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144616	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144618	It is quite true that rising prices for everyone are now hitting very hard, and that is where we need to look into, even in the longer term, whether there are places we need to lighten it. It could be the electricity tax, which we have already relieved once, and that will benefit a great many people. But it must go hand in hand with the green conversion, so that it will be a subsidy to get over to a cheaper and therefore green heat source. We must do everything in our power to help with this and also to do even more than we are doing now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144650	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144652	I believe that the SF and the Radical Left fully agree with the urgency of the green transition. At the same time, I am also concerned about what we do with the most vulnerable in Denmark, some of those who have the very least money, i.e. the elderly who have nothing but their national pension, the families, families with children who are on cash benefits. Could the Radical Left perhaps see, like the SF, that we could do something special in relation to them? And I'm not talking about compensating everyone, but I think so much to target the compensation. What would the Radical Left say about that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144721	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144723	Well, now we've actually agreed to reluctantly, we have to say this heat check, because we don't want to support even more gas consumption, but, on the other hand, we just see that there are groups that need help here and now, and we are always willing to do that in the Radical Left. So the important thing is that it will be in a sustainable way, something that can hold up, even further in the future, and that we will not support with one hand an additional fossil consumption or elements that cannot be corrected again, but that with the other hand we will of course help those who are most at risk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144757	Thank you. Then it's mr. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144759	Thank you. I've been a member of the Folketing for almost seven years, but there's one thing I haven't tried before. This is the fact that there is a circle of agreements which makes an agreement on financing, where afterward you will no longer guarantee that it will be so. That is what is happening to Lynetteholmen at the moment. Well, Lynetteholmen was among other things. of the Radicals sold on and it was guaranteed that the project was self-financing. So, of course, all parties behind that agreement have their hands on the hot plate to say that this is self-financing. Can I have the radical leader say that she guarantees that Lynetteholmen is self-financing and drives around by herself?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144840	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144841	I'm not giving guarantees for something that's not on my desk. But it is clear that it will be extremely important to follow that project very, very closely. I'm personally extremely concerned about this clap in the bay of Køge, that is to say we'll get another solution to it. And in relation to the entire large Lynetteholm project, which is an extremely long-term project, it is interesting to delve into the elements, and of course also into the funding.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144908	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144910	But the parties behind the agreement have sold it because it is self-financing. Well, the previous Minister of Transport would barely talk to B.T. if they didn't confirm it was self-financing. Everyone has to confirm that it is self-financing. But will the parties behind the agreement not confirm what the parties promised when they sold the entire Lynetteholm project, namely that it will be self-financing when selling land?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144940	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144942	I cannot explain that here. I have not issued any guarantees, but it is quite obvious that it must be investigated and investigated, and the Minister must explain how matters are now connected.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144956	Thank you. Then it's mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405144958	Thank you. The other day I read in Berlingske that Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen would not refuse to raise the tax for the Danes in order to finance the refugees from Ukraine who are coming to Denmark. I guess it's on a backdrop that the government has raised taxes 42 times for just under 11 billion. kr. Does Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen really think that I am giving such an opportunity to express a disclaimer here that taxes should increase further for some of the most heavily taxed people in the world, namely the Danes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145034	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145036	The second worst thing that could happen to the Radical Left was that we raised taxes. The worst thing that could happen to the Radical Left was that we undermined development aid. That's how you have to understand that article.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145048	Sir. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145050	In other words, Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen sees all other sources of financing than development aid as more advantageous than raising taxes. That will reassure me a great deal. That's what I heard in the answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145106	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145107	Virtually all other funding options. Now I do not want to be hung up on any funding option, as Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen proposes, but it is correctly understood that I also listed up in the interview if you wanted to read all the details that there are a number of other options I would rather see. It was to put it at the forefront, how important and I cannot stress that it is to the Radical Left that the recipients of development aid, in other words the hardest hit in the world, should not have to pay any further, because it will ultimately harm ourselves and lead to further flows of refugees.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145144	Thank you. Then it's mr. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145147	Thank you for the floor, and thank you for a good speech. The Radical Left is, after all, helping to drop the budget law for this national compromise. Will the Radical Left also be involved in dropping the budget law for climate change and in combating inequality?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145205	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145207	It is not true that we are helping to drop the budget law. What is happening is that you go to the edge by lowering the deficit limit to 1%. in order to finance the defence agreement 10 years ahead. In the Radical Left, we are quite concerned that we will have a slightly more flexible budget law, but we are not concerned with annulling the budget law. It has helped to secure a responsible economy in Denmark for a number of years, and we will continue to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145241	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145243	Will the Radical Left help to do what the Radical Left has now done here when it comes to inequality and when it comes to climate change? Then I'll ask you that way. The second question I want to ask is about the climate. It's great to hear the enthusiasm of the Radical Left, but what does it mean in practice? Does that mean, for example, that you have to... In agreement with the EBCT's conclusions, we say: OK, we need to look at agriculture again, animal production must be part of the welfare agreement; we are dropping the infrastructure agreement because we do not want more motorways and more cement? Does this mean that the North Sea Agreement will be suspended, etc.? What does that mean in practice?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145317	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145319	This means in practice that we have presented a plan where we can reach 110%. reductions, which means that we can help the rest of Europe and the world to reduce too. We have also financed our plan. We have, for example. a bid to finance a green fund so that we could really move on to this right now. In practice, this means that we are prepared to help move 90 seats forward in the Folketing every time we can. Even if it requires the opening of agreements, we would be happy to do so. We're not outside, we're interested in moving forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145352	Thank you. Then it's mr. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145354	I noted that the rapporteur indicated to Mrs Pernille Vermund that majority decisions in defence policy in the European Union were something that could perhaps be imagined in 20 years' time. In other words, it is not a question of imagining it; it is a question of time, that is when you can imagine it. I would just like to ask Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen to confirm that such an amendment to the EU Treaty abolishing the right of veto and then moving to the majority voting model that she imagines is something that can be implemented without a referendum.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145428	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145430	There are many things that can do that. We could also abolish the defence reserve without a referendum if we wanted to, but we do not.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145437	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145439	Yeah, but that's not what I asked. What I was asking was that when you move from veto to qualified majority, it is not a question of sovereignty in the sense of the constitution, and that is why you do not hold a referendum. as when the Radical Left, 14 years ago, voted through the Lisbon Treaty. After all, the right of veto was abolished in 19 areas without asking the public. So squarely, I would just like the rapporteur to confirm that this can be done without a referendum.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145508	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145510	I am aware that it is quite square, and I also think I replied quite squarely, that one can do that. We are abolishing, for example. not the defence reserve without a vote. But you could choose to do that if you got there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145521	Thank you. Then it's mr. Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145524	Thank you. I came to think yesterday of an old joke that says that if you want to starve a radical, you just have to put the radical in front of a buffet, because they do not know what to choose. I was thinking of this because I saw this radical announcement that we are willing to raise taxes de facto, that is to say to freeze the income limits for taxes, which means, de facto, lowering the top tax limit and thus increasing the top tax. And it is no more than a few weeks ago that we almost together fought to lower the top tax, increasing the top tax limit. So I've actually just gone and gotten quite, quite confused. Well, what is it that Radicals want? Is it that there are fewer people who have to pay top tax, or are there more who have to pay top tax?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145603	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145605	I think I replied quite clearly to Mr. Knox. The same question by Mr Ellemann-Jensen. Clearly, it is a radical wish that fewer people should pay top tax, because it would mean that more people would put more hours into more craftsmen, more nurses, more of the people we need so much in the workforce. But when I gave that interview to Berlingske, it is because it is extremely important for the Radical Left that we do not undermine development aid and thus abandon the poorest in the world because it will ultimately harm ourselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145637	Sir. Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145638	Yes, that is in relation to the discussion on what we are doing in relation to the temporary increase in expenditure on Ukrainian refugees. But it's temporary expenses. When we had temporary expenses during the corona crisis, we didn't raise taxes. We can do something temporarily. So what on earth can cause a party like Radical Left to drop the ambition of lower taxes because of some temporary I find it hard to understand logic. Why should taxes be increased permanently when there is a temporary increase in expenditure for a short period of time?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145705	Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145707	They shouldn't. And it is still the radical Left's ambition to ease the tax. We have just done so in a reform agreement. We want to do so again when it makes sense. It was an illustration of how extremely important it is for the Radical Left that we should not undermine development aid and that was an illustration of how extremely far we are willing to go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145734	Then it's Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145739	Thanks for a nice green speech and a really nice green play recently. I want to ask you something else entirely. Like Enhedslisten, the Radical Left also believes that qualified majority voting should be introduced in order to send people to war, sending Danes to war, because these are some of the most serious decisions that can be made. If the defence reserve is abolished, it will mean that a simple majority in the Folketing can send Danes to various EU missions. Does the Radical Left still argue that there should, in fact, ideally be a qualified majority, i.e. a two-thirds majority, to send people off?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145817	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145819	We are in favour of abolishing this defence reserve so that we can be involved in the missions that we in the Folketing seem to make sense. It is not to enter a war, it is to defend Europe. These are the missions which make sense and which we will be able to support, and that is why I do not think there is any reason to change that relationship in it. However, I fully agree with the rapporteur that if Denmark itself sends soldiers to war, that is to say bilaterally, there must be a two-thirds majority.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145854	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145856	Okay, so I have to understand that in the eyes of the Radicals there is a difference between the different kinds of missions. Then I would just like to know if these are all the missions that the European Union has sent personnel to Mali, the Central African Republic. Have they been looked at radically and thought: we support them, we think this is a good idea, and we should send Danes to them in the long term too?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145919	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145921	It is not the case that there is an automatism for the Radical Left, and that is also why I say it makes good sense to stand firm that it is, of course, the Folketing that approves it every time. It is a bilateral cooperation, and every time Danish soldiers are sent in missions, it is of course the Folketing that approves it. Yes, we think the missions mentioned make sense. It makes good sense that the European Union is also active on the African continent and is helping to do this, otherwise other powers are less democratically designed to take over.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405145955	Thank you. And thank you to the radical party leader. The next party leader is Mrs. Mai Villadsen from the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150020	The green transition is the most important political task that our generation has. That cannot be said often or clearly enough. At the moment, we all see fearful, angry and appalled at the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at Butja, developments in the war, peace negotiations, and we see the reactions of the countries around us. The war is outrageous and, at the same time, it underlines the need for a green transformation of our society and of the whole world. In the Enhedslisten, we have been advocating climate action and a sustainable society that is completely independent of fossil energy, both because that is exactly what the world is crying out for, but also, of course, because that is what makes us independent of all dictatorships and rogue states in the world. We have long been laughed at and called climate freaks and eco-hippies, and our vision of an entirely green society has been mocked and called absurd, and that is extremely tragic, because now we are in common with the bill of a Danish society and a Europe that is made dependent on oil, coal and gas, which both destroys the globe and finances Putin's war machine. It's a huge giant political failure, actually. The Russian invasion of Ukraine reminds us in all its horror that the green transition is a global geopolitical cardinal point. Now is the time to throw everything we have into our hands and make a planned and all-embracing green transformation of society. Zelenskyi spoke to the Folketing last week and his message was clear: Drop the oil and coal from Russia. I think we should do that right away. We need to speed up the installation of solar cells and wind turbines, strengthen the electricity grid, allow large polluting companies to pay, restructure agriculture and stop several of the polluting mega projects that emit tons of CO2 For the climate crisis is creating wars, crises, huge inequality and climate refugees in millions. That is why we need to send more climate aid, and that is why we should not cut our development aid, and that is why we must make the world's most ambitious green conversion so that the poorest do not pay the price yet again. This is the way to make us independent of the world's worst states. That is the way to peace and freedom. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150305	Thank you for that, and the first brief remark is from Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150309	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. We are all looking at the atrocities that are happening in Ukraine at the moment, and I think that if there was one thing the Ukrainians could want, it was that they were members of NATO. I have become increasingly unclear about exactly what the Enhedslisten thinks about NATO. I understood that you don't want to be a member of it, but you don't want to get out of it right now. What does the rapporteur really mean and recognise that, if we were not members of NATO, we would have a reason to sleep extremely uneasy these days?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150343	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150345	At any rate, I recognise that the situation had been different, Ukraine had been a member of NATO, and that is why what is going on right now, and what we must look at, is also so awful, and I am glad that we have done so much, yes, sent everything from arms to emergency aid. In the Enhedslisten, we would like to see a different security structure in Europe and in the world, based more on some of the other structures that already exist, the United Nations, a reformed United Nations, Nordic defence cooperation and others that are not seeking armament, but the opposite.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150420	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150421	I think that is an extremely beautiful thought that I can never see through in the world. So, does Mrs Mai Villadsen imagine that Putin is thinking that we need a new approach to security and strategy? When we come to the end of the day, what is the alternative to NATO in reality? There is no alternative if we want to live in peace and freedom. I just want the Enhedslisten to deal with that. There is a great deal to be desired in the world, but does the rapporteur think Putin is thinking that we should go there with Enhedslisten and have a new understanding of security in the world?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150459	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150500	God, I'm not gonna make me smart. But there is no doubt that the alternatives are not there right now, and that is also why we stand as we do. But I also do not understand that there are no other parties that have visions that we should go somewhere else. For what NATO stands for is an arms spiral of 2%. For all eternity, and I can hear parties in this Danish Parliament not being dismissive of some NATO countries putting nuclear weapons on Danish soil. That's what worries me, even when I go to sleep at night.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150535	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150537	I very much agree with the words of the Conservative leader here on the issue of NATO. I really want to ask you something else. Now that we are faced with the situation that we, across the parties in the Folketing, agree to help the Ukrainian refugees who come to Denmark at a time when, fortunately, we do not have any unemployment, and therefore do not have any unemployed employees in our welfare society, whom we can hire to take on that task, is it not good that we also get a very, very clear signal from a collective parliament that it will also come with a price, that it will be felt in our welfare society, and that we will need everyone to be really flexible and make an extraordinary effort in this extraordinary situation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150622	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150623	Well, if 20,000, 50,000 or 100,000 Ukrainian refugees come to our country, it's almost going to affect every school class, every single birthplace it's going to affect our entire welfare. We can't just blindly close our eyes to that. And it's true that there's a lack of hands out there. So that's something we're all going to have to take stock of, especially here in this Parliament hall. There is no doubt about that. I myself spoke a few weeks ago to family members and retired teachers, who I think were ready to engage in some of the work, and that must be the case. I am sorry that once again it is the welfare that has to stand up for, but we need to find solutions together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150700	Thank you. Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150702	Thank you for that statement. I think it is important to say that it is not the case that welfare is the main thing that is going to stand up for. We are all going to be able to feel it here, whether it is through rising energy prices, inflation or the price of petrol, if you are going to do your job and need to drive. It is clear that with both a war on its own continent and a very, very large flow of refugees, it will have very direct consequences. And what becomes everyone's dilemma is that we cannot pay our way out of this when we look at our welfare and the welfare offers that apply to the Danes. That is why we are also faced with some very difficult dilemmas. I take Mrs May Villadsen's words as an expression of its recognition of the Enhedslisten already now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150749	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150750	In the Enhedslisten we can clearly see the dilemmas. There's a pressure coming on all of us. It's on welfare, private, in the economy and on the wallet. After all, we in the Danish Parliament must do everything we can to make it as mild as possible, but it will be hard. Something I am really happy about is that Parliament has chosen to say: we are helping these Ukrainians to get to work as quickly as possible, get the children into primary school, or at least into the education system, and become part of society. I think that is the wisest thing to do for all refugees.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150822	Then it's Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150825	I took note of Mrs Mai Villadsen's reply to Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen had a lot of focus on American a-weapons on Danish soil. The SF is against this too, but I do not think it is the greatest security threat we face. I think that the greatest security threat to Denmark is in fact Putin and Russia's aggression. I would just like to know whether Mrs Mai Villadsen agrees with that. And when we look into that picture, what are we supposed to do about it? If we are not to be part of NATO, should we defend ourselves in Denmark, or what defence and security policy does Enhedslisten see defending Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150857	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150858	The cult is the great threat to peace in the West, in Europe. I do not think that I can only guess or take the words of the Defense Intelligence Service that it is Denmark that lies first in Putin's dreams; it is the Baltic countries or the old Soviet Union. That is of course extremely worrying, and I also think that we should be concerned about China and many other threats. There is no doubt about that, but it does not change the fact that we in the Enhedslist, unlike others, are working for disarmament and peace, and we think that we are essential to stick to that, even if there are aggressors out there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150939	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405150940	I also think it can be said that the SF wants peace in the world. In fact, I believe that every party in here wants peace in the world. The point is just whether you think it's happening by giving our soldiers flowers in the guns, or whether you believe that when someone shoots at us, we have to be ready to defend ourselves. I would really like to and I would appreciate it very much if I had an answer to my question: what is it that should defend Denmark? What is it? I've heard from Enhedslisten saying a Nordic cooperation. Sweden and Finland are entering NATO and have major discussions about it. I do not imagine Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia joining NATO into Baltic Sea cooperation. So what is it right now and here that you don't dream of defending Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151018	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151020	I also think it is a little harshly said that Enhedslisten just wants to go and put flowers in the guns. That is not our policy. Our policy is that we must strive for something else. We do not want Denmark to leave NATO today or tomorrow, as I have repeated a great many times, but we believe that we must work politically to reform the UN, to create strengthened Nordic defence cooperation and other initiatives that do not point to armaments, to more a-weapon and to everything that, in the long term, I believe, can be really dangerous for the future. I thought SF meant that too, and I thought you were against the 2 per cent armament, as we are still in the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151100	Thank you. Then it's mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151102	Thank you. I remain a little on the same subject, because the rapporteur said before: I dream that the world is different. Well, I dream it's sunny every day and it's only raining at night, but that's not gonna happen. It is not something I am in control of; it is not something I can do anything about. And what Enhedslisten trusts is that a huge war criminal, Vladimir Putin, suddenly thinks: I am going to disarm because Enhedslisten will propose that we have peacekeeping forces in the UN. When is it that we should resign from NATO? When should Denmark resign from NATO? It's not today, it's not tomorrow, so when is it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151136	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151137	We must resign from NATO or make another security policy cooperation when the structures are there, and they are not right now. But I'm wondering why I'm wondering why there are so many other parties in this Parliament who don't dare point to or see the alternatives far out in the future either. Because what are we gonna do? Should we continue to arm ourselves forever in Denmark, in Europe, in the United States? So does China, so does Russia, and then we end up in something that is really dangerous. I fully agree that right now we are facing very, very great challenges, with an aggressive Putin, but there are defence budgets, which are very large, in NATO, in Europe, already, so I think that increased armaments are simply the wrong way to go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151224	Thank you. Then it's mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151225	Yes, and one might wish that someone had told Vladimir Putin 10 years ago. Because the order outlined by Mrs Mai Villadsen is not the order in which it happened. This isn't something that could happen. That is something our enemy, the enemy of Europe, the enemy of the free world, has then the solution is not that we just sit down in one corner and pretend like nothing and wait for another structure to come. Then we'll be rolled over. The answer is, unfortunately, to rust up. If you want to avoid a violent confrontation with someone, you have to be able to respond hard and in cash and in the way that, unfortunately, is the only one they respect. Let me ask you something else: what does the Enhedslist say about it if Finland wants to be a member of NATO? That speaks for Nordic cooperation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151309	Thank you. Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151310	Of course you have to be able to answer back, but where does it end up? I would like the Left or some of the other parties involved in the national compromise to respond to that. I can hear parties, among other things. Left and Conservatives, do not reject the fact that we are putting American nuclear weapons on Danish soil, and when are we going to stop that armament? When we have a defence budget that is twice as large as that of Russia and China at NATO level, or four times as large? When's it gonna stop? Because right now you just have a plan called more and more, and I think that can just be really dangerous in the long term.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151348	Thank you. Then it's mr. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151351	Thank you to the rapporteur. I am not going to ask a question about NATO. What I want to hear from the rapporteur is about: under this government, economic inequality is increasing, and it can also be said that this is happening on the watch of Enhedslisten, because Enhedslisten is a support party. Can the rapporteur understand if there are some voters and citizens out there who are disappointed that economic inequality is increasing during a period of social democratic government with Enhedslisten as a support party?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151428	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151430	I think I will answer the same thing that Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr said up here from the platform earlier, namely that we are, of course, opposed to the rise in economic inequality. We are really, really concerned about the situation we are in now and therefore we are working hard in the negotiating room to get something done for the poorest in our society. I think it is wrong, and that is why we in the Enhedslisten were also not included in the reform agreement that was, Denmark can do more I.A., which helps to take money, among other things. from the green check and from the cash benefits recipients. I think that is quite wrong, but there are also initiatives that I am, in my view, proud of, which I think are right and which certainly increase inequality in relation to the Gini coefficient, but I think that should be done in relation to some elements.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151513	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151514	Inequality is increasing, we have no real reductions • agreements have been made on reductions in the future • and, unfortunately, the immigration policy is still largely the same as Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Lars Løkke Rasmussen led with Inger Løbberg and Pia Kjærsgaard. This, of course, is an opportunity to ask the rapporteur whether there is a red-green border. Or is the truth just that it doesn't exist and that you just, no matter what the government does, support it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151549	Thank you. Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151549-2	No, and sir knows that. Sikandar Siddique also very well. That is why we have produced a paper of understanding following previous quite great frustrations with social democratic governments, and there have been results: really big investments in welfare, really big green initiatives, although we do not think they go far enough. There has also been a temporary child benefit for the poorest families of children, and then we have made some improvements, although they are infinitely small and it hurts my heart in the field of foreigners, and that is why we are parliamentary basis for this government and not for a right-wing government, which will be exactly the opposite of what the Enhedslisten wants.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151626	Thank you. Then it's mr. Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151628	Thank you. I also want to talk about NATO. We've talked a lot about it, but I still don't think away quite, I get it. So my question is quite simple: why on earth is it that Enhedslisten and Mrs Mai Villadsen want Denmark out of NATO?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151641	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151642	NATO seems to us to have been very, very wrong on some points in recent years. They have been the aggressive side of a so-called defence alliance, of wars of aggression, which we have seen ended in complete horror. I am thinking of Afghanistan and Libya, and of course we cannot support that. In addition, NATO is in charge of armaments, and we are opposed to that in the Enhedslisten. It may be that in some respects some parts of the defence should be changed and changed, but we are opposed to aggressive armament with more fighter planes and more wars of aggression.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151723	Sir. Alex Vanopslagh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151724	But then I just do not understand why in the world it is that Enhedslisten believes that we should remain a member of NATO in the coming years and that this is not the time for us to resign. Because there's been these wars of aggression, and there's a significant build-up. In other words, I can tell you that what NATO is going to be about over the next ten years is about armaments and disarmament and deterrence, and the problem from the point of view of Enhedslisten is that NATO is arming up, and the problem is probably even greater now and here than it is in the future. I suppose it is urgent to get Denmark out of NATO if it is the problem. Yes, I just can't find the head and tail in the NATO policy of Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151758	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151759	What is urgent is to create a different security architecture in Europe and in the world and to reform the UN because, right now, individual countries can block important initiatives and do everything we need to achieve a more peaceful and descaled world. That is what we believe to be urgent and we have had the same attitude towards NATO for 30 years. And no resolution has been tabled to withdraw because the other ideal conditions are not yet there. But we work for them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151828	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151830	Thank you. I'm gonna ask you something else. After all, the government and the left have agreed to implement a performance reform, and for Enhedslisten it is as always about rewarding those who do not order anything with money from those who order something. It's socialism, it's known substance. But does it not concern Mrs Mai Villadsen that, when Enhedslisten demands the services set up, as we hear, then to a large extent will be immigrants from Muslim countries who will get money and more money paid out without ordering anything? Is this a responsible deal with the Danes' money?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151903	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151904	Now I'm getting a little confused. For one of my party members was last Thursday in the debate with Lars Boje Mathiesen from New Citizen who pointed out that in New Citizen people would not want to regulate the benefits so hard and that they would like to help some of the unemployed and people on cash benefits who had been hit so hard by the price increases. So I thought that we had a common cause here and that it was not just us who think that some of those who have been hit hard have a problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151937	Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405151937-2	We have a common cause when it comes to Danish citizens. In New Citizens we believe that foreign citizens must support themselves, and if they cannot, they must leave. And I have to ask: does it not at all concern Mrs Mai Villadsen that we are on top of the 30 billion or so? kr., we already spend on non-Western immigrants and descendants in Denmark, laying an additional bill that the Danes have to pay? Doesn't that concern Mrs. Mai Villadsen at all?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152002	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152003	No, what worries me is that there are parties in the Folketing that intend to discriminate between the backgrounds of one's life and whether one should have benefits or have raised one's benefits. New citizens claim that some people should be told that we should regulate only for Danish citizens and that everyone else should not have regulated their services in a different way. That is what concerns me most, and then, of course, the poverty that we can see particularly affecting children very hard and which I am very, very saddened that much more has not been done about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152037	Then it's mr. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152039	Now the Enhedslisten and the Alternative have joined forces in the fight against Lynetteholmen, in other words against building the great island in Copenhagen's harbour and building a huge city on it. We have been wondering lately that it looks as if the guarantees that it is self-financing are disappearing. The radical leader refers to the Minister of Transport, SF's leader does the same, and the Minister of Transport refers to City & Port, so it is as if the guarantee we had in funding one of Denmark's largest construction projects is crumbling. Does Mrs Mai Villadsen have the same wonder, and what does she think will happen?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152115	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152116	Yes, I have had the same experience and read the same articles and wondered about the answers from several, because the argument for making such a large project, both environmental and climate-damaging, was partly to build some homes.I acknowledge that it rested in itself that it was financially self-financing. It was good enough to increase a number of building prices, but nevertheless it was self-financing. But this completely erodes the foundation, so I am very much wondering about it and about many other things, and I really hope that it will make a number of parties stop Lynetteholmen in particular.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152151	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152152	We shall come back to that very much. My second question is on something else. It seems that also the requirements for Denmark, although we are climate leaders in the world and skilled at limiting CO2 There are several scientists who say that we may need to raise our CO2 2 by 2030. Will the Enhedslisten support raising the bar if necessary?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152216	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152217	There is no doubt about that. The climate crisis is the most urgent crisis for us. I have read a summary of yesterday's report myself, and that is just serious. We have to reduce our emissions very drastically in the world community within a very, very few years, and this also means that in Denmark, one of the richest countries in the world, we have to contribute. Something that can make me really, really worried is when I hear and see some politicians, especially internationally, say that we have to turn up the fossil energy these days.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152253	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152256	We heard the radical leader say a moment ago that referendums can be held, even if that is not an absolute requirement under the Constitution. I would like to know whether the Enhedslisten would be in favour of an amendment to the draft law on the abolition of the defence reserve tabled by the government, namely an amendment which would mean that if a majority in this Parliament wants to activate Article 42 (2) at some point. 2, in other words, what is at stake is a common defence of the European Union, so it requires a new referendum. Is such an amendment something that Enhedslisten would be in favour of?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152328	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152328-2	In general terms, we think it is sensible for the people to be heard as much as possible and for there to be referendums, so I will immediately back up, especially if something as drastic as that happens there, which has been called in popular terms a common European army and has been criticized. I think that would only make sense for those parties to join.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152355	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152356	I'm glad. In other words, anyone can go to the EU information website and fetch the Treaty of Lisbon and look up Article 42 and see that the objective is a common defence. I am glad that at least the Danish People's Party and the Enhedslisten and perhaps also other Citizen nods; see how the movement is rolling, can agree that if that happens, because that's what the EU parties say they won't, but as they will be allowed to do, you have to ask the people again. I'll sign for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152423	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152424	Yes, I think that would only make sense and I look forward to hearing the answers from the other parties on that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152433	Thank you. Then there are no more brief comments. Thank you to Mrs Mai Villadsen from the Enhedslisten, and that is the party leader from the Conservative People's Party, Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152447	Before the war, the city of Butja was a peaceful suburb of Kyiv. Now Russian soldiers have pulled out of town and left hell on earth. Where there used to be life and freedom, there are now bodies in the streets and executions of hindsight. We see mass graves, hear reports of torture and rape. The stories from there are horrible, the pictures are even worse. Putin and his soldiers are war criminals, and we must ensure strong consequences against the Russians. We must increase all kinds of supplies to Ukrainians and we must get an overview of what further economic sanctions we can impose on Russia, even if it is economic sanctions that hurt Europeans and Danes themselves. I am glad that we in the Folketing are united in supporting Ukraine. I am glad that we are almost all united in supporting NATO. I visited the Ukrainian ambassador at the embassy last week. No one doubts that Ukraine would have wanted them to have been members of NATO. Tomorrow I'm going to Stockholm. I am invited by the Swedish and Finnish opposition leaders, who have set up a joint NATO office to have the two countries join NATO as soon as possible. I am invited to give the Danish perspective as a happy NATO member. I propose that Denmark do everything we can and actively work to support both the Finns and the Swedes, our good neighbours, becoming part of the NATO community. This is a task which I am sure the government will also embark on and give priority to. Meanwhile, there are other ministers who can continue the internal political agenda. I am pleased that Denmark is taking its responsibility to help those who may be up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who are expected to come here. But it also comes with a bill that we have to do what we can to reduce by getting them into work and, of course, getting those who can work. TV 2 yesterday showed a story about the hotel and catering industry, which lacks 10,000 employees. They are happy that they can now get Ukrainians to work. Unfortunately, right now it takes about two months to get a work permit, and that is not good enough. Bureaucracy must not stand in the way of the Ukrainians who can and will contribute. It is in Denmark's interest and it is a responsibility that we must take on. It is also a responsibility for the Danes' money to be spent properly. The cost of fuel is more expensive, food is more expensive, electricity is more expensive, heating bills are more expensive, almost everything has become more expensive. The war in Ukraine makes the bill even higher, and we also have a responsibility to address it here in the Folketing. Our answer is that we do not just need an extra 69 billion blindly. kr. in the public sector. We believe that the Danes should be able to pay their own bills themselves and that we should let them keep some more of their own money.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152801	Thank you. The first brief remark is to Mr Seligman. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152804	Thank you. I would like to return to the first theme, which Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen mentioned the issue of the European Union and the defence reserve. One of the provisions which Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen would like Denmark to join, is Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, including Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union. The common security and defence policy includes the progressive framing of a common EU defence policy. This will lead to a common defence when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides. ▪ What will the time perspective for Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen, when he now wants Denmark to be part of this provision, which talks about a common EU defence, be about his thoughts about Danish participation in it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152840	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152841	We have the very clear position that the only place to decide whether Danish soldiers go on missions and at war is in the Danish Parliament. It's quite simple. And that's why there's no EU army coming in. It's a scaremonger. Nor do we have a NATO army; we have independent countries that decide to go on missions together, and that is what we mean in this context.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152904	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152906	What I was asking is what the Treaty says, as Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen would like Denmark to join. I am not the one who wants Denmark to be included in Article 42. Two, that's sir. Søren Pape Poulsen. That is why I do not think it is quite unreasonable for me to ask, when the Treaty states that this policy will lead to a common defence, that is to say, a common defence of the European Union. Søren Pape Poulsen has not, I know, excluded the provision from the vote that would certainly be news, and then the lone journalist who follows here could write about it. But that is why it is reasonable to ask: what are the thoughts on this common defence when Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen wants Denmark to be included in Article 42. Two?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152938	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152939	But this is taking place at intergovernmental level, and if it is to be changed, there must be a change in the Treaty, and we have the clear view that there is only one place to decide whether soldiers are sent out into the world, and that is in the Danish Parliament.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152949	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405152953	I would like to ask a few questions about the position of the Conservatives on what we in Denmark should invest in defence. What kind of threats are we looking at? I can see that the government has set up a commission to look at the threat picture that exists, and it will be here shortly with its report. But it may well be that the Conservatives have a special insight into what is interesting to invest in. So I would like to ask the Conservative Party President about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153017	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153018	I would just like to say that I do not want to give the full picture, because we in my own party would also like to discuss a little, in other words what is needed. I think we should all be very careful about putting ourselves in some positions before we have even got, what should we say, a good basis for those decisions, and the various safeguards will probably also have some different views on where to invest. Then I would also like to have a discussion with NATO. Well, what is it that NATO needs us to be able to do? If Mrs Pia Olsen asks me, I would like to say that I would like to see much more fighter planes, submarines and lots of conscripts and everything. But there will be a day when we must prioritise: what is the best thing for the Danish defence? And I'd like to get smarter there before I tie myself to the mast on something.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153100	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153100-2	I think that is a very wise attitude to this, as I have noted that the Conservatives' defence rapporteur, Mr. Rasmus Jarlov, has ridiculed that SF said that we might also have to invest in cybersecurity, that as one of the most digital countries in the world, namely Denmark, we might well need to protect our infrastructure somewhat better; this applies to our energy supply, our water supply, our health care, just to mention some of what has been digitised. It ridiculed the defence rapporteur and said: what we need is only fighters boom, boom, boom! I am glad that the Chairman of the Conservative Party sets the framework and says: we need to see what we need.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153138	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153139	At least I remember a defence settlement a few times ago, where fighter planes were to be bought and where we thought there was far too little. That meant we were out for a while. We're back in. Now I do not know the context in which it has been said. I am quite sure that there has not been any ridicule, but there is a need for equipment. However, I do agree that cybersecurity is crucially important, also in relation to the future threat picture.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153206	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153208	I am very pleased with the words of the Conservative leader on NATO. After all, Denmark is a very happy NATO country, and fortunately no one does, although some people disagree, who are ever allowed to shake, because NATO is the guarantor of the security and security of the Danes, and this has been the case for 73 years and one day or two. So I'm very, very happy about it. In this context, may I not ask you whether there will be any allegations in the discussion that is going to take place on 1 June • whether we in the Danish Parliament can not say a great deal today, very clearly, that we are not going to do anything through the European Union in defence that in any way undermines the strong attachment that we have to NATO.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153250	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153251	I can confirm that. I am really sorry that we are mixing it up and saying that if we remove the defence reserve, we weaken NATO or divide NATO up. No, NATO is the heart and heart of our defence policy. That's where we belong. But why in the world should it keep us from in Europe when, for example, we do not want to do so? The Americans are not involved, together with other countries to fight, among others. piracy in the Gulf of Guinea? We're a huge maritime nation. I don't understand. NATO is at the heart, but that is why we can nevertheless fully join the Western Free World.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153327	Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153328	It is precisely NATO that is at the heart, and it is NATO that is the whole basic prerequisite for the security and security of the Danes. But at the same time we are in a situation where we have been told by several rounds from the Americans that on the other side of the Atlantic there is a clear expectation that, in continuing strong cooperation between Europe and the North American continent, we will assume greater responsibility. That is why wanting to be on our own continent, while also strengthening our relationship with NATO, is not a contradiction, it is exactly a boat and it is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153404	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153405	I very much agree with that, and I would like to add something to that. We're some people who really think that this target is 2%. It's amazing. It is not a ceiling, but it is an objective that we must achieve. We go all the time and say: Now is the time to pay our own insurance premium, now is the time for us to pay our own defenses ourselves. That is the whole reason why it is no longer the Americans who have to come every time there is a challenge. When it comes to Europe and the European Union, we say: there we now find it nice that someone else is just taking the bill for us. I simply do not understand that, and I therefore believe that we have an obligation to be fully involved in the missions we then choose to participate in at European level.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153446	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153448	Thank you so much. I would like to ask a few questions about refugees from Ukraine. There has been a lot of controversy about this in relation to the position of the Conservative People's Party. I would like to ask: is it to be understood that not everyone fleeing Ukraine should have the same help in Denmark? Even if they have refugee status from Syria or have fled from another country and have entered Ukraine and are fleeing Putin's bombs, Conservatives do not think they should have the same help. Is this how we should understand the statement we have heard coming from the Conservatives?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153526	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153527	We have allowed ourselves to be slightly unpopularly nuanced, I have seen different places. We are of course of the opinion that Ukraine is our immediate area of responsibility, and that is where, according to our views on asylum and refugee policy, we have a special obligation. Then we shouldn't leave anyone behind. So, if there are people living in Ukraine who have fled Syria, Afghanistan or Somalia, then they can of course, on equal terms with all other asylum seekers, seek asylum in Poland, Romania, Denmark or where they come to. We just think that one should distinguish between making a rule for Ukrainians and one for everyone else.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153607	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153608	You want me to understand that people who run from Putin's bombs aren't even? According to Conservatives, people with Syrian background who are bombed in Ukraine and who flee to Denmark must simply have a different treatment than people with Ukrainian background and a Ukrainian passport. I think it is quite creepy that Denmark's unofficial Prime Minister's candidate can think of such a thing. I don't understand.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153633	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153634	I am very, very sorry that in this way I frighten Mrs Mai Villadsen, but I just feel that it must then be the case that what we see now in Denmark is that we have Syrians and Afghans here in Denmark, who must be here on two different bases, depending on whether they have been in Ukraine or not. We don't think so. Then there's probably a difference between what you and I think you should do about it. The Ukrainians are here under a special law because Ukraine belongs to our neighbourhood, and that is where we are obliged to help. But nobody has to be left behind for Putin's bombs, but then you just have to come here under normal conditions of asylum. That is what we have said, because we think there is a nuance here, it is important to stick to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153707	Then it's Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153709	Thank you. When Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen sat with the government, taking responsibility for making the finances robust. Unfortunately, that room for manoeuvre was lost to the Red Government, and now Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen then made a deal that debtes the Danes and releases 13 billion. kr. more that the Red Government can squander along with the left wing. In New Citizens, we agree that we have to go up to 2%. of our bnp, which we had promised NATO to spend on our defence, but we strongly disagree that we should do so by indebteding the Danes and giving the left 13 billion. kr. further, which they can use on their welfare vows. - Sir... Søren Pape Poulsen explain to me the logic of that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153750	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153750-2	The logic lies in the fact that we have reached a national compromise where we agree that in a few years' time we will be spending 2%. of bnp on the Danish defence. It affects our economy. However, if we now had a bourgeois majority, I would of course say that we should not use the opportunities offered by that agreement. I would say there that we must, of course, discuss some reforms, because we need reforms in this country. At least I know we agree on that. So I still hope that financial responsibility will be there, even if this opportunity has been given. That's what we're gonna get tested. At least I'll keep an eye on what the government is going to do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153827	Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153828	Now it is just the case that we have a large red majority and the opportunity to have the extra 13 billion. kr. You've given it to the left. And I don't believe that the left wing is going to make bourgeois reforms, the Prime Minister, the Social Democratic Party and the other red parties. In fact, the Social Democratic Party programme says that 50 000 more people must be employed in the public sector, and I know that it is not conservative politics to make the world's largest public sector even bigger. So how can one defend at a time with a large red majority and with the prospect of a large red majority after the next election to give so much money to a left and debt the Danes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153908	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153909	But, may I say to Mrs Pernille Vermund, should we not agree to do all we can to ensure that there is not a red majority after the next elections, because then all this will not happen?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153919	Thank you. Then it's mr. Edmund Joensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405153922	Thank you. Unfortunately, we have to note that drug crime has come to the Faroe Islands in earnest. And here in Denmark there is a great deal of talk about local police, but not so much in the Faroe Islands. Does the rapporteur not think that we should talk about the whole Kingdom community when we talk about the local police? The problems are the same. And especially when it is a new form of crime and a crime that particularly affects young people. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154005	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154006	I would very much like to discuss that with Mr. Edmund Joensen. The most important thing for me is that whether you live in the Faroe Islands or in Greenland or in Denmark, you can be safe and that there are police and officers enough to ensure the safety of the citizens. Then we can call it a lot of things. The most important thing for me is that there is a police force present that allows citizens to live in security throughout our entire community.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154032	Sir. Edmund Joensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154034	Thank you for a good answer. Especially when it is a new form of crime that particularly affects young people, there is a lot to be said for a police force to be able to help a great deal in this way. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154054	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154055	Well, I agree, and I think that the most important thing is that we have the police to do so, in order also to combat the forms of crime that are constantly evolving. We must say that we have a Danish police force and a Faroese police force and a Greenlandic police force that is becoming more skilled and more skilled. The challenge is that so do the criminals. They are constantly finding new ways, and I very much agree that we who have to keep up to date to keep up with and fight that kind of crime wherever it goes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154117	Thank you. Then it's mr. Sjúrður Skaale.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154120	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. The Conservative People's Party is a party which is very much concerned with defence and which burns itself to be such a defence party. That's a good thing. You're part of the defense settlements. It was also included in the so-called Arctic Capacity Package, which is about setting up radar systems in, among others. The North Atlantic. But when you spend money putting a burglar alarm in your house, you must also be prepared to intervene if the thief appears; if the thief comes. What does the rapporteur think will happen and must happen if, for example, there is to be a change in the situation? is a hostile aircraft in Faroese airspace?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154159	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154159-2	Well, I imagine we're defending the kingdom, quite simply. I am not quite sure what the questioner means by his question. I'm just being honest. But, of course, we have a kingdom to defend, and we must do so wherever freedom is denied.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154221	Sir. Sjúrður Skaale.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154221-2	The questioner believes that there is no airport on the Faroe Islands where there is no military aircraft there is nothing to send up into the air. Since 2005, the Royal Air Force has been withdrawing Russian aircraft 136 times from British airspace. We don't have those capabilities. Therefore, it is unclear what should happen if and when we see a Russian aircraft in Faroese airspace.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154244	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154244-2	Okay, but then I think it makes sense when we are members of NATO that we also cooperate there and see how we do this in the best possible and effective way in cooperation. It is not certain that the best and effective is that we have x number of fighters standing on the Faroe Islands. It is not certain that that is what is good. But if we work together, it can ensure it. Because there's NATO a defence alliance where we're in the middle of nowhere. The most important thing for me is that some of the alliance take care of us, no matter who it is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154310	Then it's Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154314	Thank you. I would also like to ask Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen on what I have asked about earlier, namely the need to really advance green investment with, among other things, the need. the development of energy from offshore winds. We are also waiting to be convened for negotiations on a green tax reform, as both Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen's party and my own party are in it. Then Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen is also helping to find the funding... we have also discussed this here... to carry out this green tax reform? I think that will be needed so that we can compensate the companies and as soon as possible so that we can get started.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154351	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154351-2	I have the approach to green tax reform that this is a bottom-up task and that this is something we need to solve together. We simply have an obligation to do so. How it is to be linked up then, I think that both the questioner and I are going to be a little complex to resolve, but that must be resolved, and we have only one interest, and that is to speed up the green transition, and no matter how much speed we put on it, we all know that we also have challenges which, due to the conflict in Ukraine, need to be resolved in the short term. But we must not forget the long term of independence, among other things. Russian gas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154427	Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154428	I am very pleased with the commitment that this should be done quickly and that we need to take decisions, but also to find joint funding. We in the Radical Left have proposed a green fund to accelerate this transformation, but also to finance the green tax reform, because I do not think that it will work if we simply impose taxes on companies without helping the conversion to take place quickly so that it will not happen quickly enough.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154456	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154457	I very much agree that we should try to have a very open mind on how this is to be linked and financed, because we will achieve nothing for the climate of the world if it means that our companies are moving elsewhere. There, of course, we have a common interest in ensuring that we allocate resources to invest in the green transition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154517	Thank you. Then it is Mrs Aaja Chemnitz Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154519	Thank you for a good speech, and thank you for the good cooperation also in general. A great deal is being said about NATO, and so we are doing in Greenland too, and we are negotiating a foreign and security policy for Greenland so that we can hopefully also have a common one for the kingdom. As far as NATO is concerned, we also know that a strength target will have to be achieved next year in relation to what to focus on. In NATO there is a lot of talk about High North, and the fact that we have a debate about how much we really need to interfere in the Arctic is something we find extremely exciting. So I would like to hear: how much will the Arctic fill in a future defence settlement if it stands for Conservatives?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154558	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154600	I think we need to look at what challenges we are facing today. And with the challenges we face today, the Arctic is, to put it mildly, a really important and interesting area also on the security policy agenda, which is why it will also be something that we need to address in a defence settlement. I think it is crucial that we have a focus on the Arctic.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154622	Mrs Aaja Chemnitz Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154623	Thank you. I also know that Conservatives are interested in ensuring that there is an equal or at least a strengthened cooperation between Greenland and Denmark. I would like to know if you have made some thoughts forward in terms of how to strengthen the Kingdom community and cooperation within the Kingdom community, including getting some more knowledge about each other.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154642	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154643	We have a lot of ideas. And we've actually spent some time making a play about the Kingdom community. We haven't introduced that yet, and I won't have to bring it from here. But we actually have some thoughts that we have to make sure and it has to start, from when the children are small we get a much better knowledge of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. I believe that Greenland and the Faroe Islands have a much better knowledge of Denmark than the other way around. I think we have an obligation to do so. If there is to be a stronger connection in the Kingdom community, we simply need to know more about each other. And it's about schools, it's about media, it's about a lot of things.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154721	Thank you. Then it's mr. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154722	Thank you, President, and thank you to the rapporteur. Following on from what Radicals asked, Conservatives have been out to say that you want a high and uniform CO2 there I was just curious whether it applies to all greenhouse gases and whether it applies to all sectors.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154742	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154742-2	I think we need to be very open about the fact that we want a uniform CO2 level. Well, yes, we could make it so difficult for Aalborg Portland to make cement that they would close tomorrow. So that's 2 million. t CO 2 But where is that cement to be produced? Probably somewhere else where pollution would be great. That is why we have an interest in finding solutions so that we keep our jobs and do something good for our climate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154824	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154826	Although the rapporteur did not answer the question directly, I actually got the feeling that the rapporteur tried to answer it, and I interpret the answer as saying that with the same uniform CO2 that is how I interpret the answer. Can the rapporteur make a suggestion as to what Conservatives are doing about this CO2
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154852	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154853	I think it's too complicated to stand around and put money out of here. After all, this is about the discussion that we must have on the basis of the report that has been made about how we ensure a CO2 that will be a balancing act. Then I know that the Free Greens and we in the Conservative People's Party probably have different views on how hard the various industries can be hit and what the cost to those industries must be. We'll have to take that to the negotiating room.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154926	Thank you. Then it's mr. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405154929	Thank you. That was actually the Faroese Member, sir. Edmund Joensen, who led me on to this question. He asked about drugs and hard drugs. I'm sure sir. Søren Pape Poulsen shares the Alternative's concern about the abuse of both cannabis and hard drugs. After all, in Denmark consumption is not decreasing; it is actually a huge problem at the moment. In Portugal, attempts have been made to decriminalise it, and that does not mean that you can just take it. This means that when you are caught, you are not sent to jail; then you are sent to the health authorities. This also means that the consumption of hard drugs in Portugal is gradually halved, in that it is almost seen as a disease rather than an abuse. What do you think, sir? Søren Pape Poulsen about trying to think new in this case?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155011	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155012	I think we should never say that we will never think again, and then I will break down and confess that I do not know Portugal's solution. I just have to be honest with you. I am having a very, very difficult time with this debate, and I think the questioner knows my political position here too. Because I think that by all means we should fight against young people having their lives ruined and that there are criminals earning huge sums of money from this. If there are alternative solutions, I am happy to discuss them, but I am not right where I think we should have a legalisation of this kind of thing. I don't think that's my first guess.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155048	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155048-2	I guess I didn't just bet on that either. I also have another question. I have sometimes mentioned the matter of becoming independent of Putin's gas and the involvement of the people, the involvement of a lot of people in getting on with making local energy communities......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... There are a lot of Danes who want local energy supply, which is both helpful in relation to the 70-percent objective, but also provides an alternative to the fossil gas. What does the party leader think about spreading the fight against Putin's gas to the people this way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155125	Sir. Søren Pape Poulsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155127	Without committing myself to the mast in any way whatsoever, I would just like to say that in the situation that Europe and the world are currently facing, I think we need to be very undogmatic in all this and simply look at every conceivable possibility. Any small step helps in being able to become independent of Putin's gas. We should then also just be honest with each other and say that this is not something we do with a snap. But let's get everyone on board, let's have the discussion about how we're gonna solve this. I think now is the time to have a very open mind on this issue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155159	Thank you. Then there are no more brief remarks to the Conservative Party leader, so thank you to Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen. The next party leader is from the Danish People's Party. Here you go, sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155215	Thank you, President. Something is the rat in the state of Denmark, says Marcellus in Shakespeare's famous play at Kronborg. There's something rotten in Denmark. If you see the past weeks and months in Danish politics, you would almost think that you were in Shakespeare's time, because there are indeed things that do not tolerate the light of day, but which still come out. First of all, there is the whole discussion of the way in which we may have deliberately, perhaps unconsciously, made a ballot paper for a vote which, for the third time, will try to settle an EU reservation, in which the wording is clearly formulated in order to urge people to vote in a certain way. Secondly, there is the whole discussion of our possible right of veto in the EU Treaty, where there is a lack of transparency, that the right of veto is something that can be abolished in the EU context without asking the people, because we in Denmark do not regard it as sovereign, what voting procedures are. Then you try to talk your ambitions down by saying: 'Well, this is intergovernmental cooperation'. One forgets that in the context of intergovernmental cooperation in the Treaty of Lisbon there are already more than ten areas where majority decisions are made, and then one is frantically trying to get the debate going on outside Denmark in France, in Germany, in Brussels and elsewhere about a regular EU army to be almost such a fatamorgana that does not exist at all. So when Angela Merkel in the European Parliament talks about a genuine European army when Macron in France talks about the same thing when von der Leyen, Michel etc. If you talk about it, it doesn't exist. Then it is just something that exists up in the head of us EU critics and EU opponents. There is indeed something rotten that is wrong, not least because what the European Union is currently doing with its military capacity-building is not just a mirage. This is a real threat to Europe's freedom and our democracy, and therefore also to Denmark, because it will inevitably lead to a division of NATO, as NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg himself has said. If a European defence system is created with its own structure of command, it can only challenge and share NATO. How could we have an EU defence? What is perfectly clear in the Treaty with six EU members who are not NATO members without having an independent command structure? It doesn't make sense. That is why it will be my task, the task of several parties and hopefully a majority of Danes on 1 June and culminating on 1 June to clear up just a little bit of this rottenness. It emanates from the EU, but it is well carried by the EU parties at Christiansborg. Thank you, President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155514	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155519	I know, sir. Morten Messerschmidt is very interested in the history of the European Union, and that is why I really want to go back to the national compromise when it was made in 1992. At that time there was a discussion about the Western European Union. The reason why we had to have the Danish reservation was, in fact, that it was a reservation with regard to the Western European Union, in which France was a major stakeholder because they were not members of NATO. - Sir... Mr Morten Messerschmidt makes us all aware of what has happened to the Western European Union since then and European defence in this regard, and what has happened to France in relation to the Western European Union?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155554	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155555	I know little has happened to the Western European Union. It's not much that it's been involved in. France, on the other hand, is committed to NATO and is now, in the area of EU defence cooperation, an active voice when it comes to precisely creating an EU army. I have experienced, not just Macron himself, but multiple French parliamentarians in the European Parliament across the various groups speaking very warmly about how it would be better for an EU defence, an EU army, to engage in the many African wars currently being waged by the French military, Mali, Somalia, etc. That is what is happening in France, I would say to Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155632	Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155634	Well, I guess I'll answer the question myself. That is always the advantage of asking a question, namely that you can answer it. The Western European Union has actually been abolished, it is fair to say in relation to the reservations and the discussion we had at the time. I know that the Danish People's Party did not exist at the time, but the Progress Party did, and they thought it was an unimportant reservation. But it was later closed down. The Western European Union does not exist today. France has joined NATO, under NATO. There are, after all, other interests at stake, including French participation. I just think it is important in that picture and in the historical context of an EU defence. After all, we are in another discussion today. I think it must be fair to say in the discussion.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155713	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155714	I must admit in every way that we are not in 1993. Perhaps, however, in reply to Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr's question, I can read out the provisions which the reservation covers today, that is to say one of them, Article 42 (1). 2 which I also mentioned to Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen earlier: The common security and defence policy includes the progressive framing of a common EU defence policy. This will lead to a common By the way, the first defence came in with the Treaty of Lisbon. So something new happens all the time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155743	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155746	Thank you. I would like to ask Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, about Mr. Morten Messerschmidt acknowledges that US governments and managements, through several administrations, have expressed a separate desire for the EU to take greater responsibility for its own defence and security.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155811	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155812	No, I do not recognize that, but I recognise that several successive American administrations have asked Europe to take greater responsibility for its own security. And there is, of course, a very big difference between the European Union and Europe. Firstly, Europe is made up of twice as many countries as the European Union, and secondly, it is made up of nation states with a number of advantages, among others. democracy. It is completely alien in the European Union. However, I recognise the desire of the Americans that we in Europe take a greater share of our responsibility for neighbourhoods. I think that should be done within NATO, and there is nothing to prevent that from happening. Mrs Sofie Carsten Nielsen will be aware that among other things: the first operations in Bosnia were NATO operations without the participation of the United States. So there is nothing to prevent an increased military contribution from taking place within NATO but consisting of the European countries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155859	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155900	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt simply does not recognise that American administrations believe that this can also be done by strengthening the EU's defence and security policy and that this is the way to strengthen it. Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, that American administrations believe that it will divide NATO if the EU strengthens its defence and security policy and Denmark becomes part of it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155923	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155925	In fact, I believe that the Americans will abstain fairly from this kind of institutional debate. I also believe that the Americans will pay attention to the fact that we are beginning to advise them on how to establish their constitution. What the Americans are interested in is that we in Europe will be able to deal more militarily with conflicts that are closer to us than to the Americans. That's why we need the 2%. of bnp. That is why we need to spend much more on the military. However, that this should be done within an EU cooperation that would like to have a common defence and a common EU army that would split NATO, I find it very difficult to see is in a Danish, American or, as such, global interest.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405155958	Thank you. The next brief remark is to the Prime Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160001	There were many things in Mr. Morten Messerschmidt's introduction, I actually disagree with that, but we will have ample opportunity to discuss it. What I really think is remarkable is that the Danish People's Party does not find any reason to mention it at all when we have been through a weekend with such violent attacks on a civilian population in Ukraine and such brutal behaviour by Putin. In other words, we are faced with a war on our own continent and are endeavouring, in different contexts, to do all we can from Denmark to help Ukraine to the best possible extent and to strengthen NATO and strengthen NATO's preparedness so that we can deal with this situation. The President of the Danish People's Party did not find that any reason to mention it in just one word.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160043	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160045	After all, the Prime Minister has been so in and out of the Chamber during the course of the debate and has perhaps not had the opportunity to hear what I have said in questions to some of the other party leaders. But I have mentioned this in many other contexts. When I choose here to devote my time to the defence reserve and to it, I would say inconvenient behaviour, which the Prime Minister has also chosen in this context, this is, of course, due to the fact that this, as I understand it, is the first and last time we meet as party presidents in the Assembly hall before 1 June. In other words, the Prime Minister's party has already helped to block the fact that we could have an urgent defence reservation request. That is why I am a little surprised, but I note that the Prime Minister finds it strange that I am spending my speaking time on it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160123	There is another brief comment to be made on Mrs Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160127	I think it is more remarkable that one does not feel the urge and need to enter into the discussion on Ukraine at all. I think that is remarkable. This is the one thing that I find difficult to grasp in the very, very special time we are in Europe, and the other is the need to use violent words and make such violent claims. You could discuss the substance and content.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160156	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160200	Well, words are substance, especially with regard to those chosen by the Prime Minister in relation to the ballot slip. Words mean something, and that is why, of course, I also take my words seriously, as I think it is, that one is actually trying to mislead the Danish people into thinking that they are not voting on the abolition of an EU reservation, but on European cooperation, which could just as well be NATO. I really think it's inconvenient. But I'm sorry if the Prime Minister finds Shakespeare and Marcellus' words too serious for the Assembly Hall. I think they are very apt and appropriate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160226	The next brief remark is to Mrs Mai Villadsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160229	Thank you. After all, there has been much discussion and controversy about the wording of the ballot paper that we will all have to cross either yes or no in just a few months' time. The wording is, of course, that Denmark can participate in European cooperation in the field of security and defence, and that is why I would like to hear whether the rapporteur cannot recognise that we are already paying for a European Defence Fund, that we can already participate in a lot of civil operations, but also operations which are about training police officers and other things, and whether the rapporteur does not believe that this has to do with certainty.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160303	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160305	I do so very much, and we are also involved in this at EU level, because the defence clause only covers Articles 42 to 46. And then there are many things that can be regarded as European cooperation, including defence. I believe, for example, that NATO is a European defence cooperation. There are at least some European NATO countries with which I am very pleased that Denmark stands shoulder to shoulder, such as Denmark. Great Britain. One could also mention the OSCE, and indeed the Nordic Council too. It is also European cooperation. That is why it is so misleading that when you really want a vote to abolish the EU defence reserve, you do not mention the EU or the defence reserve.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160343	Thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmidt. The next speaker is Mrs Pernille Vermund's apologies, a brief comment from Mr Vermund. Sjúrður Skaale here at the last minute. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160358	Now I do not necessarily agree with the rapporteur in all, but thank you for your speech. The rapporteur mentioned that not all countries in Europe are part of the European Union. Nor is it the whole of Denmark that is part of the European Union, and now, of course, I expect a polemic response, but how does the rapporteur think the consequences will be for the Kingdom community if a yes vote is taken on 1 June?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160419	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160421	Firstly, I would like to say that I very often see with a longing envy to the Faroe Islands precisely as an area which, in the case of the Kingdom community, is outside the European Union. It must be nice to have your freedom, even if it is so often exercised through the Kingdom community here in this Chamber. However, I would be genuinely concerned about how defence policy will develop if a majority of this Parliament were free to live out their hot dreams that most of it should take place through the European Union, which the Faroe Islands are happily spared from membership of.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160453	Thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmidt. There are no more brief comments. The next speaker is Mrs Pernille Vermund from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160506	It has become expensive for the Danes. Prices are rising and bills are growing, but wages are the same. This is the situation for most Danish families. So what do you do? You sit down and look into your budget. You cut something away and something else down; you save where you can. That's not how you do it in here in the Folketing. Finally, when you recognise that defence needs to be strengthened, you do not save anywhere. You just borrow the money from future generations. They'll have to take care of that. When the costs of Ukrainian refugees are to be paid, there is an immediate demand for taxes to be increased. That bill, too, ends up in the nursery. Natural savings elsewhere, on foreign aid, are proclaimed immoral. On the other hand, no one is considering the morals of politicians allowing Danish families to pay for rising prices and increasing bills, while the state continues to shovel in money and wants to tighten the tax screw once again. I think it's immoral to let the Danes save while the politicians just use away. The right thing to do would be to share the bill. The money must be returned to the Danes, not in the form of random grants, but in the form of lasting sensible reliefs in taxes and charges. When Danish families have to save, politicians also have to. When the Danish families have to cut the budget and prioritise between the fun and the necessary, the politicians must of course do the same exercise with public spending. But you don't want to. Can it really be that just 1% can't be cut? of public spending, but well can be cut 7%. out of the family budget? No, of course not. There is fuss everywhere in the public economy, and foreign aid is a good place to start. It is at best ineffective and, at worst, directly detrimental to economic growth in developing countries. Denmark's Radio is an outdated state medium which could easily cope with a subscription scheme. Job centers do no good to anyone except the 12,000 employees. Job centers can be closed and replaced by something much better and much cheaper. And by resolving foreign policy from scratch, we can start to reverse a fixed cost of more than 30 billion. kr. a year to an income. It is only a crazy-good country that is pursuing an alien policy that is making a deficit. Foreign policy must, of course, be a good business for Denmark. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160805	Thank you to Mrs Pernille Vermund. There are no brief comments. Yes, there is a brief comment from the Prime Minister. Here you go, Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160818	Yes, it is just one question: does it not please Mrs Pernille Vermund that at last there is a political majority in Denmark that actually affects Denmark's accession to the 2%?? I fully agree that several parties have had the wish, but it has not been possible to put the pen on paper in the past and actually make the decision. So if you are happy with NATO membership and I welcome the fact that New Citizens are, and you think it is important that we arm ourselves at a time when our security structure is threatened from outside, when there is war in Ukraine, can we not recognise and rejoice that we have actually succeeded in making that decision in Denmark at last?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160858	Here you go, Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160900	Yes, we in New Citizens are very happy about that. It is clear that when a motion for a resolution is tabled that we should increase our defence budget to 2%. It is a pity that we have promised NATO, and it will be voted down. Well, that's one of them. in writing. - (FR) The Social Democrats and the other parties that are now behind the agreement are voting in favour. The parties who voted in favour at the time, the DF and the Liberal Alliance, were not even invited to the negotiations this time. However, although we have not been invited to the negotiations, I am pleased that it has been decided to achieve that objective. What does not please me is that we are not prepared to find the money for it in a public budget of 1 100 billion. kr. at a time when the Danes must spin and save. I don't think that's fair.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160941	Thank you to Mrs Pernille Vermund. There are no more questions. The next speaker is Mr. Sikandar Siddique. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405160957	Thank you, President, and thank you to my colleagues. The terrible situation in Ukraine has filled a great deal, and we have rightly spoken about it. But that conflict also has a different side, which I will try now with my remaining time to put some focus on. No one can be in any doubt that there is a huge difference in how we as party leaders view refugee policy. However, regardless of what policy might look like, I sincerely hope that the situation here has also shown us that we can agree that we in Denmark have gone too far in refugee policy. Denmark was the first country to accede to the Refugee Convention. Our asylum system is now being criticised both in the European Parliament and by European bodies, and conditions are being compared to torture-like conditions. We are simply a place where we send people back Assad's tyranny and Putin's bombs without blinking. And we are constantly hearing stories about young women aged 18 and 19 who have come here as children, for example. As a 10-year-old, and have lived here all their young lives, we would like to send them back to Assad's reign of terror, to Putin's bombs and to the hands of the Taliban. We have forgotten that it is real people who are in our asylum system. At least it seems that way to me. With the special law for Ukrainian refugees, the Folketing has proven that it is well known how to treat refugees properly, how to give them the best opportunities to succeed in life and help themselves. That is why I find it hard to understand that we are continuing to keep the rest of our refugees trapped in this inhuman asylum hell, as they call it out there, where people are being destroyed by insecurity, and where children must, in time and in time, see the police come thundering and physically forcing people with them. Families with children rot in our asylum centres for years where they are locked in a daily life without rights. They can't work, they can't train, and they can't decide where they want to live. In fact, they can't decide when they want to cook. It is not only an unworthy existence; it also destroys people, destroys them, and tears all hope out of their hands. We allow children to grow up in the Danish asylum hell children who are going home to life in the asylum center when friends meet to play PlayStation. We steal the children's lives, the childish joy and the eternal burning hope that all we parents love to experience in our own children. That hope and that joy we have put out for these asylum children. When you talk about standing on the wrong side of history, you talk about a Denmark that went from being a humanitarian light in a dark world to being a country from which war refugees flee. Will we be remembered as the politicians who allowed families to be torn apart like those who forced spouses to choose between following their husband or wife or giving their children a chance for a life of safety? We have just proved that we can do the right thing, so there is no excuse for letting the children rot in these inhuman asylum prisons all their upbringing. We can and must be better. Thanks for the word, guys.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161316	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161318	Thank you for one as always indignant and enthusiastic speech. The other day we saw an example from a Danish repatriation centre, where a Kurdish-Iranian woman was maintained, and it seemed like some very violent and brutal scenes. That's what we're putting the police to do, so it's not really the ones I'm putting up with in this question. But what does Mr. Sikandar Siddique that the political solution to such matters could be?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161345	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161347	Thank you for the question. After all, the Free Greens and the Alternative have just called the Minister in consultation so that we can have an explanation of what happened, because it seems extremely brutal. I believe and now I have 19 seconds' speaking time to acknowledge that there are some refugees we cannot send back for legal and other reasons, because we do not have extradition agreements. And when we are in the situation we are in, we also have to say that when we are a rule of law and when we are a humanist society, we cannot have systems where we break down people. Therefore, people must come out and have a daily life like the rest of us so that we do not break down people, including children.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161424	Here you go, sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161427	In fact, I very much agree that the matter must be resolved politically. I believe that desperation can be very great when you run the risk of being sent home to a place where you are in danger, where you are being persecuted, where you risk prison, and that is why I very much agree that it is perhaps a question of ensuring that at least those people who are at risk of precisely this type of persecution are saved in the first place.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161456	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161458	Yes, also because we are right and proper to say that we must help the Ukrainians who are fleeing Putin's bombs, but it is also Putin's bombs that are being used in Syria, and those who are fleeing must also be helped. I think the time has come for us to say once and for all in Danish politics: okay, where we have come in Danish refugee policy, and can we not do this better? That is my appeal to my colleagues.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161528	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mr. Alex Vanopslagh. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161531	Thank you. I have a simple question for the rapporteur. What is the rapporteur's position on the view of women and sexual minorities in Islam?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161541	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161543	Here we go again. I stand up here as a political leader of a secular party. I am not standing up here as an imam, which is why I am not going to explain Islam in any way. If the rapporteur is interested in knowing what the view of women and homosexuals is, then I would suggest that you grab an imam.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161609	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161611	Fair, but then let me ask another question in a slightly different way. What does the rapporteur think about the view of sexual minorities and women in Muslim environments in Denmark, in other words in those areas where there is an overweight of immigrants and refugees from the Middle East? What is the rapporteur's assessment of what the view of sexual minorities and women is in those areas?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161631	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161633	I visited a shelter yesterday in Vordingborg called Haven. I left there with two things. One thing is that women's oppression, women's violence, no religion has, no ethnicity has. It exists in all colors, in all religions, not in all religions, but in the way we practice religions. It has a common factor: the patriarchate. It is all those places where there is a man-dominated culture where the patriarchate dominates, whether it is in Muslim circles or other circles. That is what is crucial, not a certain color of skin or a certain religion. That's how I experience it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161713	The next question is Mrs Mette Frederiksen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161720	We can surely agree that ethnic minorities are heavily over-represented at Denmark's women's crisis centres. In my view, this is one of the major problems of the lack of integration in Denmark. Actually, that was something else I wanted to ask about. One of the things we have mentioned before, including with other rapporteurs, and on which I think we can agree, is that we need more renewable energy both to get out of the Russian gas, but also for the sake of the climate, and the two things meet each other. Does the rapporteur agree that, in order to speed up the green transition and to create even more renewable energy, we also have to go a little pragmatically to that point as to what it will require of different decisions?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161754	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161756	Indeed, we in the Green Group believe that we must take every possible action in relation to the climate. One of my colleagues got the question: who is the greatest threat to our security? I think it was the SF chairman who said that security policy is also climate policy. The climate crisis is the biggest enemy we face. So yes, we must do everything we possibly can to achieve our goal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161824	Here you go, Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161828	But does this also mean that where there may be some environmental considerations and some climate considerations that come together, we have to go to it openly because we need to speed up renewable energy? And then the rapporteur forgot to confirm: is it not true that ethnic minority women are heavily over-represented in the country's women's crisis centres and that it emphasises that we have some very, very special problems in parts of the immigrant environment in Denmark, unfortunately, which mainly affect women?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161854	Here you go, Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161856	So let me say quite clearly here: wherever we find this, it must be combated. I do not know if this is the case according to the statistics, but if it is the case that they are over-represented, whoever it is, wherever it is, it must be combated. I think that is important for me to emphasise here. The patriarchate, the oppression of women, the violence against women must be combated, no matter what environment it is in, Muslim environments, non-Muslim environments. It must be combated.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161922	The next question is Mrs Pernille Vermund. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161925	Thank you. Two questions, 1: Does the rapporteur think that Muslim environments in Denmark are more patriarchal than Christian or non-religious? 2: Does the rapporteur recognise that about a quarter of the immigrants and descendants from Muslim countries who were asked in a survey in 2007 said that they would like to have homosexuality banned in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161953	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405161955	But what I'm aware of is that as I come up here, I have to answer questions about Muslim environments. At any rate, this is something I am sensitive to, and I believe that the citizens out there are also aware of it. My speech wasn't about Muslims, my speech was about refugees. I think that very much about the mood in here in relation to Muslims, the mood in here in relation to being brown, that is to say, being treated differently. Here we have 12 to 13 party leaders who come up and talk about NATO, talk about Ukraine and talk about refugees, and then when I come up here as a brown party leader, I get questions about Islam and Muslims. That's really what it says.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162030	Thank you. Here you go, Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162032	Well, that's ridiculous. The colour of the skin has nothing to do with Islam, and when we ask about this, it is because the rapporteur gets a question that the rapporteur does not answer. The rapporteur is the only one in this Chamber who will not respond to this, and in reality he almost denies that there are problems in relation to several Muslim minorities in Denmark in relation to women's oppression and to the view of homosexuality. So it has nothing to do with skin color. It has something to do with politics and the fact that Islam is also a political ideology that affects our society.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162107	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162109	I said it clearly: no matter where that oppression takes place, it must be combated. Free Greens are a feminist party. We fight hard against women's oppression. I have had several proposals in this Chamber to combat it, to combat women's killings and to combat women's violence. I can only say this clearly: whatever environment it is in, it must be combated. Does it exist in every environment? Yes, it does. Do you want to fight it? Yes, it is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162136	The next question is Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162138	In fact, I did not intend to ask a question, but because of the answer I have to ask a question, because I believe that the majority of Muslims in Denmark work well integrated and work well in our society, but we also have groups that do not. I have a friend named Ahmad Mahmoud who wrote a book called "Black Country." He's jumped out as a faggot as a grown-up, and he's been followed because he's gay. And if you ask him, he says it's not just because he's gay, because if he had been ethnically Danish, he wouldn't have had the problem. Recognizes Mr. Sikandar Siddique that there is
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162213	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162214	I recognise that there is homophobia in some Muslim environments too, I recognise that, and that is also why I keep trying to say: be careful not to be biased; listen to me say what I am saying. I say that there are homophobia and women's oppression in Muslim environments too, and that must be combated. I say this quite clearly and quite clearly. But sometimes I feel like that's not what you hear me say. You'd rather hear me say something else that I'm not saying. And that's really what I'm talking about here, too, that we've been having a debate all afternoon, and then I'm coming up here as party leader, and then I have to answer questions about Islam and Muslims. I think it's dishonest, I think.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162256	Here you go, Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162258	But I'm just asking because I got confused about the answer. And I guess that's fair enough without having to be related to anything. It is the case when we have a debate in the Folketing that we follow up on each other. I think I also followed up a question about NATO to Mrs Mai Villadsen after Mr. Søren Pape Poulsen. That is because there must also be a free debate. That must also be acknowledged. And I was just surprised, because I know that there is honor-related violence in Denmark. It is not ethnic Danish, it is people of other ethnic origin we talk about when we talk about honor-related violence. I take this seriously, just as I take all other violence seriously. And that's just why I got up because I was wondering if there was something I hadn't heard. I am not prejudiced; I am actually very open in this respect, I would say.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162340	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162342	Then I hope, if Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr is open to it, that she hears me say loud and clear that I disapprove of all kinds of violence, violence of honour, violence of women, just as Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr does, I take a clear and unequivocal stand against all women's violence that exists, regardless of the environment in which it exists. I disapprove of it bell-clearly, even though I am a Muslim, even though I am brown no matter what, I disapprove of it. I hope that I have made this clear once and for all here: I reject all forms of violence.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162419	Thank you. The next question is Mr. Sjúrður Skaale. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162422	Thank you. I usually stay out of domestic, Danish debates, but I think that the Free Greens are an interesting phenomenon, an interesting movement, and I would like to ask a question quite openly and without any controversy: who does the rapporteur think the Free Greens represent? How will the rapporteur describe the segment that the Free Greens represent in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162450	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162452	I hope that the Free Greens will represent all the young people who want much more climate action than what we are getting now. I hope that the Greens speak to young, strong women. I hope that the Greens will address all the grandparents who have seen how Denmark has developed in a direction which is wrong in relation to foreign policy. I hope that we represent all the minority citizens who are part of Denmark and who live here, work here, live here, but feel squeezed in the public debate. So I hope that we represent all the progressive voters who are out there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162533	Sjúrður Skaale, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162535	I'm just asking, because most people know more or less, so they don't hope, because they know who they represent. I know roughly who I represent, I hope not, because I know it simply. I ask, because there are some who would say that the Free Greens represent a very left-wing environment and a Muslim environment which, in some contexts, is not compatible. It is an open question, so there is no controversy about it. Is there anything about that? Are these two composite groups slightly different?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162606	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162607	We are a left-wing party, and we usually say that we are to the left of the Enhedslisten. We are an anti-establishment party, we want a completely different approach to our democracy. I was just talking about a democratic deficit, and I want far more citizens involved, much more codecision. I do not believe that there is any discrimination in being left-wing and that citizens with a Muslim background support one. I don't think there is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162640	Thank you. The next question is Mr. Morten Messerschmidt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162642	Sir. Sikandar Siddique wonders that he is being asked so many things about Islam and Muslims etc., but I have received a Ramadansong from Mr. Sikandar Siddique. It was issued on 1 April, but I do not think it was a April fool. When Mr. Sikandar Siddique in this way emits such a ramadansong, even to a mailbox that I did not even know existed, namely one called everyone in the Folketing, it then wonders in that light Mr. Sikandar Siddique, that he is also taken as a representative of Islam and Ramadan?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162721	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162723	I'm just thinking, sir. Bertel Haarder also sends out a Christmas song every year, but I have never heard Mr. Bertel Haarder get questions about his view of Christianity here on the Parliament's platform. At least I haven't heard. I'm just saying, guys, I think people notice it out there, and I really think it confirms the political struggle that I often try to address here. You just face the discrimination and discrimination, regardless of what level you find yourself in, whether it's out in society, or whether it's here in the Folketing. There is just another view of you when you are brown or Muslim, and I think that is very well expressed in this Chamber today. That's not what it was supposed to be about today, but suddenly it came to be about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162810	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162811	I myself have had the privilege of discussing Christianity with Mr. Bertel Haarder and done it here in Parliament, so I don't recognize it, sir. Sikandar Siddique says. On the other hand, I do not know anyone who cares as much about race, racism and discrimination as Mr. Sikandar Siddique. I think any Google or Infomedia search will confirm that. - Sir... Sikandar Siddique understand that when you talk so much about that issue yourself, then that is also what naturally calls for interest? And my real question is: is this really something that annoys Mr. Mr Sikandar Siddique is not interested in the specific group, Mr Siddique. Sikandar Siddique is trying to make a living by becoming a real Muslim party or immigrant party?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162846	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162847	Well, look again: here you just cut it all over a comb. I'm talking about minorities and Muslims. I'm not talking about Islam. Sir. Morten Messerschmidt rarely wants to hear me talk about Islam. I'm not talking about that. Will Mr. Morten Messerschmidt talks about Islam, he must have an imam. I am talking about the repression that, among other things, is being done. DF has been in charge for 20-25 years, of our Muslim minorities, of other minorities. That is what I am talking about here from the platform. The other is only something that fills with DF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162921	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Mai Villadsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405162924	I'm not gonna ask you about Mr. Knox. Sikandar Siddique's attitude towards violence and all sorts of other things, but perhaps Mr. Sikandar Siddique's own political like that, what can be said, awakening or development. I think we can agree entirely with the criticism we have together of the Social Democratic Party, but Mr. Sikandar Siddique himself has been a member of the Social Democratic Party until relatively recently. So what happened, what was it in the policy of the Social Democratic Party that did that Mr. Sikandar Siddique didn't want in anymore?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163003	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163004	That's an amazing question... great question. In 2009, it's been a very long time since I've been a Social Democrat... I volunteered at 22 years of age out of the Social Democratic Party. I wrote a letter to the then President Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and I wrote: Dear Helle. I simply resign from the Social Democratic Party because I cannot vouch for your right turn in the field of foreigners. It was in 2009. Then I wasn't a member of any party for 10 years, and then you know the rest of the story.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163039	Here you go, Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163040	Then I'd just like to invite Mr. Sikandar Siddique to change its Wikipedia page, where it says it was until the year 2018, which at least made me wonder why you could be on the journey so far and then stand with the attitudes that we share far along the way now. So that call has to be made from here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163100	Here you go, sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163104	I can say that it is simply factually wrong. It was 2009 that I resigned from the Social Democratic Party, and then I haven't been a member of any party for 10 years, and then I joined the Alternative, and then you know the rest of the story.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163117	Thank you, sir. Sikandar Siddique. The next party leader is sir. Torsten Gejl from the Alternative. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163127	Thank you, President. Yesterday, the United Nations Climate Panel came up with a report that gives us time for 2025 to get something done about the world's CO2 Unfortunately, the government and support parties in the recent Agriculture Agreement did not manage to save a single gram of CO2 but, in addition to CO2, if you look at the conditions that many animals, not all, but many animals live under in agriculture, I think you have to be very hard-skinned so as not to be appalled that we do not do very much about it. We will, for example: do not make a Danish ban, so we avoid that over 80%. of Danish hens break the sternum when laying eggs or that more than 90 per cent. of all piglets being tailed. We are ready to start up the mink industry again without even assessing the animal welfare situation and, in addition, we actually have a similar challenge with over 34,000 chinchillas, which we also keep in small cages. These are just some of the things we in the Alternative have been asking the Minister for Food about lately, and we have only just started. We are going to hear what the Minister thinks about 27,000 piglets dying a day in Danish pig production, that calves are taken from their mother under a day after birth, that so-called turbochicks are being produced, which are chickens for fattening, so fast that three-quarters of them have problems walking and we are going to ask about many other critical conditions in animal meat production. But it is difficult for us to stand up and be saved and say that it is too bad that not everyone is vegan and agriculture has not changed the conditions of the animals, because the vast majority of us are part of the problem. Personally, I am part of the culture that allows conditions in agriculture to be that way. After all, I have eaten meat for most of my life, and it is only now that I have really begun to phase out meat in my diet. It is only now that organisations such as World Animal Protection, Anima, the Danish Vegetarian Association, the Animal Protection and parties such as the Vegan Party have really succeeded in pushing animal welfare and animal rights into the herbal breeding of all of us and of young people in particular. That is why the time has come to ask: is this how it should be to be production animals in Denmark? Is this the final solution, or can we do better? Will we accept the suffering of animal production as consumers, as politicians, as human beings? The answer, of course, is no. We need to find ways to create better lives for the animals we produce, and I think time is ripe. I think this is gonna be the decade of the animals. I believe that the next ten years will be more about animal welfare. We need to ensure better conditions for animals in animal production. We do not do this by demonising farmers and chasing them from house to house; we do this by making political programmes that help agriculture to find the future markets where plant-based food is marketed and by supporting them in changing their forms of production.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163443	Thank you. The first question is Mrs Mai Villadsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163446	Thank you so much. And thank you for a speech that highlights a problem, I think we are discussing far too little in here. I believe and hope that Mr. Torsten Gejl is right in saying that this will be the decade of animals and that we will do something and change conventional farming so that so many animals will not be harmed. Thank you. We have in the Enhedslisten and the Alternative a common hoe with regard to Lynetteholmen, so I would like to ask, not about the funding, as Mr. Torsten Gejl has spoken a lot about, but for the storm flood protection itself. Because is it not true that there are a number of experts who are actually questioning whether what you are setting up is actually storm-flood-proofing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163529	Here you go, sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163531	Well, let's put it this way: we're really, really, really safe in a tiny dot in the harbour of Copenhagen. Oh, my God, it's gonna be stormproof there. On the other hand, we are likely to lack land for storm protection of various kinds up and down the coast. So I would say that the experts who challenge it are right. Sometimes you can think about whether it was really storm protection that was thought of or whether it was important to build a new big city out there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163600	Here you go, Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163602	Thank you. Summing up, it can be said that there are economic problems, that there are problems in relation to storm flood protection elsewhere, and that there are really major environmental problems, among others. with the sludge that is currently dumped in tons in the Bay of Køge. I can see, when I come to that, that there is not really a question in what I am saying, but just a statement that what is going on with Lynetteholmen is quite wrong, and that we together must try to do what we can to stop it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163630	Here you go, sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163632	We are, of course, very much in agreement with that. I think it looks as if the funding is crumbling, because so much land needs to be provided for funding, in that it is financed by receiving land, and it is almost totally unrealistic when we look forward. At the same time, the budget has been exceeded and it is difficult to get someone to take responsibility for it. So the question is whether we are actually looking forward to another huge scandal that is going to roll for many years.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163659	The next question is Mr. Morten Messerschmidt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163702	Thank you. I just have one small question, because I am in fact very much in agreement with it, as Mr. Torsten Gejl said about animal transportation. It's a case that I, among other things. The European Parliament had the privilege of working together with the current climate minister, Dan Jørgensen, to reduce transport time, but where the EU system was a persistent opponent. Then I'm just wondering why, sir. Torsten Gejl falls out to the opposite side, for I am among others. for that reason, against the European Union, and I understand that Mr. Torsten Gejl's party is a warm supporter of the EU. Why is that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163733	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163735	So this case probably doesn't make me join the Danish People's Party. However, there may well be areas where I agree that the European Union is muddy, because the animal transport is the most crazy thing, that is, the transport of animals so far so as to slaughter them, or whatever you do, and then transport them back again, is crazy. Right there we may have a common position, but that does not make me a total opponent of the European Union, because I simply cannot see how we are going to face global problems without having such a strong organisation as the European Union.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163805	Here you go, sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163807	I do not quite understand that, because the European Union is not something global. The European Union is only 27 countries and, moreover, countries which, compared with many other countries, are economically, and so on. It's getting smaller and smaller. So when animal welfare lies Mr. Torsten Gejl so much at heart, which it also does for the Danish People's Party, why is one so willing to accept it in order to have an institution that will not be the driving force in solving the problem of climate change? Why not do the same as the Enhedslisten, who, as I understand it, is looking for more global institutions when it comes to climate change, but who also takes the consequence of animal welfare and says that the European Union is a bad thing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163843	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163845	Well, there are many things we can do at home when it comes to animal welfare. In other words, almost all the things I mentioned, we can deal with Danish legislation. To the issue of the European Union: when I say that we have global challenges, it is because the major global problems we, for example, face. now in Ukraine, or when it comes to drugs or many other things, do not have passports. These are precisely global and major problems that I think should be met by a stronger organisation, and that organisation is the European Union. And I don't see anything better. In other words, such cooperation between England and Norway etc. I think I'm gonna be too small to have the fighting power that it takes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163918	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Pernille Vermund. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163920	Thank you for that, and thank you for speaking about animal welfare despite the very serious issues, which are, moreover, essential to discuss at the moment. I would like to hear about the alternative's relationship with animal welfare when it comes to rewilding. For me, the alternative has helped to vote in favour of the law on national parks. Part of that law is that you have given the Minister for the Environment the right and the possibility to dispense with the Animal Protection Act. How can this be linked to the desire for better animal welfare?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163953	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405163954	Thank you for that question. That, among other things. We are talking about the fact that we would like to postpone horse flocks on land that is immense, thousands of hectares. They must live as independently as possible, and they must become as wild as they can now. It's for an animal protection fighter like me, a dream scenario. Flocks of horses on huge large plazas, which can live their own life summer as winter. That is why I will not demand that each horse be inspected every day. I think it would just scare the hell out of them if we were to follow them with a jeep and do it every day. So that's why.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164034	Here you go, Mrs. Pernille Vermund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164036	Has the rapporteur seen any of the horses and some of the cattle which have been exposed and which have not received any extra feed in the winter? They are completely emaciated. They wear large open wounds. That is precisely the consequence of the law that has been passed, namely the right of the Ministry of the Environment to grant derogations from the Animal Protection Act. It is quite crazy that animals on government land are being treated worse than we are demanding from private or farmers, by the way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164106	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164108	Thank you for your attention on animal welfare. No national parks have yet been created, so it cannot be said that these conditions have produced any results in national parks. What we are doing is a management plan to ensure that the size of the park matches the number of animals. If it turns out there's gonna be a particularly hard winter, then we're gonna have to take animals out. There must be no hunger in the Danish national parks, and we must help to ensure this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164135	The next question is Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164138	I just got so fond of Mr. Torsten Gejl's focus on animal welfare and, in fact, also for the answer about rewilding, because some of what we need is the more nature in Denmark it is more coherent nature, it is wild animals. It's kind of crazy, 'cause we're such a grown-up country. But I would really like to ask about the issue of coastal protection, because in Denmark we have, in general, always had a discussion about whether we should not make such a map for coastal protection. I kind of agree that we have to do this all over Denmark, but what does the alternative envisage, so we have to do with, for example. Copenhagen as a city, if we're not going to make Lynetteholmen? I'd really like to know what you're thinking. Is that a dam? Or what is it that you want to shore-ensure Copenhagen?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164217	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164219	It's a big, big question to answer in a few seconds. Well, you could do that coast protection right in that area with Lynetteholmen without also building a city. You can do it with dikes, and you can do it with, what can you say, a wall, without having to build a huge city behind it. It may be necessary to make dikes, for example. up and down the coast, but I'm not an expert on coast protection. I have to confess.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164247	Here you go, Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164249	The reason I ask is that I am genuinely curious, because we have looked into what could be done for Copenhagen, and some of the things that lie in the project Lynetteholmen are not, of course, automatically said that there should be a city. Actually, it hasn't been decided yet. What has been decided is that we are making an island, and that is precisely to get that coastal protection. Then I think we will have a lot of discussions on infrastructure in this regard and on how much urban development there should be, and something like that. There I think there will be a number of different points of view. But I still can't see what we're going to see into Copenhagen. If we get a water rise of 2 or 3 m in the harbour of Copenhagen, it will have quite a major impact on our city and also on some of the nature we have. So I just want to hear your ideas about what we could do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164324	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164325	Well, in this particular case, we can be coastproof where Lynetteholmen should lie, without using a lot of land to build a really, really big city. So the little bit of coast protection is fine. It's just a shame to use land that may need to be used elsewhere to make that city. While the Minister for Transport was talking about the island of Lynetteholm, the Minister for Housing stood somewhere else in Copenhagen and talked about the city to be built there. I would be delighted if the SF would help ensure that the city does not come, but it is politically connected as far as I can see.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164402	Thank you, sir. Torsten Gejl. There are no more brief remarks, so... hey, sorry. Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164410	Yes, allow me to return to the question I have raised, including to some of the other rapporteurs. As I see it, there is broad support in general for us to move forward now in relation to renewable energy, both for the sake of the climate. I know the alternative will agree with you, but also for the sake of security, in other words that we must ensure independence from Russian gas. How does the alternative deal with the dilemma that we know is coming just around the corner now, namely that if we are to have much more renewable energy, in some situations it could collide with other considerations, for example. In the environmental field, is there a difficult dilemma?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164442	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164446	Now I do not know the specific example to which Mrs Mette Frederiksen refers, but it is sometimes a balance, for example. Can the national parks cost CO2 Other places is the question: should you sacrifice a little biodiversity to get more alternative energy? And that is where you have to go pragmatically and find a way every time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164512	Well, then I'll say thank you to Mr. Knox. Torsten Gejl. The next rapporteur is Mrs Aaja Chemnitz Larsen from IA.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164526	Much has been said today and it has been a long debate, so I would really like to start a positive and slightly uplifting place. The Prime Minister also mentioned that there has been a new coalition in Greenland, and I think this is very positive. For some of what we are calling for in Greenland is political stability and that we focus on the ball and there will be some political calm to focus on the political issues. So I certainly have great hopes that this cooperation can lift something in relation to Greenlandic society. Having said that, of course we are also following the situation with Ukraine, and while we are here talking about how we think the world can get better, we know that the world could not be worse for a very large group, namely Ukraine. And as a Greenlandic parliamentarian, I cannot help worrying about how the situation can develop in the Arctic, not least because Russia is 40 per cent old. of the Arctic area, but also because of Greenland's size and location. For Russia is a player in the Arctic, but with the war in Ukraine we cannot continue cooperation with Russia for now. At the same time, I also have a peace of mind because we stand with Denmark because we are a community of nations and therefore we are also part of NATO. The kingdom community is in many ways heading towards a crossroads, and it fills a lot in the political landscape of both countries, Greenland and Denmark. I also feel a sincere interest from the government in starting to see Greenland more equal, not least in political work, and I am very hopeful and very grateful for that. The good relationship must be cultivated, and we must develop it where we also know that obstacles can still exist. We need to learn more about each other and we need to look at each other in order to continue the good cooperation and continue the community in the coming years. Most Greenlandic children at home know a lot about Denmark, but vice versa we know that many Danish children, young people and adults do not know very much about Greenland. And as long as it continues to be so, we also know that there are prejudices and there is discrimination, and we believe that this needs to be changed, both in schools and in the media, and we have also presented this to the government. And what I'm meeting with is kind of an responsiveness. But that sensitivity must be translated into action. I believe that together we can create better decisions for a future relationship between Greenland and Denmark, which will be even better than what is today. I also see a government that is humble to its own history and even more humble than it has been in the past. The apology to the experimental children is a very good example of it: one dares look the dark chapters in the eyes. We know that the same applies to legal orphans, and here I hope that the government will be just as humble and give them the recognition, the excuse and the compensation they deserve as much as they deserve. Thank you for the floor. Qujanaq.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164851	Thank you. The first brief remark is to Mrs Mai Villadsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164854	Thank you so much. Thank you for your speech, and also congratulations to the new government constellation. I would really like to ask about the green transition and Greenland. This is something we both have to focus on for the time being because of various television programmes, but it should also be very much focused on, because in Greenland you are hit so hard and so violently by the climate change that there are, but of course you have also put the policy on, at least as I understand it now, and support the Paris Agreement. So I would really like to hear, also in the light of the new constellation: Are there any new things on the drawing board in relation to the green transition?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164936	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405164938	Thank you very much. I see a very straight green line, you might say, in Greenland's policy, where we have much more focus on precisely being sustainable something further forward by putting the climate ahead. In Greenland it is very political that drives the green agenda, but it doesn't really matter as long as something happens. Among other things: When the Prime Minister was in Greenland, an agreement was reached to look at the financing, also from the Danish side, of even more hydropower and green energy in Greenland, and I think that is a good way to go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165009	Mrs. Mai Villadsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165011	Absolutely. I also hope that Mrs Aaja Chemnitz Larsen will share the rest of the Danish Parliament if there is something or some areas where we should cooperate much more in relation to green conversion and development; of course we have also had the discussion in relation to research cooperation. Another question I have is about knowledge about Greenland, because, as the rapporteur also said, much is told and explained at school in Greenland, but not so much at home. What does the rapporteur think we can do to disseminate more knowledge about Greenland to children, young people and adults in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165051	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165053	Thank you very much. I would really like a link between the green and the blue, i.e. to create sustainable economic development, because Greenland also needs that, and I see Denmark playing a role there too. So I'd like to try to elaborate on that when I have a few seconds to do it. But what we really want to see is that Danish young people both in primary and secondary school get some knowledge about Greenland and not just about the historical, because it thus helps to regenerate prejudices. And when you are faced with questions about whether you live in igloos or ride on polar bears, which are real questions that are asked to Greenlanders, we have a knowledge gap, we have to fill out, and which is very much a Danish task. And I believe that if we have children and young people as a strategic focus, also in relation to future relations between Greenland and Denmark, both in schools and in the media, we can also go a very long way in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165143	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165145	I would like to ask a few questions about the Arctic more generally and perhaps especially military at the moment. With Russia's rumble in the world and aggression against Ukraine, it is also Greenland that has a border with Russia. So far, the focus of the Greenland Government has been on low-voltage and I certainly understand that as well, but how does IA view a future with a very aggressive Russia on the other side? Do you also start to consider security policy what this could mean for Greenland?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165221	Thank you, here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165222	Thank you for the question. I think that this is really one of the most important questions to ask in this time, because much of the knowledge we get in the Folketing is not necessarily gained in Inatsisartut, so I really think that at home in Greenland there is a knowledge gap, in relation to what Russia does around the world, and not just that you get knowledge about the Arctic. So we also need to keep up with the war in Ukraine, because what Russia is doing elsewhere around the world is also something we need to have much more attention around. So I am calling for more discussions on defence policy at home in Greenland, both in public schools, but at least in high schools and where we can somehow have it incorporated in general into Greenlandic society. We need to talk much more about it and we need to know much more than we do today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165311	Here you go, Mrs. Pia Olsen Dyhr.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165312	Thank you, and thank you for our parties' very, very good and long friendship and cooperation. I have been very happy about that, including as party chairman. And I would like to say that some of what I can at least see in both places is, of course, that discussion of security policy is much higher on the agenda. How do you view the whole question of NATO in Greenland? You have the Americans present in Thule, too, is it being updated right now?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165339	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165341	First of all, I would like to say that Greenland and, as such, the Faroe Islands are also shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the West, and this is something I think is extremely important to bear in mind. There have not been those discussions, whether that is what we should or should not do, even in spite of it may hit our economy extremely hard. So I think that is a good thing. I think we need to distinguish between NATO presence and Danish presence in Greenland, because this is about trying to maintain this low-voltage. That is what we all want to do in relation to the Arctic, and we need to do very wisely, but unfortunately time does not allow for a major analysis of a very complex but important issue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165422	Thank you. The next speaker is Mrs Mette Frederiksen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165425	In fact, I think that many good things were said both in the introduction and also here in the answers; of course, first and foremost, the very clear emphasis that Greenland is standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the West; that is what is absolutely crucial with the situation we find ourselves in today. But I also took note of something that I would actually call for us to think further about in the Danish Parliament, namely that if we stress first and foremost the historical ties in the Kingdom community in educational contexts and in information contexts and in general in the desire to bring our three countries closer together, then we can really reproduce some of what we do not therefore have to seek an increased knowledge of the Kingdom Community between the three countries in terms of current circumstances; that is also a very, very important point.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165515	Thank you, here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165517	Thank you very much. And perhaps the most important point is that you also have to teach modern Greenland. That is the reflection I see when I come here and get met by some, what to say, ignorant questions. Then I don't feel at all seen in terms of how I see myself as Greenlander. I got the most votes in the six largest places around Greenland, and I also see myself as a big city Greenlander, and I think that Greenland is extremely good at having both the traditional and the modern and the Nuuk. Well, you can work in a high-rise in the morning and go hunting in the afternoon. It's very natural in Greenland. Compared to some of these photos, I think there's a lot to pick up. Young people need to know more about each other in general.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165604	Here you go, Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165606	I think this is a very, very interesting discussion, because I also want us to put the bar high. In recent years, we have begun to reform our Commonwealth in order to achieve a greater degree of equality and respect for a new contact committee with regard to foreign policy and a number of other decisions. In it is also a necessary dispute with some of the things that lie in our history, because if we do not dare to face it and acknowledge and acknowledge the mistakes that have been made and serious mistakes that have had a high human cost, then I do not think that we will reach where we have an equal and respectful relationship. But if we do this at the same time, I very, very much agree that it is modern Greenland that the Danes must relate to, because it is Greenland that you experience and see, not least when you visit.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165650	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165653	Thank you very much. I agree very much. One of the things I want to say is that in relation to many of the cases in the Danish Parliament, I have a little idea that Greenland is waiting for Denmark and Denmark may in fact be waiting for Greenland. I think that this discussion is about whether it is Greenland or Denmark that should take an initiative for a change of law. And what do we actually do when it's a shared responsibility? I believe that Greenland also needs to sit a little more in the driver's shirt, compared to what we really want, because it is primarily in our interest to ensure that the legislation is updated and that it is in the areas that we are concerned with. So it is also just as much to say that if we build a bridge, it is also both sides that must do their job and take a little more responsibility.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165733	Thank you. The next question is Mr. Edmund Joensen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165736	Thank you. Last week, the Faroes' layman and party leader visited IA's party leader and chairman, and as far as I have heard, they had a good talk about relevant matters of different kinds. They also talked about cooperation between the Faroe Islands and Greenland. So my question to the rapporteur is: how will the rapporteur propose better cooperation between Greenland and the Faroe Islands?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165834	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165835	Thank you very much. In practice, I think that we in the Danish Parliament have a responsibility to try to work together as well, and I think it is very good that the lagman visited Greenland here last week and that an agreement was reached. Because as much as Denmark needs to know more about Greenland and also about the Faroe Islands, we also need to know more about each other internally between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. From a Greenlandic perspective, I think that we have a lot to learn from the Faroe Islands, among others. on the use of fisheries, whole fisheries, fisheries management and general economic growth. So these are some of the very specific areas on which I see we should cooperate more.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165915	Thank you. A follow-up question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165917	I miss cooperation directly between the Faroe Islands and Greenland. I am sure that a great deal of progress could be made. There are lots of Faroeses who know the conditions in Greenland, have sailed in Greenland, have fished in Greenland, have made extensions in Greenland. So Greenland would probably benefit greatly from such cooperation. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165948	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405165950	Thank you. I totally agree. In addition, it can also be said that we, together between the Sambands party and the IA, were allocated 3 million. kr. that DUF, Danish Youth Council, together with Greenlandic and Faroese associations, can ensure more knowledge about Greenland and the Faroe Islands in Denmark. And I think this young-to-youth cooperation is very important. We have also jointly, all four North Atlantic mandates, been allocated 27 million. kr. to a film pool dealing with Greenland and the Faroe Islands. I think we should be much better at working together in this House, in other words where we agree.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170024	Thank you to Mrs Aaja Chemnitz Larsen. There are no more brief comments. The next speaker is Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170038	Thank you. Qujanaq. This is an extended party leader debate I am not the chairman of the party Siumut, but yet I stand here and speak for my party, which has its headquarters in Nuuk and, incidentally, has returned to government coalition after a year's break and now in cooperation with Inuit Ataqatigiit. This shows the pragmatic approach to policy in Greenland. Where we faced each other just a year ago, our two parties now agree to disagree and stand together about Greenland during a difficult time in the history of the world. This characterises our people and our culture, and in the party that I represent today, Siumut, a party with a social democratic ideology, we believe that right and duty go hand in hand. We believe in co-responsibility and that we must all have the strength to preserve the community that exists in our country. But above all, we also believe in democracy, and now, with war in Europe, it is the faith in democracy, peace and freedom that fills today's party leader debate. It is therefore also very relevant that we also ensure the strengthening of democracy in the Danish Kingdom. When, for example, you know... Back in January 2019, the party leader debate was once again forgot on the Danish side, in Danish politics, to draw the North Atlantic realities into the creation of this extended party leader debate. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is a symptom of a fundamental problem in the form of a lack of parliamentary involvement. We have a reality where the Danish kingdom is incredibly complex, and before we end up revolutionising everything, we must also allow room for the complexity and room for the democratic processes now more than ever before. Everything Siumut has fought for since the party was founded is becoming more and more focused and not just within the kingdom; it is attitudes that are growing on a global level. We have never deviated from that policy of more self-determination or our belief in and trust in the Greenlandic people. Some Greenlandic parties have said that they had the same faith, but have acted differently, even here in the Danish Parliament, but with the new spirit of time and the new coalition collaboration in Greenland it becomes more relevant than ever before to keep in mind that the Greenlandic people can and will speak for themselves. Various Greenlandic parties, which have been in agreement, have later deviated from this position, but one thing is certain: it is in Siumut firmly established, and that is what we are going to mention time and time again in the Folketing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170327	Thank you very much. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Morten Messerschmidt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170331	Thank you for your speech, and especially thank you for repeatedly stressing that Denmark is a kingdom. I like that. What I just want to ask is the assumption here that there should be discrimination or discrimination, so that the rapporteur's party chairman cannot take part today. I would just like to remind you that there was also a period in which the Chairman of the Conservative People's Party is not here right now, he is legally sorry that he was not a member of the Folketing, and he could not participate either. So it is not the case that the same rules apply both to the North Atlantic mandates and to the Danish mandates, and how can this be discrimination?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170410	Here you go. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170411	The word discrimination has not emerged at this early stage. We are talking here about a democratic parliamentary deficit. Right now we have a cooperation between governments, as stated in the Self-Government Act on precisely the cooperation between Greenland and Denmark. But it has not been established how the various parliaments within the Kingdom are to cooperate, and that is what we repeatedly criticise, among other things. by also making various concrete proposals, such as: that you can create a Parliamentary Council so that you can make a connection.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170445	Here you go, sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170447	Well, I think it sounds extremely exciting if you can make a body where the three parliaments in the Kingdom community can meet. I would think that was exciting to develop. What I'm arresting is why, after all, we had to change the practice of this institution. In fact, I believe that this also applies to the Alternative, I was just whispered in my ear at least for a period of time that the party's chairman was not a member of the Folketing and therefore could not participate in these debates. Why change the institution's practice instead of just saying that the same rules apply to everyone, whether you are elected in Greenland or in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170521	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170522	I think that if you want to use the word the Danish Kingdom, you can keep using that word instead of the word the Commonwealth. However, I agree that the same legislation must of course be maintained for everyone. But here, too, I have noticed that when you, for example... If you are a minister but not an elected official, you will still have the opportunity to speak from the Parliamentary Chamber and to speak in different ways. Here I am just trying to point out that the Greenlandic party leaders are also parliamentary elected, just somewhere else from the kingdom, but we are still under the Danish state technically. So how does it work with our cooperation when it is that our party leader cannot act as party leader in party leader debates for the kingdom? That is what I am trying to point out.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170607	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mr. Torsten Gejl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170610	I'd like to give you a little backup. I think we should get this sorted out. In other words, ministers who are not members of the Folketing can stand on that platform. We also see that other people elected in other political forums can. So if there is a great desire to be represented by his party leader before the other party leaders in the same kingdom community, then I think we should at least try to resolve it. There are harder things than what we've solved in this floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170638	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170639	Well, I also hope for some kind of support for a solution that we can all agree on. At any rate, I think it is important that we try to keep in mind that we are Members of Parliament, but we are not party leaders, and it is also important that the party leaders get this speaking time when it is that the opportunity is there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170702	Thank you very much to Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam. Is there another brief comment? Yes, here you go, Mrs. Mette Frederiksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170707	Thank you. Now I have just had the opportunity to stay for several days in Greenland, among others. in Ilulissat, and when you are there, which is probably one of the most beautiful places on the planet at all, then climate change is nothing future. This is not something that we are discussing is going to happen. The ice has melted, it has retreated. It's different. Climate change is there with potentially real, very big consequences. After all, we take this very seriously in Denmark with our climate legislation and everything we are doing together, and I am also very pleased that we in the Kingdom Community are increasingly focusing on climate change. But can I not ask here what the rapporteur has of further reflections in terms of Greenland's eyes and glasses?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170754	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170755	I would say that this is an incredibly good cooperation that is being created under the auspices of the Prime Minister and the Greenland Government at this time, because Mrs Mette Frederiksen also said earlier that energy policy is also a security policy and that the two things are linked and that we also need to look at it as a long-term problem to solve. But within Greenland, especially in youth circles, much is also looked at how we can make food more sustainable, so that we do not always have to have food, for example. vegetables all the way from Europe to Greenland, by creating new entrepreneurial opportunities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170839	We thank Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam. The next speaker is Mr. Edmund Joensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405170900	President, thank you for the floor and thank you for a good debate today. The world is in a tragic situation. There is war in Europe, something that we thought belonged to the past. It is no secret that for decades the Faroe Islands have had a good trade relationship with Russia, and also that the Faroe Islands have not always made the right foreign policy decisions when there have been conflicts in the world. We have simply been too naive, but now I am convinced that we have come on the right track and see that we have to act, so to speak, to join the West clearly. The Faroese Government has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on several occasions. The government has announced that it wants to impose the same sanctions on Russia as the EU does, knowing that our economic losses are much greater than those of many other countries. It has consequences to have a stand. It costs to protect democratic values. Much of our exports have in recent years gone to Russia and we have to say today that we have been too dependent on Russian trade cooperation. It is of great importance that the Faroe Islands develop trade relations and strengthen cooperation with countries based on their values and democracy and freedoms, first and foremost with the European Union. We are entering a new age in a security policy context. The Faroe Islands' position must no longer be characterised by a distance from security and defence policy, and we must get away from knowing nothing consciously. The Faroe Islands have been given an important role on the international stage, and our strategic position in the North Atlantic also puts the Faroe Islands in a key position. Let me make it clear: the Faroe Islands are not for sale for the highest bidder. We are, and must remain, a united part of the West and NATO. NATO is our safety net in the current situation, and the Kingdom Community is the guarantor of this security. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171214	Thank you very much. The first brief remark is to Mrs Mette Frederiksen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171217	Thanks for a really nice speech. As the rapporteur knows, I am incredibly pleased that the Faroe Islands have so clearly sided with the West on this issue. It is necessary that we all do so and that we sort of do away with ourselves at such a critical time in our history, how we then place ourselves in the right place. So thank you for the Faroe Islands doing so. I also know that the rapporteur is very concerned about this, too, in the question of how to secure better trade agreements with operators other than Russia in order also to secure independence or, at least, greater independence. So can I not just hear about what further consideration is there in this context?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171300	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171301	Thank you and thank you for your comments. It is quite true, as has been said, that free markets are very important and we have too much of trade tied to Russia. It has been almost a quarter of our exports. But should we stop it? I saw that they had as a headline on the radio.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171336	The next question is for Mr. Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171341	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur for the speech. I visited the Faroe Islands and Sambandsflockkurin here a few weeks ago and thank you for last, it was cozy and some of the things we talked about were by nature the sanctions against Russia, and as Mr. Edmund Joensen also says that in the Faroe Islands exports to Russia have been heavily tied up. One of the things I have particularly noticed is a great Faroese salmon exporter who says: we have to stop this, our values offer us that. So it is said that it cannot go on. What other markets are we talking about, what access to the Faroe Islands should be opened up, and what will it mean for the Faroe Islands to have increased access to the European market?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171430	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171431	We can say it very briefly today. The Faroe Islands export almost exclusively raw materials. If it's not raw materials, it's fish fillets. It is because we do not have the open trade agreement with the EU market, but we want to be a part of those who sold to this big market that has 500 million people. We have one of the world's best fish, we have half a million tonnes of the world's best fish, so it is both a disadvantage for us not to be able to sell finished products to the EU, but it is also a disadvantage for EU citizens not to be able to eat the best fish.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171530	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mr. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171533	The Faroe Islands played a central role through NATO during the Cold War. I believe it was at Sornfelli that there was a special radar that provided information to the Americans and our NATO allies in the broad sense. I therefore regard the Faroe Islands as a country which is very committed to NATO, and that is also what I hear, Mr President. Edmund Joensen say. That is why it is exciting to hear what ideas are being made, both by Mr Beyer de Ryke and others. Joensen, his party, but also in a broad sense in the Faroe Islands, in relation to the referendum on 1 June, if the EU parties get what they want, and an increasing proportion of Denmark's military commitment must go through the EU, of which the Faroe Islands are not a member.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171620	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171622	Firstly, I would like to say that it is not a debate that is taking place in the Faroe Islands, i.e. whether you have that reservation in Denmark or whether you do not have it. It is my feeling that it does not matter very much whether it is one way or the other. That's what I think.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171654	Good. There are no more brief comments, so we thank Mr. Edmund Joensen. The next speaker is Mr. Sjúrður Skaale. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405171702	Thank you. Solomon, the son of David, the king of Jerusalem, still speaks in the book of Ecclesiastes of the Old Testament into our time and politics. He also talks about the radar to be deployed in the Faroe Islands and to be part of NATO's early warning system. The radar will give us more knowledge, and as we know, Solomon says that the greater the wisdom, the greater the anguish, the greater the person who increases his knowledge, the greater his pain. A new report from the Center for Military Studies states that increased surveillance risks making us aware of Russian activity. Rissians are a very accurate description of the Scriptural dilemma; knowledge is at risk, for with knowledge comes distress and pain. According to British sources, the Royal Air Force has, over the last 17 years, taken out Russian aircraft approaching British airspace from the north, i.e. where the Faroe Islands are located. But when I've asked the government if these planes have been in Faroese airspace, you have the answer: probably not. And you've been able to answer that because you haven't seen them. What has been out of sight has also been out of our mind. I could look up into the air and say with old Solomon: endless emptiness, endless emptiness, everything is vanity. Knowing that this may not have been the case. When someone wants to see a plane on the upcoming radar screen, they'll say, "Look, here's something new, a military plane." Solomon's wise voice is heard again. If anyone says, "Look, here's something new, what we see before our eyes has already been there long ago." We probably knew about the planes. We just haven't proved it. We have been able to keep it behind some curtains that consisted of uncertainty. The radar will remove the curtains from the window facing the Faroese sky, and what do we do on the day we can see a strange metal bird of prey up in the blue? Are we prepared to accept the anguish, the pain and the task that the truth can bring? How will we react to an alien, hostile aircraft in Faroese airspace, and who will do so? Does anyone know about this? Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172014	Thank you. The first brief remark is to Mrs Mette Frederiksen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172018	Thank you for a speech which, as always, is interesting from the rapporteur, in which, I think, there were both hints and expressions, but also some questions, and now I want to call for some answers. If I understand what is being said, there is also a recognition that the new security policy situation, which we can all observe after 24 February, also applies to the Faroe Islands. But what is the consequence of that? What is the rapporteur's view of the new security policy situation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172057	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172058	The rapporteur is seriously looking at it, and that is why the rapporteur also supports one hundred per cent that a radar is being set up, that is clear, and I have been involved in many debates on it in order to get the resolution to go in the right direction. But what I'm calling for is an answer to what to do when we get information I don't know what to do about it. Is it the British who have to do something? There are no military aircraft in the Faroe Islands, so who will expel flights from a Faroese airport? We simply do not know that. So we've said a, you have to say b.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172135	The next brief remark is from Mr. Morten Messerschmidt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172137	First of all, I would like to thank you for an excellent speech, which was a reflection of the great dilemmas that we are all currently facing. However, I am also pleased that Mr. Sjúrður Skaale comes to the conclusion that you want to know something and not just keep in ignorance, so that you do not know what dangers may be lurking. Sir. Sjúrður Skaale asks the question: Who should you call? I would like to ask a counter-question: who would Mr. Sjúrður Skaale be most comfortable with Washington D.C., London or the European Commission?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172208	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172210	As I said in my speech, the British Air Force has been on its wings 136 times to expel Russian aircraft. That's why the most obvious thing is that it's London you call.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172227	Thank you very much, sir. Sjúrður Skaale. There are no more brief comments. The next speaker is Mr. Alex Vanopslagh of the Liberal Alliance. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172238	Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen and party leaders, I am making one message today, and that is: fear not, do not be afraid. I think you know what I'm talking about. I am talking about the paralysis and apathy that has affected parts of the Folketing and the government as a result of this overriding fear. It is an anxiety that eats up our courage and our visions, and that consumes our power of action and makes us unable to do the right but difficult things. It is, of course, the electoral and reform anxiety that I am talking about. It is an fear we see when there is no courage to find the money for the defence, even if you would like to bask in saying that you want to spend the money. It is an fear of the electorate that we see when we are faced with a huge shortage of labour, but for fear of certain groups of voters we do not solve the problems. It is the electoral anxiety we see when the public sector is sandy in bureaucracy, in the absence of innovation, in the absence of competition, but for fear of a large public trade union movement, nothing is being done about it. Jean-Claude Juncker has to be careful not to quote the words 'we know what needs to be done, we just do not know how to be re-elected afterwards'. And I think that the fear of electors and the fear of reform has always been a widespread disease in politics, but I don't think the disease has ever had as much hold on Danish politics as it has now. Throughout my lifetime, governments have defied fear and have jumped into the frightening, but meaningful, rewarding and wise reform work that should make Denmark a better country in the future. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen defied the fear of being accused of a breach of his promise and intervened in the payroll. Anders Fogh Rasmussen was always afraid not to sound, look like and act like a social democrat, but he found the courage for the great welfare agreement in 2006. Lars Løkke Rasmussen took the boxes to reform both cash benefits and early retirement. The Helle Thorning-Schmidt government conducted a wise policy. They themselves called it the policy of necessity with lower top tax and lower corporation tax. I even remember that the then Minister for Employment, Mette Frederiksen, made some wise changes to the cash assistance system. And the VLAK government also tried, but lacked support. It was not the courage that was lacking, it was the 90 mandates. If you look at this government and the majority that is now in the Folketing, you might ask: what has been accomplished by forms that significantly increase the supply of labour and really do do something about the productivity of the public sector and ensure the future of the welfare society? Well, absolutely nothing worth writing about or going into the history books. So, ladies and gentlemen, let us regain the courage for the reforms. Significant reforms are needed to make it better worthwhile to work and to make us more prosperous in the future. Significant reforms are needed to ensure that welfare is provided in the future on the terms of the citizens and not on the basis of the system. It is only if we have the courage to defy the electoral anxiety and the courage to change Denmark that we can create a better Denmark in the future. So that's my call.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172534	Thank you. The first brief remark is to Mrs Mette Frederiksen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172538	Thank you for your speech, which, unfortunately, I do not have enough seconds to really go into, so I will really go on with something quite different, something we mentioned earlier in the debate. If I understand correctly, the political leader recommends a yes on 1 June, and if I remember correctly, a no was recommended the last time we went to a referendum, at least on the part of the party. Can the rapporteur not just tell us what kind of journey you have been on or what has created the change from a 'no' to a 'yes'?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172608	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172610	Our policy has always been to maintain the reservation of law and the reservation of the euro, and it has always been to abolish the reservation of defence. After all, we are not such a party that says that everything from the European Union is good, and then we have to say yes or that everything from the European Union is junk and we have enough in ourselves in Denmark. So we take a stand on a case-by-case basis, and I think it is obviously in Denmark's interest to abolish the defence reserve. This prevents us from participating in joint military operations in which we may have a sense of duty to participate, and we must, of course, have the opportunity to fulfil that obligation. I am annoyed that the debate is muddled by talk here about an EU that does not exist and will not exist. And it really upsets me that the yes side often says that it is about joining the heart of Europe. No, it's just about being able to participate in common defence cooperation. That is a good idea and, of course, we must do it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172651	The next brief remark is to Mrs Mai Villadsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172654	Thank you. I would also like to comment on the speech, which was almost a mere horror seen with Enhedslisten's glasses, but I shouldn't do that. Nevertheless, I will try to embark on something a little more ideological, as I appreciate the fact that the President of the Liberal Alliance often does too, and talk about profit on welfare. After all, there is something we disagreed about, and we had a debate a few weeks ago, which we did not really get settled. So I would like to hear: is there no limit to how much profit one has to draw from our welfare, that is, how much one has to earn from welfare, if one asks the Liberal Alliance?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172730	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172731	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172733	Here you go to Mrs Mai Villadsen for a follow-up question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172735	Thank you. That was an enormously concrete answer. You could say that, seen with my glasses, you shouldn't be able to pull out any profit at all. You can make money as a school manager for a free school or as a teacher, or whatever, but no profit should be made. In fact, I think that there is a case that highlights it quite specifically: the crisis centres, where a lot of crisis centres have come together and have complained to the public and politicians about the people who come in now and without proper professionalism, but just to make money, are preying on violenced women and children. Does the Liberal Alliance really think it should make a great profit?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172815	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172817	The Liberal Alliance believes that there should be so much competition in welfare areas that such an offer would go bankrupt, rather tomorrow than later than that. There is also another good example that Enhedslisten's policy is harmful to Denmark • I don't know what the appropriate word is for it, but I think it's a kind word for it is Dagmarsminde, the private dementia care home, which is extremely popular. I believe that all of us who have seen the documentary on Dagmarsminde were incredibly touched. It has cost millions of dollars to build up Dagmarsminde. They had a modest surplus last year of 0.5 million. kr., and therefore the consequence of Enhedslisten's policy is that they must be forcibly closed, i.e. because they have a small profit. I think this is very damaging to the well-being of the Danes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405172852	We thank Alex Vanopslagh and the Liberal Alliance. There are no more on the list of speakers, which means that this item is over. Before we move on to the next point, we need to get everyone back to their normal places, and then the meeting will continue in a moment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173039	The debate is open, and the first to speak is Mrs Paulin from the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173113	Thank you. The bill that we are discussing today is about heat checks and about giving a targeted handshake to the Danes who feel the rising energy prices the hardest. It is not a perfect law that makes all the current challenges of rising inflation and high energy prices disappear, but it is a noticeable helping hand to approx. 419,000 households. The heat check is targeted households with an income of less than DKK 650,000 and has gas pine, district heating with a high gas share or electricity or electric heating. These energy sources have been chosen because it is the warming methods that have increased most in price. The income limit has been set on the basis that the check should be targeted at those households where rising energy prices affect the daily budget most. It goes without saying that if aid were to be given to everyone without any distinction to income, the amount would end up being significantly lower and the effect would also be considerably lower. The same can also be said of some of the alternative proposals that have been on the table, such as spending 2.7 billion. kr. to lower electricity taxes for all Danes. For a household with a consumption of about 3,000 kWh per year, this would mean an annual saving of just under DKK 1,000. For those who are in greatest need of heat help, 1,000 kroner would be needed. didn't reach very far. Here I am pleased that the heat check of DKK 6,000 has been adjusted. will be of real importance, although far from being able to cover the rising prices. Unfortunately, we are looking into a time when our economy is challenged by the violent events we are witnessing with Russia's nasty war in Ukraine. We are about to switch energy supply chains into which we are part at an unprecedented rate, because it is absolutely untenable that Europe should be as dependent as we are on Russian gas, oil and coal. We have to get out of this. Inflation has returned as a phenomenon. Energy and fuel prices are high and we are also looking into a potential global food crisis which can become a reality within a few months. We feel the consequences, and keeping the Danes completely free from the cost of inflation would cost more than 38 billion. kr. That is not possible, but we can and we must help those who are hit the hardest, and that is exactly what we are doing with the hot-check bill, which the Social Democrats naturally support.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173340	Thank you. There is a technical problem up here, so I would like to say to the rapporteurs that if you wish to speak briefly, you can raise your hand until we make the technique work again. Mrs. Marie Bjerre, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173354	Thank you. I've gotten myself down here, too. The rapporteur says that it is not a perfect arrangement that has been made here, and I must agree with the rapporteur. For example, the heating check will not take account of the size of the household, i.e. whether you have children, whether you are a provider or whether you are a student. And there must be a difference in the amount of heat you need. Nor does it take into account what it is for a property, i.e. whether it is an old villa property that costs something more to heat up or whether it is a brand new property. I would therefore like to hear from the rapporteur whether other payment models have been considered.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173433	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173434	We've been around a lot in the discussion on how to give this heating aid there have been different models. And it's complicated because it's different parameters that have to be run together in different ways. Here we have chosen to end up with household income as an important thing and, of course, also what kind of heating source you have. Because that has a lot to say, in relation to whether you are experiencing major price increases or whether you may experience some price increases that are a little easier to live with. So it's true that it's not perfect. There will certainly be cases, as we have seen in the media, of those who think that they were justified but do not receive heat help, or of people who, on the other hand, may not have the need, but who get help. But I don't think the Ekstra Bladet writes a lot of stories about the 419,000 households, of which this for the vast majority will fall in a dry place and be a real and important handshake.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173539	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173541	The rapporteur says that much has been done. I can at least say that it is not my experience that you were far around. My experience was that a solution was presented, and then you could accept it or not. But if the rapporteur, together with the Red Support Parties, has been far-reaching, I would like to hear: what other solutions have been discussed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173604	Well, you can, for example. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. kr. in electricity tax reductions to all, a so-called simple model. And it is simply said that it is not a model that will help those households that have the greatest need and have the most difficulty. For it would be a model in which it would be spread thinly across all households, including those in the higher income levels, which may not need a heating aid.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173637	Now you can get back in the regular way. Computer's working. The first is sir. Ole Birk Olesen of the Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173645	Denmark is an expensive country to live in. We probably have one of the world's highest VAT rates. We have the highest excise duties, excise duties, on various things and matters. And we also have relatively high income taxes in Denmark, which start early. Does the Social Democratic Party ever think that we have now come so far that, in order to pay all their taxes and taxes, the Danes must have a check of the government, which is written out by the fact that taxes are levied on people, that is to say, that this is a rather absurd situation? You take so much money from the Danes that they cannot pay their daily necessities, so you have to hand out a check to them afterwards.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173735	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173736	After all, it is not the level of taxation on gas, for example, that makes it difficult for people to pay their bills for gas. It is the price of gas that makes people find it difficult to pay their gas bills. That is the situation we are in now. And then we can discuss it. It is fair enough to have the ideological view that taxes should be reduced. We in the Social Democratic Party do not believe this as a starting point is the solution to all the world's challenges, because we also believe that it is important to have a strong welfare state where we have many good functions that are paid over the tax. So it is not our view that taxes should solve everything alone.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173822	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173823	Yes, the average gas consumption price has risen very sharply, and that is the problem here. But the reason why people cannot pay their own bills is that they have to pay very large sums of their income in income tax and taxes and VAT to the Danish state. If we let people who go to work every day and earn their own money keep a little more of their own money, then they could resist themselves instead of having to wait for a generous check from the government and hope for a generous check from the government, which comes in this case, but which may not come next time, there is a price increase for something. Is it not a rather bad situation for us to make people dependent on the public in the way that Social Democracy has done?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173910	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173910-2	Well, I'm in, sir. Ole Birk Olesen's general views when it comes to taxes. I would also just say that the tool we have chosen with the heat check is in line with what the National Bank is recommending, namely that, in this situation where we have high inflation, especially in the energy sector, we do not use general tax reductions as the primary tool, but rather that we focus on those who are in the greatest need of help.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173944	Sir. René Christensen, Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405173947	Thank you. The Danish People's Party doesn't agree with how this agreement is screwed up. I think you know that. However, I would just like to say to the rapporteur that the government is not opposed to all tax reductions. The government made an agreement with the Danish People's Party in January, where we among other things. reduced the electricity tax from 90 to 73 cents. It's also something you can feel out there when it's implemented. We would have liked to have brought them forward, but it has not been possible to get that agreement in place with the government. But I actually have a question, and it's just for understanding. When you read it through, you see that the terms the dwelling and the household are used a lot. I should just like to ask the rapporteur: if you are a national pensioner and live in your leisure home as a permanent accommodation, can you get a heating check if you have electric heating, for example?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174033	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174034	I would like to start by saying that I did not say that the Social Democrats are opposed to all tax reductions, and I am fully in favour of the agreement we have made, which, incidentally, will enter into force on 1 July, which is part of the general considerations of our greening and, of course, when we have a greener electricity supply, it also makes sense that we are considering taxes, but as such a tool in a crisis situation. That was more like what I was talking about. The rapporteur then asks a specific question about the accommodation. As I remember, if it is your primary home, and if you are one of the pensioners living there, it also counts, and I am sorry if it is not correct. But it's as I remember it. And the minister nods.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174125	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174132	The Danish People's Party was part of the negotiations until we could not agree at the end, at least in the first round. Perhaps it would have been easier at the end when the amount was doubled, but that is sometimes the case in the course of negotiations. At that time, however, it was difficult to get the holiday homes with them when they were used as one's home. But I would like to pay tribute to the government for the fact that after all it has been resolved and that a folk pensioner who lives in his leisure home can also benefit from the heating check. However, we think that far too few citizens will benefit from this, but that is the way it is. But we must also pay tribute to what, after all, has succeeded in the second round.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174206	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174207	I just want to say that I'm happy about that. That was a wonderful question for which I thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174216	Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174220	Thank you. When we started traveling this in November 2021, we could look into a scenario with high energy prices, and that scenario also continues next winter. What will the government do and will they pay out a new check in October or November? How will rising energy prices be dealt with next winter?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174243	There is no doubt that this is a challenging situation that we are facing, and it is actually also difficult to look right up to next winter and what exactly is going to happen with, among other things. the situation in Ukraine, but also how we manage to deal with the problems that we have with our supply chains, and I also know that intensive work is being done within the European Union to find solutions that make Europe best equipped for a new winter too. I certainly hope that the heat check will not be such a recurring thing that has come to stay in Danish politics. Because it should not be the case that some people sit at home and generally find it difficult to pay their heating bills and do not dare to turn up the radiator when it is cold outside. But I also think we have to say that this is an extraordinary and difficult situation that we are looking into and that it is therefore very difficult to say in concrete terms what we are going to do next winter in the situation we are facing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174351	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174351-2	But isn't it easy to create some expectations about this? And there are many who do not enjoy it, among other things. also pensioners who heat their house with electric panels. There are a couple living in Rønne who have written to me, and they have a high electricity tax now. It has increased by nearly DKK 9,000, and they have been retiring for seven years, but with their total pension they go just above that income limit, and they want a hand. There are a lot of people out there who want a hand, and do we also need a gas check for those who live outside the cities, who have a long transport and who also say: we have to do our job and we also need compensation? Compared to the track you're about to go down by making a check, I'd just like to ask, where is it you stop? And how exceptional a situation must it be before it triggers a new check?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174443	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174445	To the question, I would say that, as I see it, it is the rapporteur's own party which helps to raise false expectations in relation to the situation we are facing, for example, when the rapporteur's chairman in the back seat of his Volvo hascelerates over the high petrol prices and points out that it should be the government's fault that we are in the situation we are in. So I don't think the government is guilty of inflating some false hopes for people. I think it's Conservatives themselves who do it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174525	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten (The Red Greens).
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174528	Well Enhedslisten is pleased that we have ended up with a model that is not such an antisocial model, where you lower the electricity tax, but that we do something much more targeted. But we are also in a special situation, for example. Older People The matter is out of the question that now the retirement pension has been eroded due to rising energy prices, rising heat prices, rising food prices and pointing out that the national pension should actually be increased by 5 billion. kr. a year. I think we should take this seriously. I am well aware that it is energy policyians who are meeting here to discuss a proposal on heating, but this is social policy. I would really like to hear the rapporteur when the Social Democratic Party has helped to ensure that the green cheque is abolished for a number of people in Denmark, among others. the low-paid and those on cash benefits from New Year's. Would it not be an advantage to keep the green check so that it can be used as a tool to help some people with their high electricity bills?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174633	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174634	As I understand it: if you were to give a help that would be at the same level as the heat check, but via the green check, it would be significantly more expensive, because the green check also goes out to groups other than those that we have hit in with the heat check agreement as those that get this extra financial backup. Therefore, I do not immediately see that the green cheque would be the best alternative to the agreement that lies here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174711	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174712	No, it could be a supplement. It was the electricity bill that I asked about, and not the heating bill, because not all poor people are getting an increase in heating costs. It depends entirely on the municipality in which they live. I would like to ask another question, because now we have an agreement that says: 'The negotiators agree to meet again soon and negotiate on the concrete measures to get rid of the gas. I mean, when I read something like soon again, you'll meet in a minute. It was on 29 March that we made the agreement; and soon again we are for me already this week, because next week the Danish Parliament does not work. Does the rapporteur agree with me that soon again must be very soon?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174749	Yeah, I think that's what everyone's working towards, so we're gonna sit down very soon and look at this area. It is also crucial that we get the second leg, which is precisely that we should be free from the gas, and that we should help the Danes to get out of the gas as an individual form of heating.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174818	Thank you to Mrs Paulin there are no more brief remarks. That is why I would like to welcome Mrs Marie Bjerre from the Left - the Liberal Party of Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405174839	Thank you. We think it is good and right to help the Danes with the extremely high heat prices. This is a very special situation with unprecedented price increases. Very many Danes find it difficult to pay the price increases we see right now on gas and electricity. We must remember that a great many people have thus been bound to a certain source of energy, which has been politically determined; that is why we also have a political responsibility to help the Danes who have come into contact. At the same time, we are in a situation in which the Danish state is particularly benefiting from these high prices. We already know that the state is saving over 5 billion. kr. Just this year. That is why we in the Left have also said that we think it is reasonable to give more money back to the Danes. We have said that we are ready to spend a minimum of 2.7 billion. kr. But this agreement that the government has made with its red support parties is unfortunately just really bad. I'm gonna call it a piece of shit. It's administratively messed up. To counter the high price increases, an automatic gift cheque will be made for some Danes under a certain income limit. Paradoxically, the government has just been very concerned about making the heat check as administratively easy as possible, but the new administrative setup costs 50 million. kr., and it is so technical that the first Danes can not receive the heat check until September at the earliest. This model is causing considerable problems, and it is a shadow for the intentions, which the Elders Case has also written in their response to the hearing. Let me just mention ten of the absurdities and the many problems this heat check presents: First of all, the heat check takes no account of the size of the household. This means that a student gets the same check as the single mother with three children and that everything else needs a different heating requirement. Secondly, the heating check is based on household income in 2020, but it may have changed significantly since then. It may be a graduate student or an unemployed person who had a low income by 2020 but who has now got a good, well-paid job. He or she gets a check. Conversely, it may be the pensioner who retired last year but who in 2020 earned above the income limit. Now there's no help to get. And thirdly, the entire household's income is included in the income limit. This also applies to a lodger, and even if the property owner is below the income limit, there is no help. Fourthly, the check is automatically paid out to the oldest person in the property, but sometimes it is a tenant or a subletterranean. Perhaps the person concerned is not really the person who bears the heating costs because you pay a flat rent. Fifthly, no account is taken of those who live in a summer house as a whole-year residence where there are often no entries in the BBR register. Sixthly, the existence of a fixed price agreement has not been taken into account. This means that you can get the check even if you have not seen any increase on your bill. Finally, if you want to have a revenue limit, it seems a little off that you are not taking assets into account. This means that the national pensionist, who has a million income from equity income, is also eligible for a heating check. Eighthly, if you have been paid holiday money in 2020, as the Folketing and the government called for, and thus just got above the income limit, yes, then there is no heating aid to get. And ninthly, the heat check will not take into account whether there are errors in the BBR message, and I know that as a former lawyer there are quite often. If a home is misregistered with one of the included heat sources, you get a heat check. And opposite: If the housing is erroneously not registered with one of the included heat sources, but that the housing is actually heated with these sources, then you get nothing. Tenthly, the check does not even take into account how much your bill has increased; you get the same check, whether you live in an old, large property, which is hard to heat, or in a small brand new apartment with minimal heat consumption. In short, we think that this is a bad agreement, which in many cases is not helping the right people at all. We would have liked to have had another model that had more simply helped several Danes, such as the reduction of the electricity tax, payment to the plants and utilities, and we would also have liked to have seen an upward adjustment of the existing heating schemes in the municipalities. But this heat check is unthinkable, and it's bad craftsmanship. In addition, it is scandalous work purely democratic. I find it regrettable that Parliament only has three days to deal with the bill. The political agreement on the heat check was concluded on 11 February and the Ministry has had 6 weeks to prepare the legislation, and now you give the Folketing 3 days to deal with it. We have a deadline this evening in just a few hours to ask questions, and on Thursday we will have the second and third reading of the bill. It is not much time to be thorough, it is not much time to seek input from outside and to consult stakeholders. We think that is a problem. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175420	You're welcome. There are a few brief comments and the first is from Mrs Signe Munk, Socialist People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175426	It was nice to finally hear what the Left's so-called simple model is. One model is a reduction in the electricity tax of 2.7 billion. I would just like to ask Mrs Bjerre: how much will it give a family with an average electricity consumption, for example? In an apartment of 100 m2? But there was also another model, and it was that it should be paid through the utilities, and I would just like to hear Mrs Bjerre: is this a more complicated model than what has been assessed by officials, or a less complicated model than the heat check that has been presented now? Because there's been a note on this... it's been lifted into the negotiations.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175507	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175508	Indeed, we have been willing to look at many different models and have played constructively into the negotiations, but we have not been willing to look at any of the models. We have among other things. I would suggest that the electricity tax could be reduced, but that is not the only thing. We have also suggested, as Signe Munk says, that it should go through the works and make sure that the money is paid out to them, and then they could reduce the bill for the Danes who have had an increase in the heating bill over a certain amount. We think that would be more fair model and administrative also an easier model.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175537	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175538	Then I can tell Mrs Bjerre what the consequence of Mrs Bjerre's policy is. For it has been estimated that it is DKK 1,300 you would get in a household if you lowered the electricity tax for this year by what would equal to draw 2.7 billion. kr. From the Treasury. So it's less than the heat check. And the proposal to pay through the utilities has been assessed by the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Supply; the Left has been given the answer to that question, and the clear answer is: it will take longer, it is extremely difficult, and it will really reward those who save the least on heat. So, for the information provided by the rapporteur, it has been assessed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175618	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175619	We have among other things. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the only thing we want to do, and that is also what I am saying here: we would like to see more solutions. I listed three solutions: it was both the reduction of the electricity tax, it was also payment directly to the heating plants and utilities and, yes, it is true that we have been told in the Ministry that you were not in favour of the model, and then you have done this piece of work instead; we do not think this is sensible, and it is very administratively difficult and so we would have suggested that the already existing, well-known schemes that are in the municipalities could be adjusted up to help the Danes who have the very least.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175657	Then it's mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175700	Yes, and for the eleventh, there are 419,000 households who receive a tax-free heat check of DKK 6,000. I think that should also be included when the rapporteur has found ten hairs in the soup or thinks he has found 10 hairs in the soup. This reduction in the electricity tax would, of course, reward some people who had a high electricity consumption. Here we are, in fact, on the land of an agreement that very carefully goes in and helps some people who have been hit by high gas prices, and they are so accommodated that we are doing this one-time check. We have also been given the idea that those who have electric heating will also be included in the proposal. So we have actually ended up with something that is quite targeted at helping those households with the lowest income. Does the rapporteur not see that there is a social aim in what has become this country?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175758	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175759	Well, we can see that 419,000 households are being helped, and we think it is good to help. That is also what I started my rapporteur's speech with: there are quite unreasonable price increases that we see, and some Danes have been tied to a certain source of energy. That is why it is right to take political responsibility and help. But it is also necessary to have a problem with the model that is here. I have rarely seen so many challenges with a model, and I hope the rapporteur will acknowledge this. There will be a lot of Danes who would actually be in the target group, but because of all kinds of technicalities, they won't get a heat check. We think it's a shame that with this heat check you go in and help far too few people and, by the way, wrong.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175844	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175846	It is not easy to help with 2 billion. kr. without getting yelled at about it, and there will certainly be some examples, for example. about an elderly person who has been a sublet in an apartment and has moved at the right time, and yet gets DKK 6,000. in heating equipment, even if they have moved. Stories like this will come up in certain colorful magazines in Denmark. But that should not stop us from trying to do something that has a good social aim. And I actually think we're gonna hit a good shot here. And it is good that the rapporteur recognises that there are good elements in what we have here. And that is not a total amount that is quite far away from the 2.7 billion. kr. mentioned by the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175927	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175928	Yes, there will be examples of people who are not getting the help they really ought to have, or some who are getting help, even though it was not really intended. The problem is that there are too many examples. It's a bad deal that's been made. It's a mess, and you haven't wanted to listen to the input that's come. We think it is really a pity that you have ended up with this model, which is administratively very hassleful and not until September and even hits as badly as it does, with too many examples of people who do not get the help they should have.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405175958	Mrs. Anne Paulin, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180000	Yes, it is a bit comical to hear the rapporteur on the one hand say that the heat check does not take into account enough things and one and the other etc. etc., and then on the other hand says it should be much simpler and much faster. I simply do not believe that these considerations can be reconciled. It is also very clear when the rapporteur starts to explain the very simple model that the very simple model obviously contains various initiatives in which the money is spent several times. So perhaps the rapporteur can make us wiser on this simple model: how much is it going to go to the general electricity tax reductions that we have seen do not give very much to those households that really need it? How much will there be left to give to the companies, and how much will the municipalities be, as I would also like to point out to the rapporteur, that we have also provided aid with the supplementary agreement on the heat check? Can we get an overview of how the simple model is really connected?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180106	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180107	I have, of course, explained many times that we would like a more simple model and I have explained the solutions that we have played in with. Yes, we have been involved in several things because we have gone constructively into those negotiations, but we have not wanted to have the Left with us. But we have among other things. Pointed to a reduction in the electricity tax. We have pointed out here that the money is given directly to the heating plants, and we have pointed out that the municipal arrangements could be adjusted upwards. We have also said that we are open to other models. Let's discuss this with each other. But the problem is that we have been presented with this model and then we have been able to take it or not without being allowed to problematize it. There has been no interest in having the Left in those negotiations, and that is a pity. We also think that a really bad deal has been made. We would much rather have had a simpler model and there we would have been open to discussing various solutions. I have pointed to three that could be perfectly obvious to have the veil lifted, and I wish the government would want to count on those models, but it has not wanted to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180211	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180217	We've been counting on, among other things. the question of a general reduction in the electricity tax. And I think it is becoming very clear here that this so-called simple model is anything but simple, when the rapporteur himself cannot even try to create an overview for the rest of us who would like to understand the simple model of the Left, about what it really is that things should be together. How much money should be spent on one, how much money should be spent on the other? But let me ask a simple question: does the single mother, whom the rapporteur has problematizing in her speech, have the most to gain an electricity tax reduction of DKr 1 300? or to get a heat check of DKK 6,000.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180249	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180250	I actually think it's very simple. We'd like a more simple model. What you've done here is far from simple. This is an administratively troublesome model, which hits quite wrong, as I have already explained. We have then played in with what could have been a more simple model, and it would have been simpler to lower electricity taxes because it would hit all Danes. It would also have been simpler and more reasonable to pay directly to the works. It would also have been right to give a helping hand to the Danes who have the least, through the existing arrangements. I think that is quite simply explained. And in relation to my example: Well, if we take the single mother who feeds three children in a property that may be old and expensive to heat, then it is unreasonable that they should have the same check as the student who lives in a brand new dormitory apartment that has had a minimal warming increase.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180341	Thank you very much to Mrs Bjerre, there are no more brief comments. I would therefore like to welcome Mrs Signe Munk from the Socialist People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180401	Many Danes have been looking at the heating bill for a long time just to see that it has become more expensive and expensive. It happened even before Christmas that the increase in energy prices increased, and this has only worsened since Putin invaded Ukraine and brought war to Europe. In particular, natural gas has driven up prices, and I am actually basically concerned that we will have the natural gas retired and have green heat, both for the sake of the climate, for the sake of the purse and also for the sake of security policy. At the same time, however, it is also essential that we give economic support to those who are hit extraordinarily hard by the rising prices of energy. So now we are giving an economic boost where price increases hit the hardest and where revenue is lowest. It is an economic handout that will benefit 419,000 Danish homes, and let us be honest: it does not lift the whole burden of the rising heating bill. It's an economic aid to it. That means we're now sending $2 billion. Into heating aid. At the same time, we also lift the aid schemes that exist in the municipalities to help Danes on transfer income acutely with e.g. The heating bill or the electricity bill. That's where we put 200 million. kr. in the schemes to help cover the rising costs. It is a better choice than ill-thought-out reductions in energy taxes, which are covered in a thin layer and which will also go with the highest wages in this country, and indeed also those where the heating bill has not necessarily increased the most. At the same time, it is not the tool that the situation is providing right now. It is an instrument that can be used for other reasons, and we have in fact also in the agreement Denmark can reduce electricity tax on the first of July, a reduction and an agreement that most blue parties are not actually included in the agreement, despite the fact that there is much talk about lowering the electricity tax. There is much to be said about making new payout models. The short one is that it is not easy and that it is not simple, and there have already been many delays in the process, which is frustrating. When there are more of us who have set aside billions in heating aid, we have only one interest, and that is that they come out and help where they are intended. And that is why we are dealing urgently with the legislative proposal today. Once the heat aid is adopted, the effort will not stop here. In SF we still insist that there must be a radical green conversion of the Danes' heat while at the same time saving energy, and we must also recognise that with the rising prices in society, there is also a need to come more Danes with the lowest incomes to help.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180724	Thank you. There are three who have asked for brief comments. The first is Mrs Marie Bjerre. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180729	Thank you. The SF's rapporteur says that we would like to help the Danes in this situation with the exceptionally high heat prices. I would like to know whether the SF believes that it is sufficient that 2 billion have been allocated. kr. Now with the supplementary agreement, or whether the SF believes that more should be used.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180749	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180751	We are pleased that we can send 2 billion. kr. out in heat check for 419,000 households, a check for 6,000 DKK. After all, that is part of the agreement on which the parties that wanted to be included in the agreement could agree. If you ask if the heating aid and the heat check here in itself is enough in the situation we are experiencing now, when prices are generally rising in society, the answer is no, and we are also ready to look at other help for the low income groups in this society. But it is a broader discussion than just the heat discussion we have here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180825	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180827	But what I am asking is whether this is an adequate amount, all the time that the state is enjoying quite the benefits of rising energy prices. Just this year, the state saves 5 billion. kr., and therefore I would like to ask SF whether it seems that the amount allocated to this heating aid is sufficient, or whether SF has pressed and continues to press for additional funds to be used for heating aid.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180849	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180852	So, unfortunately, I do not think Mrs Bjerre has seen the latest assessment from the Ministry of Taxation of what total revenue is actually in relation to energy taxes, VAT, etc. And there's the assessment that the state won't make any more money. In relation to whether or not we can discuss increased aid, I would say that we can, but it is an agreement here, of the 2 billion. I think it is quite essential that we send an economic handout of DKr 6 000. out, and I'm glad.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180927	Mrs. Katarina Ammitzbøll.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405180929	Thank you. I'm afraid this children's check isn't good news for the children's families. If you're a nurse, you get an allowance, and with a pension you're up to 38,000 kroner, and if you're a primary school teacher, it's approx. Same thing. This means that those who work in the front line of our welfare sector, those who have worked hard under corona and maybe have two children, do not get a penny. Does the rapporteur think it is right that families with children working in the welfare sector should not benefit from this heat check, even if they have high energy bills?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181012	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181014	Well, the income limit is set for a household, and there may be different combinations of how the income is composed, and it is then set at DKK 650,000. before labour market contributions. It is true that account is not taken of whether it is a family for children or not, but of what the total income of the household is. There is just the fundamental challenge of adding more and more elements to which I can hear that parties proposing simple models are in favour, i.e. both what the quality of the dwelling is and how many children live there, but then you get an even more complicated model. And that is why we are actually satisfied that we have chosen, given that it is becoming more complicated, that it is fair enough to say that there is a household income limit, and with the income base used to calculate it here, it is a quite traditional way of doing it, and pensions are not included.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181107	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181109	You can say a lot about this model, but it's just surprising that it would take four months to do something with such a wide brush, when in the initial discussions we had many more factors when it was discussed how to actually do it. But one has chosen a very, very simple solution with a very, very low level. But what I want to ask the rapporteur is: if you're going to calculate this check, what kind of heating bill is you gonna take? Do you take the last three months? Now it has to be paid in May, so it will be August and thus over the summer months. Or what period do you take? Because there is a difference in that. If you take the last 3 months until you can get the heat check, then your energy consumption is probably down because it's getting warmer. Something else is also in relation to income. Last year a lot of people were paid their holiday money. What is the rapporteur's position on this? Does anyone have an artificially higher income than they normally have?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181213	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181216	It is clear in the bill that the bill relates to the firing season 2021-22. So it's pretty clear in the bill. The next thing is that in relation to which year of income you start, I had hoped that we could start from 2021. However, the assessment is that there are not enough annual accounts to be used from that year, and therefore 2020 is the best possible year. In relation to the problem of holiday money, we have also raised the limit here in relation to household income, which is why there are more in the first hot-check agreement that can be included. But it's a shame it can't be 2021. However, the best possible basis is 2020, and that is also clarified in the legislative proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181300	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181303	After all, when world gas prices are rising, it serves as an incentive for consumers of gas to find some other sources of heat than gas. After all, it is possible to enjoy the fact that the incentive to switch to greener sources of heat was greater than the burning of fossil gas. So the SF, together with the government and other red parties, chooses to say: No, we certainly cannot have that, so people must have a subsidy to continue burning fossil energy. Why? It is something strange that when the market helps to encourage a green transition in the homes, the SF chooses to say that then we have to make some state subsidies that prevent people from changing energy forms.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181353	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181355	Fortunately, I am a member of a two-legged party. One is to take care of those in society who have the least money in their pockets, and the other is to create a fundamental green and sustainable transformation of our society. These two considerations, I think, maybe this heat check can bear. I'll give you $6,000. in an economic aid to families with the lowest incomes in this country for emergency aid to the heating bill, but it does not cover the full increase in the heating bill. At the same time, the rapporteur will also be able to see from the draft law that there is no assessment that this will have a climate adverse effect, since it will not be possible to recognise it in the future as part of the payment for one's heating bill, but that it is a one-off grant. What we can see in general terms is that there are many Danes who react to the gas price rising if they can and switch to cheaper heat forms, for example. connects to district heating or heat pumps.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181501	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181503	Such an increase in market prices must not lead to people being encouraged to choose another form of energy source. They must be compensated so that they can continue to burn gas through state subsidies, whereas SF would like to impose taxes on cigarettes so that the lowest income groups mark on the wallet that if they do not do what the SF would like, then they must pay for it. Inequality is not a problem when charges are raised by SF, but inequality is a problem when market prices make it more expensive to fire gas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181538	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181540	One might think that comparison rhetorically makes sense. But I don't mean that when you just look at the situation we're in right now. We have had some extraordinary, immediate price increases on natural gas in particular, which means that some people are being put in a hard economic situation. We are now giving them financial support. That is not to say that they must be kept in natural gas; they must of course be helped to get away from natural gas. Because it is quite true that the basic green conversion and the basic, long-term help to get both greener heat supply, but also cheaper heat supply is to get rid of natural gas and get a much more electricity-based heat supply.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181623	Thank you to Mrs Signe Munk. There are no more brief comments. Welcome to sir. Rasmus Helveg Petersen from the Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181631	This is a bill which, of course, provides a lump sum for the lowest household incomes with the most expensive heat sources. That is, it must be admitted immediately, an imprecise law. It is not millimeter-, it is not even centimeter-righteous, but it does one thing right for a law of its kind: if you are to give a fossil subsidy, it must be targeted, and it should not be general. This is an unfortunate situation we are in, of course triggered by the terrible situation in Russia and Ukraine. There are people who have seen even very large price increases on their heat and gas. We are giving a small compensation, but with good reason not a full compensation and with good reason not a compensation for everyone. We are doing this in order that prices will continue to break through and continue to encourage people to save gas, which is good both for the climate and for their own pockets and in the opposite direction for exports from Russia of gas. However, I cannot be in such an agreement here if it is not linked to a political agreement, and this is it. It's a political agreement that adds to the agreement on this heat check, which decides that we should completely phase out oil and gas in our space heating in Denmark. This is useful both for the climate and for the heating bill and for the gas imports from Russia, and it is the condition that we have agreed to this heat check. I myself, as climate minister, have stood on international platforms and thundered against fossil subsidies, but here it goes hand in hand with a very, very ambitious phasing out of fossil fuels in our heat. We want a heating plan before the summer holiday, so we give people a safety for the future heat source and we put superturbo on the roll-out of district heating and heat pumps. This is what can be done both in the long term and in the second and third of our problems. The Radical Left supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181830	You're welcome. The first brief remark is from Mr. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181834	Sir. Rasmus Helveg Petersen hangs his green hat on the fact that it is a lump sum, because if it were a recurring amount, it would even more prevent people from encouraging them to switch to a greener energy source than gas. Does that mean that Mr. Rasmus Helveg Petersen can guarantee that if winter 2022-23 meets the same gas prices as now, will the Radical Left not take part in distributing another heat check?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181914	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181916	Thank you. It's not included in this, this is not a recurring payout, it's a one-time thing we're standing here and agreements, on the basis of a one-time situation, a unique situation we haven't seen anything like it. So I can assure you, sir. Ole Birk Olesen says that what we put in full turbo is not to institutionalize a heat check, but to abolish the use of gas and oil in our space heating.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181938	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405181941	Yes, there is a legal reality and there is a political reality. I am asking about the political reality, and Mr. Rasmus Helveg Petersen responds with the legal reality. The legal reality is that the bill here is a lump sum. The political reality that I am asking is: if gas prices repeat themselves at a high level in the winter of 2022-23, will the Radical Left regard this as a precedent set for the political reality, which repeats to hand out a heat check, or will the Radical Left say no to that time?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182013	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182017	Thank you. This is a one-off sum, and I say this with confidence, because it is very important that this does not appear to be a permanent arrangement which gives precisely the opposite incentive to change sources of heat than what we want. In this agreement, then, the Radical Left has conditional on political agreements which made us say yes to the heat check. I will not rule out the possibility that we could make a similar trade some other time, but the signal I want to send now is that we have thereby fulfilled our part of an agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182043	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182046	Thank you. The rapporteur mentioned a desire for a heating plan before the summer recess. We share that wish in the Enhedslisten. We had a delegation in the KEF committee last week from Danish District Heating, which among other things. on its list had to make such a national screening of the areas that have gas heating in order to determine the extent to which district heating areas can be expanded. It was something they talked about as something that could happen in 2-3 months. Is this element something that is included in the wishes of the Radicals for a heating plan before the summer break? And are there any other elements that the rapporteur can already see must be put into such a heating plan which can provide certainty as to what kind of conversion we need to prioritise?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182135	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182138	Yeah, that's exactly one of those elements. An excellent proposal for a heating plan has already been made at Aalborg University. The most important thing right now and here is to give people who sit at home and are chained to a fossil, expensive heat source that they really want to get rid of, a guarantee of what they should have instead. There it is my opinion that I sit on the economy and the climate that those who can get district heating must have district heating. We must give them a guarantee of that. So we mainly tell people who live in a natural gas area that here we will come with district heating within a few years. Everyone else should know: You live in an area where there is probably no district heating within a foreseeable period of time. And then we can start rolling out heat pumps at high speed to those who are sitting with gas guys, but who cannot expect to have district heating. So this certainty in the form of a heating plan is number one before we can really start firing the cannons with heat pumps and district heating, as it were. Time went by. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182237	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182239	Well, it's nice to hear that the guns have to be fired by the right places. Now our last agreement says that the parties to the agreement will at the same time agree to meet again soon and negotiate on the concrete measures to get rid of the gas. Then we have an agreement that we will meet as early as Friday to give priority to 250 million. kr., which was in the last appointment. I would really like to hear something from the rapporteur. When you have to meet again soon and there is a prospect of a case next week, is it not this week that soon we will have to be interpreted again in the direction that today we can also sort of come to the conclusion that we are meeting this week in order to get on with the green elements of our agreements soon again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182320	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182322	I'd always like to meet on this subject, sooner rather than later. But if it should be immediately after Easter, I will also be able to live with it, as long as the result is good.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182330	Thank you, sir. Rasmus Helveg Petersen. There are no more brief comments. That's why we're gonna go over to mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen from Enhedslisten (The Red Greens).
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182345	This is, of course, an interesting approach, if accepting that you meet a little later, then results in better results. Then I understand that we can accept a certain amount of patience in some debates that we can be impatient about. I could see that the minister went down. However, I would like to meet you this week on these important issues. Enhedslisten can support this bill for a higher heat check of DKK 6,000. tax-free for households that have gas heating or electric heating. This is a major aid to over 400,000 households. But that's not enough in this particular situation. Elders The case points out that the retirement pension should be increased by 5 billion. kr. a year to compensate for the rising prices, and these are rising prices of heat, electricity and food, etc. In fact, I think that this is a reasonable demand, and I also think that the benefit negotiations that are under way should be marked by the fact that the poorest part of the population has a erosion of their income. In view of the fact that other parties in the Social Democratic Party, the SF, Radicals, DF and the Christian Democrats will abolish the green cheque for the lowest paid and for cash benefits recipients from New Year, I really think that a good tool should be removed, which should be retained, so that, for example, we can get rid of it. could give an increase in the green cheque on the basis of rising electricity prices, i.e. not heating prices, but electricity prices, which affect everyone with low revenues. This debate here has given 2 billion. kr. for heating, but it has also paid 200 million. kr., which the municipalities can use to accommodate the citizens with energy aid, and so it is both electricity and heat that you will be able to make applications. And then we secured the 250 million. kr. to green district heating, which we will meet and negotiate on Friday. That means a total agreement of 2.45 billion. kr. But the lasting aid is to help phase out the fossil gas. We have yet to give priority to this task. It is a conversion that can both contribute to climate solutions, can ensure independence from imported gas and can ensure that Denmark does not finance Putin's attack war. Some parties have supported the construction of Nord Stream 1 which allowed Putin to finance its armaments over the years. It has therefore been paid for by European countries. There have also been many parties in the Danish Parliament which have supported the establishment of Nord Stream 2. Fortunately, it has not been applied. But this is, of course, a plan which has ensured that Putin could sell more gas to Europe. At the moment, we in Europe have an excessive dependence on Russian gas and we are currently helping to finance Putin's war if that is how we are going to pay the gas bill when the sanctions end and money can be transferred to Russia. There's real reason to phase out that gas. Renewable energy is the solution both in Europe and in Denmark, and in Denmark we are going to have district heating based on geothermal, heat pumps and solar heat supplemented by Danish biomass. We should quickly uncover where it makes sense to deploy more district heating. The Enhedslisten supports a national screening of gas heating areas, so we get a quick clarification, which according to Danish district heating can take place in 2-3 months. After that, the municipalities can look at the result, because the municipalities are responsible for the overall planning of heat, and I really think that should remain in the municipalities. But I think this national screening should be done to provide them with a tool for making proper conclusions, and it must be done as soon as possible. The screening will, of course, clarify which households should continue to have an individual heat solution. It will, of course, clarify that the gas guy that many households have should be past and heat pumps are possibly supplemented by solar heat or other heat sources in the future. There must also be a special focus on ensuring the conversion of the district heating companies that use gas now. These are district heating companies listed in the draft law. 80 companies. That's actually quite a lot. I would really like to clarify how we are helping those companies to phase out the gas. I have asked committee questions about this, and I think, like other rapporteurs, that this timetable for the legislative proposal is just as strict as it is. So, we have an hour after this treatment to put our last question, and then there are some who have to go to night work and answer the questions very quickly, and then we have the second and third readings on Thursday. It is therefore an urgent procedure which is a little too urgent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182854	Thank you. Then it's mr. Ole Birk Olesen with a brief comment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182856	If the gas price is high in winter 2022 and 2023, does Enhedslisten think that a heat check should be handed out again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405182910	No, we don't think so. We attach great importance to the fact that we can help as many people as possible to get rid of the gas and we are well aware that we are not going to end up with everyone. But instead of sending out heat checks again, I actually think I'm better off giving the municipalities a bigger bag of money that those who have been hit by high energy prices can apply for. I think that is actually a better solution, so it is not our intention to repeat this next winter. One might say that with what we are doing now, we are helping some people who have been confronted with high bills. We should not have a system in which we support continuing on fossil fuels by creating an expectation that we will also come and help next winter. No, that is not our approach to it at all. But we also have a recognition that phasing out gas in so many households is actually something that takes time. Those who set up heat pumps believe that they can install 70,000 heat pumps per year. It's actually too low a pace.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183018	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183020	But this heat check wasn't Enhedslisten's favorite. The Enhedslisten would have preferred to have done something else already now, for example. That's what Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen mentioned here. Yet it ended up with Enhedslisten doing what the government wanted, namely voting in favour of a heat check for fossil gas burning. We heard before the radical rapporteur say that he was perhaps also open to a trade next winter. Is Enhedslisten also open for a trade next winter if the government would like to give a heat check again? And if the answer is yes, will Enhedslisten agree that Enhedslisten has entered a path that is about providing subsidies for burning fossil fuels?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183058	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183100	I heard what the Radicals said quite differently. What we are going into now is making a green deal as soon as possible. After all, we must meet soon, as the agreement says, and then we would very much like to be involved in prioritising and changing the framework conditions and financing it with subsidies or whatever. We are, in fact, open to the means, but we must, of course, ensure that we phase out as much fossil gas as possible as possible. That is our approach to it and not to hand out as many checks as possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183130	Mrs. Marie Bjerre.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183133	I note that the rapporteur is concerned that this heat check comes for household income, that there is a social purpose with the heat check, but why is one more concerned with it rather than creating a simple model that helps the Danes who have actually had the biggest bills, the Danes who are experiencing the biggest heat increases?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183158	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183201	Well, I haven't seen that simple model well described, because if you're going to make it very fair, you're going to have to look at what kind of gas deal each household has with that gas dealer, whether you have a fixed price deal or not. And you have to look into what these are deals that the heating plants, about 80 of which have gas firing, have. We are well aware that this check is not a millimeter-right, we are well aware of that, and we really think that the first agreement we made, where there was a lower income limit, was better than agreement number two. But that's what it was. I also see some arguments to the effect that, when we have called on the Danes to have their holiday money paid, it is fair enough that we raise the total limit, so that fewer people are affected by it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183257	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183259	I am glad that the rapporteur can see that there are some problems with this heat check, because there is indeed. But isn't it just a cover for social redistribution rather than making a real heat check and heating help? Does the rapporteur not recognise that there is a difference between income limits and available amounts, and with such a heat check here, where you go solely for the income limit, it may be that a family of children in which both mother and father work is most likely not to get any heat help at all, despite the fact that it can be really difficult to make the economy relate to these extraordinarily high price increases we have seen on heat?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183334	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183335	We are aware that we are not all helping everyone with this heat check, but after all we are helping 419,000 households with a tax-free check of DKK 6,000, which can help pay the high bills they are exposed to. We are well aware that it is not a millimeter-righteous thing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183356	Thank you, sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen. There are no more brief comments. Welcome to Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll of the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183405	Energy is the backbone of the green transition, and energy is now also the greatest geopolitical challenge facing Europe. But the importance of green energy is certainly also something that almost all Danes notice on the wallet because of the high energy prices, especially on gas. But it is generally expensive, including electricity. Everyone can feel it. Approx. 52% of the Danes are concerned that rising energy prices can have a noticeable impact on their private economy. 60% A recent study shows that children's families are concerned. We believe that the government's check helps too few and too late. We raised it and discussed it at the turn of the year. The government also sprung out a little during the municipal elections. It was November 17th, so it was a long time ago. After all, we would have paid out the entire unbudgeted amount for the renewable energy aid scheme. 2.7 billion kr., so we were up in that rent a long time ago. The government's heat check is bad news for families with children; they still have towering bills and no compensation. Are the little kids on the floor supposed to freeze? For example, a school teacher and a teacher will probably still not be able to receive the check if they have been at work for some years. Those in our welfare sector who have worked hard, those who are constantly being talked about, who need to be helped with minimum standards in relation to better welfare, those who take care of our sick, those who have really worked hard, also during the Corona period, will not benefit from this. The check is also bad news for those who work, those who do their jobs and try to support themselves. Although the government has called their heat check here an emergency economic handout, it comes to August at the earliest. It's late. But there are also several problems with the check in the way, the basis for the payment is calculated and paid out. You can read from the hearing answers that have come to light that the problem is that citizens, for example. must use their income from a year which has been exceptional because of the frozen holiday money for which there was otherwise broad support. Another problem is that tenants of homes where the heat is including the fixed monthly rental will benefit from the extra heating supplement, but not landlords who face the challenge of heating prices. There are several things in those hearing answers. As the situation is now, we would have liked to have helped more and more. Now that you have spent so much time, 5 months, to come up with such a simple solution, there could have been other measures, for example. an opportunity to phase out gas faster. We need to replace our gas guy. There's still 400,000. Now is the time to get them replaced. There could be subsidies for conversion from gas pine to heat pumps, support for district heating plants that want to switch their production from gas to large heat pumps, expand their district heating areas, make a proper screening, so that you know where there is district heating and where it does not come and what we can do to make a targeted effort, increased electrification in the industry. You could think a little more, be a little more innovative. Instead, the usual handle is seized by trying to distribute a little money to them with the lowest income. That's pretty disappointing. Of course, there is also an element about gas guys. That's what the agreement says. We also think that the opportunity could have been used here to look at a change in some of the subsidy schemes that are so troublesome and bureaucratic, for example. for heat pumps. Perhaps you could turn it into a deduction • smarter for both citizens and professions. So, yes, it's sad that it has to be so long before you get the acute check. But then it has to be rushed through like this. I think it's too bad. It's too bad you don't get to sit at the table, it's too bad it all has to be pushed through like this. There isn't even time to ask questions. So I would now like to take this opportunity to ask my questions in the last few seconds that remain of my speaking time. Is it reasonable that a whole lot of families with two parents in work, especially in the welfare sector, should not be given a hand? Can the government guarantee that those they have promised a check will actually receive it in August or September? So far, it's just been postponed and postponed. Is it reasonable that children's families with parents in work do not get a heat check while a couple, where only one works, get the check? Is it fair to get 0 kroner if both parents earn more than 30,000 kroner? a month, but that you get 6,000 kroner if parents earn 29,416 kroner. a month? Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183902	You're welcome. There are a few brief comments. The first one is from Mrs. Signe Munk. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183907	That's interesting. There is a simple model in the Left that is so complicated that the rapporteur cannot explain it, and in Conservatives you just have a new model like that for the week we are in. Last week it was the employment allowance that had to be raised to help pensioners, and now it is a scheme that will help families with children. Then the rapporteur could not just explain to you here: who gets money to help with the model of the Conservatives? When do they get it and how much do they get? It's just so we just know what model it is this week.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183939	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405183941	As we say, there are a lot of handles. Actually, they're also in my papers here. I would very much like to send them to Mrs Signe Munk. I also mentioned some of that last week, but you cannot repeat yourself because there was not time for it all. There are several handles. One was precisely a deduction. We wanted to increase the employment allowance. That's right. The second was that we also wanted to ensure that the old people's pension is not set off against them. Here I mentioned, among other things. the couple from Rønne who might well go out and do a little more to pay their heating bills. They're fresh and cheerful and they're in the early '70s. I'm getting incredibly many inquiries. Those people could also have been helped. Then we also believe that we should have paid out the money that the state has saved. These could have been paid quickly to all those who have the high heating bills, so that those who are in work also receive a helping hand. Fourthly, how can we do this so that these heating bills are reduced? I just gave some examples of this. So there's actually a lot more action than this very simple and very late-acting model.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184048	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184050	Now, I think we are just moving into purely general fiscal policy, so it would be fine for the rest of us if the rapporteur were to tell us just how many billions the rapporteur has distributed and how they are to be financed. Where in welfare is to be cut? Which nurses should be fired in order for the rapporteur to be able to finance all the promises that have just been made, in other words both in relation to the RES schemes, the increase in the employment allowance and so on.? So how many billions have been spent and how are they to be financed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184113	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184115	First of all, we said 2.7 billion. kr. Before. Secondly, in Conservatives we made a financial bill that says that we can actually save 7 billion. kr. It's in our financial bill game that we did this autumn. There is also the matter of offsetting the old-age pension and raising the employment allowance. It's all there and it's funded.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184135	Mrs. Anne Paulin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184138	Thank you so much. Like the previous one, I also think that it is very difficult to be wise about exactly what model Conservatives are proposing in this context. So could the rapporteur not clarify that? I think 2.7 billion is being said. kr. Up here from the platform, and I have also heard the rapporteur throw the figure of 4.9 billion. kr. In the past, the rapporteur can clarify whether it is 2.7 billion. kr. you want to spend, or whether it's 4.9 billion. kr.? And how do you see this structured, that is, how many x billions or millions are going to be allocated to what different proposals? And with regard to the apparently conservative desire for significant reductions in petrol and diesel taxes, it must also be financed from these 2.7 or 4.9 billion. kr.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184236	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184237	I don't think I'm gonna throw anything out. I think that's a weird way of saying things. We said, and we did so with several parties when we started this at the beginning of the year, that we could see that there were 2.7 billion. kr. that had not been used, and it was also confirmed. It was for 2021 and it was also said that there was also a similar amount in 2022. So it was discussed how much one could take, because it is not because one has to take it all; it is not a room for manoeuvre. But we looked at what might be reasonable. And I would just like to say that there was, of course, a large amount of money that could have been given priority over it. The amount we originally mentioned was 2.7 billion. kr., but now we are in a situation where inflation rises to 4.6 per cent, and it is estimated here that the extra bills for children's families, just because of inflation, are about DKr 13,000. That is why we say that we had many different proposals that we could have brought to the negotiating table. It is not the case that we are saying that only one model we had many proposals we would have liked to have sat and discussed at the table, but there has been no possibility of that. We haven't been invited here in the second round, and we think that's too bad. It has not even been opened up to listen to us, and now we have so little time to ask questions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184347	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184350	I am sorry if the rapporteur thought that it was a wrong choice of words when I said that she had thrown something out, and it may also be that it was, but it was an expression that I think it is very arbitrary what comes from the Conservative People's Party. One week it is an amount and a number of initiatives, and next week it is another amount and other initiatives. The rapporteur is shaking his head so that the rapporteur may be able to give a quick confirmation that it is right to see that it is 2.7 billion. kr., which the Conservative People's Party wants to spend on heating aid.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184421	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184423	Yes, that was the initial amount when we started at the beginning of the year, and when we looked at what situation we were in with the high gas prices. Now we can see that it is now an expensive one in many areas, including for those who use electricity, and that is also why we are saying that more action is needed, because this is not an emergency. When we all talked about this in January, there was no war in Ukraine, and there we could not see how high energy prices would remain. I think we all thought a little bit: this is going to pass, it's temporary, we just have to make it through the winter. But we look into another scenario now, and that is why we are asking for thought to be given to how we can help many more Danes. The rapporteur said before that you could not know whether it will be the same next winter, but you know that. All experts say that this is something that continues, that we are going to have high energy prices. That is why we are saying that we need to look at more options.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184522	You can talk yourself warm. Thank you to Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll. There are no more brief comments. Welcome to sir. René Christensen from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405184538	Thank you for that, President. Actually, this case is not as easy as a lot of people are going to make it. Whether it's 2 billion. kr. Or it's 2.7 billion. kr., maybe that's not the question here. The question is probably that there are some citizens out there who unfortunately have some energy sources which, unfortunately, have increased significantly in price. There are probably also some citizens who have some houses and properties in which they live and which are not isolated well enough and where you simply have too much heat consumption. What can you do in the short run? There you can give a lump sum. But it's kind of an artificial breath, and here I'm going to make a little story. I was in Faxe, where I was down to see Nikolai. Nikolaj is on sickness benefit. He lives in a small townhouse which is rather poorly isolated; it actually needs to be modernised in, I think, it was in 2024. He had electric heating. I saw his bills, and for a single month, which had been a cold month, he had had the highest bill, and that was in November when he had received an electric bill of DKK 4,300. Then he also had a rent on top, then he had his union quota, and so he had a phone, and then he would also like to watch a little TV. He sat there with his sickness benefits, looked at his bills and said, "What kind of money do I have to pay?" He simply could not afford to pay all of them. And that is the situation that some people are in. I definitely think he's one of those people who gets this heat check, and that's gonna help him out a little bit. It's not the case that the heat check is supposed to cover people's electricity consumption, it's supposed to cover the extra cost; we also know that it's not like this $6,000 that it's only up to 2 months. He would probably have had an ordinary electricity bill of about 2,000 kroner, and now it had more than doubled. So it's a few months he gets help with. But what's interesting here, Enhedslisten, was also a little bit about it, is: what is going to happen in the future for these citizens? Because there is no doubt that this discussion will be avoided for five or six months, but then it will come back again. So we're going to have to discuss again whether or not we need 2 billion. kr. or 2.7 billion. kr.? We simply have to give some of these citizens some incentive for them to have another source of heat, to have their houses better isolated, so that they get some lower costs. I also believe that we should have looked more closely at what the government has done, and that is what we are doing with the agreement, and that is where 200 million are being set aside. kr. to the municipalities so that they can pay a lump sum. It was the case that a large proportion of the people who are most affected by this are, of course, all hit equally hard in crowns, but there are some who have a higher amount of money available than other people who have the minimum amount of money available, because many of them are on transfer income. Perhaps the municipalities could have been given a greater tool for this because they know their citizens so that they could give some more lump sums to these citizens to help pay the extra cost of their electricity bills. That tool is a tool you know out there, and I think it is according to section 34 of the social legislation that you can give these one-off grants, so it is the municipalities that have to decide whether it is with a refund obligation or whether it is a one-off sum you have received. There we clearly believe, in relation to this situation, that there should be a one-off sum that had been received. It could have filled more of the deal, so at least those who have the least hit would have been hit. But now that you choose to make it as a check, we find it odd that you put this ceiling on household income of DKK 650,000. If you go in and look at such an ordinary LO family, which doesn't have to be very rich or anything, and which has general expenses, you see that there is actually an average wage of DKK 766,500, which is the figure you have. So if they're an ordinary 3F family who goes to work and cares for their things and pays their taxes, they don't get any help with an expensive gasping, electricity bill or for that matter to their wooden pills, even though they've increased significantly. We are also somewhat surprised at the fact that there are some heat sources that are not included in the agreement. Among other things: As far as wood pellets are concerned, some citizens have chosen to say: well, we want to be green, but we do not have access to district heating, so we have chosen to take in some biofuels. But it has also increased significantly. They've also been taken out of the equation here. What I do welcome, however, is that you should always remember this when you have a bill that you do not think is so good is that there is something that has succeeded in the government. When we were in the negotiations during the first round, it was not quite certain whether it would be possible for early retirement pensioners who have their leisure residence as a permanent dwelling to become part of the agreement, but they have been included, and this has been confirmed today by the Socialist rapporteur, and I also saw the Minister nodding on it. We welcome that. They are, of course, some of those who sit in some homes, which, unfortunately, for many cases are not so well isolated and are therefore also expensive to heat. So all in all, I hope that the Minister will call for negotiations, and we would very much like to be there. How do we ensure that in the short time available we get as soon as possible to district heating where it makes sense or to other sources of heat that could be individual sources of heat such as heating? heat pumps, and it could also be geothermal? And I hope that we will have a heating plan both at municipal and national level? Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185050	Thank you. There are no brief comments. So we say thank you, sir. René Christensen, and we move on to Mr. Peter Seier Christensen from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185101	The agreement we are discussing now is not the way we wanted it to be. We proposed in the negotiations that instead of granting a subsidy, taxes should be reduced. There was no majority in favour of this, and since aid would then only help selected groups based on a revenue limit, we did not participate in the agreement. We also believe that the amount set aside is too small. 2 billion kr. heat help should be provided, but only to households where the income is less than DKK 650,000, and the help now comes in the form of a check. Now a select group of citizens gets a check to be used to pay taxes. It is a backward way of doing things, and it also turns out to take a long time. The government expects the money to be paid out by September. While all Danish families experience that purchasing power is falling, that prices are rising and that the budget is tightening up, last year the state collected a surplus of approx. 59 billion kr. and is counting this year on a profit of approx. 17 billion. kr. It is a great deal of money that the Danes have paid in taxes from their own pockets, and which politicians now put in the box to spend on what they themselves find best in the coming years. New citizens believe that part of that money should be brought back to the Danes right now, so we are actually proposing that the bottom tax should be reduced by 1%, that electricity tax should be reduced and that the tax on petrol should be reduced. Overall, it will cost approx. 17-19 billion. kr., and it can well be financed by the huge profits of the Treasury. Our proposal also has the advantage that the relief can be introduced here and now; the bottom tax can even be reduced retroactively, so the relief will apply from January. So we don't like the deal that lies here. However, the bill we are debating will mean that some citizens will be helped, and it is, after all, better for some to receive help than for no one to get help, so New Citizens will therefore support the bill. This agreement is aimed at the citizens, or rather some of them, and I would therefore like to call for an aid to be looked at for those who are very badly affected. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185307	You're welcome, sir. Peter Seier Christensen. There are no brief comments. So I would like to welcome Mr. Ole Birk Olesen of the Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185318	It is now so expensive to live in Denmark with all the taxes and taxes and a world-recorded VAT that we pay here that we will have to have a check of the government, which is given out with the money we have paid in taxes and taxes, so that we can make it through the winter. It is quite an incredible situation to be faced with the fact that people have been impoverished so that the population cannot resist if it is that world gas prices are rising, so that people's own money has to hand them out a check for which they can buy heat. This is Absurdistan. What if we had a majority in the Folketing who instead cared that we should have a strong and well-functioning and self-reliant people in this country and that we should pursue a policy that could ensure that people themselves could resist when they were hit by fluctuations in world prices. We don't. We have a policy that keeps people at a rather low level of private consumption because they have to pay so many taxes and taxes, so if there is some turbulence on the world market, they have no money left to resist, and then they have to stand with the hat in their hand and ask for a heat check of DKK 6,000. from the public authorities, which they have also paid with their own VAT and their taxes and income tax. We will never be involved in this kind of thing, nor will we be involved in the fact that, when there is finally a market volatility in the price of fossil fuels that can motivate people to switch to a more green energy source, we say that no, it certainly should not happen, but we must hand out a check so that they can keep burning gas instead of switching to a cheaper and more green energy source. This is also the completely reversed world, and what we are seeing here today, when people from the Enhedslisten and from the Radical Left answer from me that this is really just a one-time check, is the legal reality that we can find in the bill that we are discussing today. But the political reality is that a precedent is now being set, so that if we go into a time of just as high gas prices as today next winter, then it will probably be the same political majority who says that well yes, but now it is again a sin, so people have to have a check again, and they know it well out there. You know that this majority finds it a pity when the heat prices of fossil fuels are rising, and they know that they do not need to switch to a more green energy source, for Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen from Enhedslisten, Climate Minister, Mrs Signe Munk from SF and Mr. Rasmus Helveg Petersen from the Radical Left will come ascending next winter with a heat check again if people have not switched to a more green and a cheaper energy source than gas. Of course these parties and these politicians do. The lack of backbone which means that today they cannot resist when prices rise will also be there in a year's time, when winter is once again at the door and gas prices are the same, in other words exactly the same lack of backbone. Yeah, I don't have to keep doing that, but it'll be there again next year too. So people out there who think that no, we don't have to change and that they will probably come back with a check are probably absolutely right, and that's also why this will not lead to a conversion of energy in the homes, and you will continue to burn off gas in the expectation that next time there will be a check. Therefore, it is also some phony calculations that come from the Ministry when the Ministry says that there is no such effect on the green transition in Denmark that people recognise this as an expectation and therefore they do not change. If they knew that this winter became expensive and that next winter would be expensive again, if they didn't switch, then more people would switch over than when you hand out a check, and when people have an expectation that it will happen again next year. So it is simply not true when the Ministry makes calculations showing that this is affecting the green transition. That's not true. What the Ministry is counting on isn't true. So we're voting against this. We don't hand out checks to people for their own money. Instead, we want to reduce taxes and taxes so that they themselves can resist winter.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185809	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185812	It is amazing to hear the Oracle of the Liberal Alliance come up with what other parties will do. I believe that the rapporteur completely underestimates the population. This attack war launched by Putin means that there are many people who do not want to depend on fossil gas from Russia more or less indirectly. I also believe that the climate crisis is contributing to the fact that more and more people can see that we need to get rid of this gas fire. I am sure that in a number of small heating plants where gas turbines have otherwise been trimmed out there, and perhaps that was a good solution, we have now come to the realization that they need to make a transition. And we're gonna help those works. Then we need to clearly define what kind of households it is with individual heating, which will continue to have individual heating and will not have district heating at any time. That is the clarification that we will give priority to on the part of the Enhedslisten, and not what the Oracle of the Liberal Alliance outlined.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185919	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405185922	Well, I certainly think that there are people who are sensible and I even think that there are many who are reasonable and say that now they have to change, even if they get a check. But there will be other people who say: 'Oh, we don't have to change now, because we will have a check, and there will probably be a check next year, because why shouldn't there be?' When a check can be made for a year, then there may be a check next year in which we are faced with the fact that there will soon be parliamentary elections. Who would think, and who would think, that Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen has more ass in his pants when the parliamentary elections threaten, than now here, when there is, after all, almost a year and a half in the parliamentary elections? I don't think so. I think sir... Søren Egge Rasmussen's butt in his pants will be less next year than it is now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190002	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190004	Now we're in the situation that this heat check of DKK 6,000. for many households is not something that covers the increase they have been subjected to, so there is therefore a motivation to work on solutions that can make you get rid of your individual gas boiler. Well, we already have that situation. The fact that we then have a heating check, which means that fewer people have to leave home and home, seems to me to be a good help, for which I can actually clearly vouch, and which is well suited to the social policy we have in the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190040	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190042	Yeah, that's funny. That Enhedslisten will protect people from rising energy prices because they may not have such good advice; but Enhedslisten would like to put higher taxes on people who can't afford so they can't afford the cigarettes they feel they need. So, taxes that drive people from home and home and that they cannot afford the lifestyle they cultivate, Enhedslisten would like to put on, even though Enhedslisten knows that it hits people with low incomes hardest. But if it is the world market prices that are rising, then it is something terrible, and then they need a check.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190118	Mrs. Anne Paulin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190121	Thank you. Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen has already mentioned this, but I would like to ask a little of the same, namely that the rapporteur puts forward this argument that people should not have an incentive to switch to other energy sources when they get the heat check. However, will the rapporteur not confirm that the heat check is, after all, only a helping hand which covers a small part of the increase in energy prices experienced by those who get the heat check and that thus there will still be plenty of economic incentive for it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190156	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190157	I do not really know whether red bloc politicians really do not understand this, or whether they are trying to pretend that they do not understand it, i.e. the fact that people may well have an incentive to do something, but that you make that incentive less by giving them a check in order not to do so. Yes, there is an incentive, but the incentive is reduced because you decide that they must have a check if they do not. This leads to some, for whom the check is what determines that they do not do it anyway, while for others it doesn't matter that they get the check; they do it anyway.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190234	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190236	I don't think we're gonna get along on that. As I said, I have a little difficulty following that with the fact that there should not be an economic incentive. I think it is much more important that we should give impetus to this phasing out of the gas guys in people's homes and have district heating rolled in instead. So does the rapporteur not also see that it is much more important to speed up this development, which has therefore gone too slowly, also in municipal heating planning in recent years?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190314	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190315	Well, let's finally get this thing moving by removing the electricity tax, so people want to go on it, even if they have an electricity consumption below the 4,000 kWh per year. But it is rather strange that if you are red and want to vote for this bill, you simply do not understand the concept that incentives are one thing, but that a check creates a less incentive than if the cheque was not distributed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190344	Thank you, sir. Ole Birk Olesen. There are no more brief comments. Then we've come to the Minister of Climate, Energy and Supply. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190354	Thank you for that, and thank you for an exciting debate. Quite often, when you come to the Chamber and listen to your wise and honourable colleagues, you become a little wiser yourself, not least in their opinions and opinions. I have to say that this is not one of the cases that has taken place today. On the contrary, I have been confused at a higher level, compared to what bourgeois Denmark really wants. I know what they don't want. They wouldn't give 419,000 people a help of DKK 6,000. In the difficult situation we are in now they will not. I got it. But they do not provide an alternative. Yes, sir. Ole Birk Olesen does so, and he is quite open and idealistic from his own political perspective, in that he says that one should not subsidise at all, should not provide subsidies, because it will provide more incentives. I very much disagree with that is the right way to go, but I can respect the position because it is consistent. What is a little difficult to respect are the bourgeois people who say: your model, government and contractual parties are too complicated. And then you mention just ten additional factors that you would have liked to have included in the model. You are not giving enough, it sounds, and, incidentally, only funding has been presented, which will provide, when it is to be spread out on a much larger group of people, a much lower check. There is not yet a single concrete model from some of the bourgeois parties, and what comes close to a concrete model is so far away from everything the others in the bourgeois bloc want that you are not near having a majority in favour of it. And then we haven't even started talking about funding. Well, what we are now proposing to implement legislation on will allow us to help Danes, Danish families who are having a difficult time now in a truly unique situation. This is not something we think we should do every year. It is not a good thing that we have come to that, that we have to support people with fossil heat sources, but we recognise that the need is now there because we are in a very unique situation with historically high heat prices, a situation that has got worse by the crisis in Ukraine. That's why we choose to do what we do. It is also clear that this is, of course, linked to a more fundamental ambition that we will be completely away from the dependence on fossil sources of heat. There are far more people in Denmark who are going to district heating, and the district heating that we have must be green to a greater extent than it is today. Where it is not rational or where district heating is not available, individual heat pumps are often a good idea. We also believe that we should replace even more of the natural gas that we have in Denmark with biogas, so CO2 As regards those who have said why we are not just lowering electricity taxes, I can say that we have just made an agreement where we lowered electricity taxes; an agreement · in brackets noted ■ which most of the bourgeois parties in parentheses do not support. I think that if you are sitting at home listening to me, you might think that the Minister was talking about it, that is not possible, because the bourgeois parties have all just said that they want to lower the electricity tax. Yes, but nevertheless, they do not support the agreement we have just made to lower the electricity tax. So on the bottom line we have that the bourgeois will not give 419,000 Danish homes 6,000 kroner. We will. And we are doing so, while at the same time we have an ambition to do much more to phase out the fossil energy sources we are talking about, especially, of course, the gas. We are already negotiating on Friday to translate the 250 million. kr., we've set aside. After Easter, we are going to go much more thoroughly and look at what is also regulatory barriers, and what measures can be taken to get green district heating rolled out more. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190818	You're welcome. There are a few brief comments, and that is what Mrs Bjerre starts. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190822	Thank you. In the Left we would have liked to have a more simple model that had helped several Danes. I think it is quite clear what we wanted. We asked whether the money could not be given directly to the utilities, so they reduced the bill to the Danes who have high heating bills, but the government would not go that way. It has been made quite clear, and it has also been made clear in the notice that has been sent over, when we asked about it, that you do not want to do so, because you want to maintain that income graduation needs to be maintained. This has also made it clear that there is a very difficult state model, which hits the wrong side with all the injustices. I hope that the Minister will take with him some of the absurdities. Another thing I would like to ask is the democratic element in the fact that we now have only three days to deal with this bill. Does the Minister think that it is a dignified treatment of the Folketing that the Ministry has had 6 weeks to prepare the bill, while the Folketing now has 3 days to deal with it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190923	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405190924	However, it is well done that we should be accused that things are going too slowly, but at the same time that things are going too fast. We have given the clear signal to the official work, those who are doing the preparatory work, that we can deal with these matters, that they have to work as quickly as possible so that we can get ready to deal with it in the Folketing, and so that we can deal with it as quickly as possible, so that we can get the implementation going. That's what we've done. I note that the author's own President has said that if he were the one responsible, he would just say: you have to be paid more quickly. I don't know if the President of the Left was going to sit and code and make those data transfers, or if he was going to break the law in terms of legal protection, data protection. It's not a serious approach to this. I think it is quite fair to have different political views. You don't want to help 419,000 households with DKK 6,000, You'd rather give a less tax relief across the Danish population. Fair enough, it's a political choice. But to give the impression that we are not doing everything we can to make this go as smoothly and as quickly as possible is simply not factual. In any case, a plan must then be put forward as to what it was like to ensure that these data transfers could take place more quickly, that the IT system could be built more quickly and so on. etc.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191046	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191047	Could the Ministry have sent this bill to the Folketing earlier?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191055	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191056	Not if we were to be sure that it would also meet all the requirements and rules that exist and the political agreement that exists. It is clear that this is not a simple exercise, it goes without saying, and that is why it has been necessary to do the thorough preparatory work that has been done, which, moreover, is certainly an expression of hard work in the official work since we made the agreement and until now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191124	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191127	Now the Minister was just reflecting on the debate here, but I think it is to the credit of New Citizens that they said in a way that they will vote in favour of the bill. So I do not think that there was only civil courage in connection with this bill that has been sketched out. The Minister said that after Easter we will proceed much more thoroughly. I look forward to that, and I would like to know if there is any reason in the preparation for that meeting to assess the proposal made by the Danish District Heater to carry out a national screening in the geographical areas where there is gas firing, so that, as a matter of fact, it is possible to identify where there is a potential for the areas of district heating to be expanded and to find a model where a national screening is carried out and where, at the same time, there is also respect for municipal heating planning, so that the municipalities can look at it after the screening has been carried out. Is this something that is part of the Minister's preparations for the exciting meeting?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191228	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191229	I do not think it is just in this debate that I am going to give too many details about what we are going to propose exactly, but it is clear that we are of course listening to all stakeholders in the field and looking at all the knowledge that is out there. In general, I believe that there is a great deal of support in Denmark for district heating. We know that there are, because there are many people who are on district heating, but we also know that in these years more people are going on, and I think that the situation now with rising prices and the fact that for many people it is enough that the war in Ukraine has also made them want to be free of gas, only makes that interest greater.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191306	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191307	Yes, but now it has been said here, and then the minister can start that before we meet after Easter, it will be examined whether the screening solution proposed by the Danish District Heating Department last week was something that could be an element. I have also asked myself a question about the approx. 80 companies, which are district heating companies and are currently using gas. How can we specifically help them to accelerate some kind of transition? There you already have a district heating network, so you can help a lot of consumers quickly. The Minister may put some officials to look at that so that I do not come and am very angry at the meeting that I look forward to very much.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191347	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191348	I certainly didn't say I wouldn't look at it. I just said it was probably not here that we were going to discuss it. But I can also welcome the questioner that one hour before we met in this Chamber, I actually had a meeting with Danish District Heating, where we discussed the various good proposals they have. So the questioner can be quite confident that we're gonna turn every stone in this question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191408	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191410	If gas prices are also high next winter, does the government want to hand out a heat check again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191418	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191418-2	I cannot answer that at this stage.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191421	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191427	Then I will take that answer from the Minister for Energy as an answer that confirms that this will probably happen again when we are faced with a choice in 2023. Then the government, which today will not refuse to hand out a heat check again, will then just hand out a heat check again. So this isn't a one-time check, it's a repeat check. You set a political precedent for the fact that if it is expensive to fire with fossil fuels, then taxpayers will have to pay part of the bill via a heat check.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191503	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191504	I am warmed by the fact that the keynote of the questioner's speech here is that he certainly also expects a social democratic government to be in place for many years to come, otherwise that argument will not make any sense. I am addressing today what we have proposed here. What the world situation, including energy prices and the issue of war and peace in Europe, will look like next winter, I will not deal with it here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191534	Thank you very much to the Minister. No one else has brief comments or questions, and that is why the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Climate, Energy and Supply, and if none of you object, I consider it adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220405191554	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting except to thank everyone for their efforts in the service of the people's government. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Wednesday 6 April 2022, at 12.00 p.m. 13.00. I refer to the agenda set out in the Danish Parliament's website.
