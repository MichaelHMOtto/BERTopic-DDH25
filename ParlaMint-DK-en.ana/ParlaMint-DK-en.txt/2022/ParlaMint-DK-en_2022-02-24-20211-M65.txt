ParlaMint-DK_20220224190006	The meeting is open. I think I will take this opportunity to say a little about the process that I can see before me. It is the case that the foreign policy name is still going on. The expectation is that it may be over around 2:00 a.m. 7:30. When the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee is finished, it will be the case that I am presenting the resolution here from the platform, and then there will have to be a technical break of about 10 minutes, and then there can be a first reading of the resolution. Once we have finished the first reading of the resolution, it will have to go back to the Defence Committee, where the report will have to be written, and only then will we have to vote at second reading. So the times I can give here are, of course, subject to very, very great uncertainty, but my expectation is that about 1 p.m. We can be close to being able to deal first with the motion for a resolution. That is what I can say at this stage, so everyone must arm themselves with patience. I would just like to say that the sitting is suspended.
ParlaMint-DK_20220224192958	The sitting is resumed. The only thing to do in this sitting is to table motions for resolutions. President. - I call the Group of the European People's Party (Kofod Group). B 127 (Proposal for a Parliament resolution on the insertion of Danish military contributions to NATO's collective defence). The title of the notified case will appear in www.folketingstidende.dk (cf. above). There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held today at 1 p.m. 19.40.
