ParlaMint-DK_20220607130013	The meeting is open. The Minister for Health has informed me that he wishes to withdraw the following bill: Draft law amending the Health Act. 85 A). Does anyone wish to record this bill? As this is not the case, the draft law has lapsed. We must now proceed with today's votes and, as a service briefing, I would like to say that there are quite a lot of votes and also many votes on amendments. We must vote right up to the last second reading. That is why I will leave the vote A on and only if I see that there is a long-term debate will I turn off the A, but otherwise the A will be on. And then I think there are so many votes that we have to promise each other to be a little concentrated for the next 4, 5, 6 hours.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130122	The items listed as No. 23, 39, 40 and 42 on the agenda, can only be dealt with in this sitting with the agreement of the House. Are there any comments? It's a matter of course.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130127	The debate is closed and we shall proceed to the vote on the proposed amendments for adoption. There are four proposals. The vote shall be taken first on the motion for a resolution No. V 98 by Anne Paulin (S), Karsten Filsø (SF) and Søren Egge Rasmussen (EL). A vote can be taken. The vote will end. In favour of voting 45 (S, SF, EL and ALT), against voting 52 (V, RV, KF, DF, NB, LA, FG, Bent Bøgsted (UFG), Karina Adsbøl (UFG) and Nas Khader (UFG)), abstentions 0. Proposal for adoption No V 98 is rejected. The vote will then be taken on the motion for a resolution (Doc.

Proposal for adoption No The V 100 has been rejected. That concludes the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130342	No amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? As this is not the case, we shall proceed to the vote.

The bill has been passed unanimously and is being sent to the Prime Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130418	No amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? Mr. Lennart Damsbo-AndersenAndersen, Social Democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130435	Thank you, President. I am just so happy today, so I have to take the floor as well. It is a day of joy, because we are now improving the possibilities of obtaining mortgage loans throughout Denmark, including in the parts outside the major cities. For as long as I can remember, I have been a member of the rural district committee of the Folketing, and in all the years I, along with my very good colleagues from other parties here in Things, have drawn out in the country to see and hear what is going on out there... see it with my own eyes and hear the people who live out there, what they rejoice about, and what concerns them. One of the things that has always been at the top of the list of problems has been the lack of funding for housing. In a few moments, we will be adopting a legislative proposal which will enable us to finance rural housing in particular. So today is a day of joy. But it is also a day when we mark dividing lines in Danish politics. If we now press the voting buttons in a moment, everyone will see who really cares about rural areas and who does not. What surprises me most is that the Left chooses to vote against. I've never doubted and I don't doubt where my good colleagues, sir. Hans Christian Schmidt and Mr. Peter Juel-Jensen-Jensen is in this case. That is probably why it is not the Left's rural rapporteur who has this case or has had it in the Chamber; it is the completely unknown Mrs Heidi Bank in the rural context. On the other hand, it is also a clear indication that the Left is no longer focused on rural areas. It does not shy away from the fact that I am very pleased that today we can show here in the Folketing who takes rural areas seriously. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130650	This gave rise to a number of brief comments. First, it's from sir. Thomas Danielsen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130658	The Socialist rapporteur does not need to be so surprised that it is the Left Housing Rapporteur who has the bill. However, I would like to ask a few questions about the state loan that the rapporteur prides himself on. I just need to confirm whether it is not true that the loans will be more expensive than other loans in the area, that is to say that we must not make state loans that can compete with private loans, and therefore we must now make more expensive loans for rural areas, and that when we have to make a credit rating on the free market, that is to say, our mortgages, for which we have a system that is quite unique in Denmark, we must do neighboring checks, and if the rapporteur then has a mortgage, and I am the rapporteur's neighbour, but I have a state loan, the rapporteur will next time the rapporteur has to have a loan, be neighborly checked, why the rapporteur's credit institution can then see that hoov, the rapporteur's neighbour is Mr. Thomas Danielsen and he have a loan on dilapidated peasants in the province, which is a state loan, and that ergo it is an area that has been plagued by the loans now, which is why the rapporteur must also be taken into account for a loan.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130805	Thank you. Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130807	Actually, I'm really glad that Mr. Knox... Thomas Danielsen is asking some questions here, because I think it is important in such a case as this to correct such completely erroneous perceptions of what we are talking about. First of all, it is not a state loan. It is a state guarantee for a mortgage, and it is not a state loan. And you still have to get away as a citizen and as a homeowner to meet the standard criteria for obtaining a mortgage. So says Mr. Thomas Danielsen, that the loans will be more expensive. They don't. What is happening here is that you get the opportunity to get a loan at all. What we are talking about here are people who are not able to get a mortgage today, as the terms are now, when the mortgage chooses to say no, and then with this bill we allow the state to guarantee that part of the loan goes from 50 to 90%. of the value of the dwelling. And then you have to stop it... well, I can answer that in a moment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130910	We'll take that at another time. Here you go again, sir. Thomas Danielsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130913	If the rapporteur can then just clarify. Can the rapporteur deny that this makes funding more expensive in rural areas? Or can the rapporteur guarantee that it will not be more expensive in rural areas? Perhaps it is more correct to ask.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130928	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607130930	There are never any guarantees, but I can at least guarantee that the intention is that it should be cheaper. For the alternative for the people who today cannot get a mortgage is, of course, and we know that from out there, when you have talked to good people, either to go to the bank, and then the bank says: you cannot get a mortgage, but we would very much like to give you a bank loan, it costs just 8%. or 9%. at interest rates that you have to pay instead of giving 1⁄2%. or 3%, or whatever the rate is today. A third alternative is that you have to go to the mortgage market, and it is not cheaper either. So it is quite natural for the people we are talking about here to be cheaper than their alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131004	Mrs. Heidi Bank, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131013	Thank you. After all, it is good to hear that the rapporteur is passionate about it, because it is actually a common interest that we have in Denmark, namely that we should have the country hanging together and that we should do well to live throughout the country. That is why I think it is unwise for the rapporteur to make this point that the Left suddenly does not want rural areas, because it is simply nonsense. This is about wanting solutions that ultimately do no more harm than they benefit and that there are the right balances in the solutions you make. The fact is that when mortgage banks have to look at these areas, they have to look at the value of the mortgage. In fact, it is to ensure that those who buy properties in rural areas also have a solid private economy forward-looking and that they do not suddenly have something that is unsellable. So what we have been asking for, and we have been asking for this from the outset, has been that there was openness on the part of the government and that negotiations were invited. What happened instead on the part of the government was that there was a move on a half-A4 side and there have been zero negotiations in this area. So the Left would have liked to bid in, and I want to hear again what you want to say to those people in relation to the value of the mortgage.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131123	Now we need an answer from the rapporteur. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131125	I mean, this is very technical, but I think it is important to discuss who really wants something good for rural areas. If the Left is now at first reading of this proposal, for example. had come up with some alternative proposals on what had to be changed in the draft law, that would have been an opportunity. What I have heard in the debates in this Chamber is that the Left has rejected it from day one and has not at any time made any constructive proposals as to what should have been done. And I don't think of it as an outstretched hand. I consider it more like that you do not want to be in and do not want to be part of the parties that will ensure that you can borrow with mortgages throughout the country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131207	Mrs. Heidi Bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131209	I have to say that the rapporteur contradicts himself. The rapporteur stands and highlights one rapporteur from the Left after another as some who have been working for rural areas for years. Why should the Left have changed its mind? Well, we haven't changed our mind. We continue to do so, and we are doing so in relation to the law of plans at the moment, where we are fighting for just a little bit to be given: what is being said from the platform is not true. That's bullshit. And I don't think it's fair if you want to have a Denmark where we think about the whole country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131239	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131240	I started by saying here in my speech that I have traveled land and rich around with good people from the Left. All the people in the Left are good; it's not like that. But I have never doubted the support of the Left in terms of wanting to ensure better lending opportunities throughout the country never before. That is why I was deeply, deeply surprised and also shocked when we had the first reading of this proposal in the House that the Left suddenly marks a completely different position.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131314	Then it's mr. Peter Juel-Jensen-Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131323	Thank you. And thank the rapporteur for taking the floor. I would say that I do not normally know the rapporteur in this way, because normally I think that the rapporteur always has substance and will in what is being said. There's no such thing here. As to the reason why we do not want to be involved, I can say that this is the way we have got to the point. After all, we have tried, through a technical review, to find out what this is all about and we have tried to make improvements. But we've got a blank no all the way through. This is not going to mean that more money is being borrowed in rural areas. There can be no guarantees, the rapporteur himself said. These are just empty words; they are something that will not help anything, plus that it will be more expensive to borrow in rural areas. Finally, if you want to do something in rural areas, you should not make an A and B team where the A team is inside the big cities, and the B team are those in rural areas who have to pay more for things. The rapporteur is on the wrong track here. Can the rapporteur guarantee that this will mean that no one will be refused forward?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131419	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131421	To take the latter first, I certainly do not think it is possible to guarantee that no one will be refused because we still have to assess whether we have the economy in order, i.e. whether we, as a buyer, meet the criteria. But I think that, in the situation we have today, we have out there, where I live; out there, where the rapporteur lives, we know that there are people who today cannot get a mortgage, because they get no if they want to buy a home. And it is not because they do not have money because they do not have the economy in order; it is simply because it is a wrong postal code. And then I know that in the financial world people say that this is not the reality they are familiar with. No, but they record nothing in relation to refusal, which is why we cannot trust what is being said at all. We know only from the conversations we have had with ordinary citizens that they are refused refusals which have nothing to do with their economy, but only have something to do with where they live. And that's why we already have an A and a B team today. That is what we need to put right.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131523	Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen-Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131525	Well, if we already have an A and B team and we will also continue to have an A and B team, why didn't we accept our offer to read in the Minister's mailbox so that we could see what challenges you are facing as a potential borrower and what barriers you are knocking against? There, together with the rest of the blue parties and with Finans Danmark, we offered that we could sit down together and find the right solution. But the government wanted to be alone. And now they say we're the ones who don't want to be in it. It is the government that has failed to cooperate. It is the government that has failed to think solutions across the middle.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131559	Here you go, rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131600	I think it would have been comfortable for the Left in this situation to say: okay, now we go into it and then try to be in it. After all, it is a three-year scheme. Then you can see in three years how you'll see it. What I think is important about this is that we give a hand to everyone in Denmark who lives outside the major cities so that they have the opportunity to get mortgages.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131620	Sir. Erling Bonnesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131622	Thank you. I also find it very regrettable and strange that we could not be allowed to take a look at all the citizens' concerns that have arisen in relation to what problems there are. We have no idea how many that is. It is normal, then, that when you have a debate, you can see what has been signed in. I can now understand that the fine words that the rapporteur himself said from the outset are not true, because the rapporteur has already replied to the previous question: we cannot now guarantee that anyone who is denied a mortgage can subsequently obtain a State-guaranteed loan. Some have already been left out there. The government must have clear answers there already. I mean, I almost read that this case has been lost to the government before it has even been voted through. For many of them, as it was intended, can already look at the guide for it, because they do not get a loan anyway.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131710	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131711	No, it should be borne in mind that in this case, as in the past, it is a matter of being able to meet the general criteria for approval and recognition as a house buyer in order to obtain a mortgage. There is no change in that. What's the difference here is that where you can see that the credit union doesn't want to go all the way, you have the opportunity to make this solution where there's a state guarantee on the last part. That is what should help some of the house buyers to get the opportunity to buy a home, which they cannot do today. Then the questioner also asks about the letters that have been sent to the Minister. As far as I recall, I can now speak on behalf of the Minister. There have been replies to the requests made by the Left to the Minister. And the people who have written to the Minister have done so in confidence that the papers that they send are treated confidentially and are not shown out it is wrong to say to everyone or to the public. That's why it shouldn't be shown in this case either. Then you have to ask in another way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131821	Thank you for that! Then it's mr. Erling Bonnesen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131823	Well, it's a confession case. In other words, the rapporteur has just said that not everyone gets loans. They say that you are doing something now, and you can sort of rewrite it as a kind of garbage bin loan that you can get into. In concrete terms, it could be that some new customers came to the bank, which could actually document equity and all and which would normally be able to borrow money. They get a "no" from a credit institution, and then they get sent across the street, or they can apply for this government-guaranteed loan. It's not gonna bring the case to the fore.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131859	Thank you. Then it is the rapporteur. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131901	What I think is the important thing to think about in this matter is that we are creating a real opportunity for those who are denied today to be able to test whether they can get a mortgage with a state guarantee, and that is where the Left chooses not to be in it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131913	Then it is Mrs Anni Matthiesen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607131918	Thank you. And thank you to the rapporteur. Yes, the rapporteur and I have at least been sitting in the Committee on Rural Development for the ten years that the committee has been in existence, and this is a battle we have fought and I recognise it, but what really upsets me is that with the solution that the government has now come up with, it is in this way that we are now really making an A and B team. For those people who now have to have a state guarantee quite frankly risk spreading to neighbouring houses as well, which means that those areas will then turn into black spots on the map. I simply cannot understand that. So would the rapporteur not agree with me that the system here, which the government is now implementing, is precisely creating visible A and B teams?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132013	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132016	I think we have very visible A and B teams already today. If you look at the Danish map and see where mortgages are promised, you can see that there is an A and B team and that there are postal numbers and areas in Denmark where it is virtually impossible to obtain a mortgage. And I don't know how you could imagine that this situation would make it worse. What is going to happen is that, in future, some of those who are being refused today will receive an undertaking, that is to say, when we are voting on it in a few moments and when the Left then votes against it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132043	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132045	Just in the end, would I like the rapporteur to answer yes or whether it will be more expensive for these citizens to take these loans yes or no?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132055	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132058	For those citizens who have the opportunity to buy a property and who are in the situation we are talking about here, it will be cheaper. For the alternative for them is either a mortgage or a pure bank loan, and in both cases it is more expensive than the mortgage they will get here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132111	Then it's mr. Bent Bøgsted, outside the groups.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132116	Thank you for that, President. I think the rapporteur can confirm that it is nothing new that it is up to us to guarantee loans in rural areas. It was up to the previous government to turn over under the Helle Thorning-Schmidt-regering-Schmidt government, and there has been a long process along the way. The point is that a couple in a small local town up near me in North Jutland, who had an income of DKK 650,000, bought a house of DKK 250,000, and they could not get a mortgage; their economy was in order, but the house was in the wrong place. They then took a bank loan and tried it out, and of course they live there today and are happy with the house. But it is not the case that you can get that loan if you don't have the economy to pay off and interest. I assume the rapporteur can confirm that this helps those who have the economy to buy but can't get a mortgage because the house is in the wrong place.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132210	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132211	I would like to confirm that, and I can say that the rapporteur is absolutely right. Sir. Bent Bøgsted describes very precisely the situation with the family who gets a refusal and where you think: What on earth is going on here? We have heard countless examples of these stories over recent years, and some governments have tried to do something about it, but that has not been possible. Now we have a proposal where there is a chance of really going in and doing something, and that will also happen, because there is a majority in favour of this. I just note that the party in here, which also declares itself to be a rural party, is actually voting against it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132248	Sir. Bent Bøgsted.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132250	Because this is also about families who say they want to move out of a big city they live in an apartment and have two or three children and buy a cheap house out in a village. They need cars, because they have to go to work, but there is a lot more surplus for the children by buying a house out in a village and renovating it, plus that the village gets a boost because someone wants to do something about the houses. Then they can't get a mortgage, but they can do so here with a guarantee, but they must of course first ask the mortgage. It's not like you're per. This is the first time we have to try the other way forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132326	Thank you. Then it is the rapporteur. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132329	The situation described here by the rapporteur is also very significant for the time we live in, when there are actually several families who want to move out, and then you land a place with a postal code where you cannot live out the dream you actually have of moving out of town and living one that you can say freer lives with higher to heaven, that is, because the postal number is wrong and then you are denied the mortgage. But now there's gonna be a chance to do that with this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132358	Well, then, sir. Orla Hav of the Social Democratic Party asked for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132404	Yes, I do. I would like to ask the rapporteur whether he thinks that referring to the type of loans as state-guaranteed loans to decrepit farmers in rural areas is a fair way of describing it. That's how it is, sir. Thomas Danielsen mentioned this type of house. I know a lot of people who are happy to live in a good place in a rural area and have a good and solid house that they cherish. Does the rapporteur think that having it characterised as decrepit peasants in rural areas is a fair way of mentioning it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132436	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132437	No, actually, I do not think so, and I also think that it may have been a statement from Mr. Thomas Danielsen's side, when he says as he has done, too far, the vast majority of houses in rural areas in Denmark are actually nice, and they are neither dilapidated nor greens, but it is just houses that are in some postal numbers in areas where there is no possibility of getting a mortgage. They're so cheap, and it may be, that's why I shouldn't be able to say that, but they're certainly not fallacious.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132506	Sir. Orla Hav, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132511	My concern was that this paradigm shift, which has apparently taken place in the Left, is that one characterises houses located in different places as falling or rowing or something else if they are not located in the right place, and I think that the Left should have the opportunity to correct that that is not what one is going for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132530	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132533	I can then pass the call on to the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132537	I can say that, very soon after the sitting here, you can see exactly what the rapporteur and others have said in this Chamber. So that can be resolved quickly. Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132549	Thank you. The rapporteur has now said in an answer that the intention is that it should not be more expensive for people who today have a mortgage in our rural areas. I always get worried when the government and the Social Democrats talk about intentions, because then it often seems to me that the government is doing something that it hopes and believes looks right, although it may well be concerned about the consequences. The consequence is that, as several people have said, there is an extremely high risk that state-guaranteed loans will now become the norm in our rural areas, and the loans guaranteed by the state are not a free round, they are more expensive loans, and this means that this proposal has a very, very high risk that people who are receiving a loan today will in future be able to look forward to being faced with a demand for a state guarantee on that loan and thus look forward to a higher payment for their loans. I just cannot understand that the Socialist rapporteur does not recognise that issue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132650	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132652	It can't be a problem for people who have a mortgage, because this is about you getting these loans when you buy a house, not when you have one already. As far as I can recall, we are talking about this state guarantee costing in the region of 225 kroner. a month, that is to say, in order to be allowed to have a state guarantee. It will also be the case that the credit union will also have to bear part of the burden of taking a risk on this. There will, of course, be a general assessment, just as we are doing today, i.e. whether the buyer is creditworthy, whether you can enter into a housing trade, whether it is possible to provide a normal mortgage loan, and if it is not, you can get into the second section called the State guarantee on a mortgage loan. I do not see at all that this is going to be more expensive, I only see that this is going to be an opportunity for those people who today do not have access to a mortgage to have one in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132755	Torst Schack Pedersen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132757	If the Social Democrats were so sure that there was no risk of this spreading and that people who do not need a state guarantee would also be met with it as a requirement and thus have a mortgage that is more expensive than what they would otherwise have to take, yes, if not the doubt of the Social Democratic Party, why is it that this alone is a 3-year trial period?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132823	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132824	I would really like to start somewhere else, because one of the reasons why I am not concerned is that the mortgage credit institution should also bear a part of the burden, because it is not, but that is the chance to give the mortgage credit under these conditions. After all, they get 10%. of the 30% that they have to take, and therefore I do not believe that anyone will go into this without it being possible to see that it makes sense to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132855	Thank you to the rapporteur. No one else has asked for short comments, so now it is Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt, SF, as rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607132911	Thank you for the floor. It may not be a good idea here before the summer recess to extend the debates, as we are going to vote for a very long time, but I still think that this proposal should have some nice words on the way. We have, as we have seen in the SF since 2014, when we made the first proposal, said that market forces are simply not going to solve the problem we see with the absence of mortgages in certain rural areas. Five times we have put forward a proposal in which we have appealed to different kinds of solutions, and now there is actually a bid to solve the challenges of missing mortgages in rural areas, and we very much welcome this. For us, it is about the people who live in rural areas. It is a huge bomb in the safety of the people who live in rural areas if they cannot put their houses into circulation. What if you get divorced, get unemployed, or what if you get old enough and need to get out of your house and into a rental home? So there are some places where it is not an option where people simply have to be carried out with their legs first if they are going from there, and I just think that is not fair. For me, it is about a Denmark that is linked, for me it is about justice, for me it is about a fair balance between country and city. It has been said in the debate that it is not a question of giving loans to houses that are deceptive or to buyers that are not creditworthy. This must be done under exactly the same conditions as those applied today to ordinary mortgage institutions. What is different is that the state takes part in the risk, and that is not something that we are completely unaware of. I think it is the Growth Fund and the Export Credit Fund, where the state also goes in and guarantees and guarantees. It is not a principle that we are unaware of, i.e. that the state is taking part in the risk, and I think, unfortunately, that we need to do so if we are going to solve this problem. Then there has also been talk of the price. Is it gonna be more expensive? Yeah, it's gonna be more expensive, but it sure isn't a lot of money. I myself have asked about a committee question, and I think the Left is also aware of what it really costs more to borrow 1 million. kr. Yeah, it's in the neighborhood of 200 kroner, and I think I can live with that. But what does it really cost more if you have to finance it bypassing the bank, which is the alternative in which you can risk being pushed? That's $1,670. more a month. So I believe that access to a fair, stable and proper loan will mean a great deal to the people who live in rural areas. Then it has also been mentioned here in the debate and the questions that we do not want an A and a B team. But, dear friends, it already exists, and so it is the security of some people that this is about in rural areas. If we do not do this, it will put a brake on life, growth and development. And yes, we can discuss that we should do something else, but we have been discussing this for eight years since we put forward the first proposal. This isn't a turn that we can just make by setting some changed framework conditions. We must do the same, but this is an absolutely necessary proposal. My only fear in this may be that there are mortgage institutions that say, despite the fact that the state will not take part in the responsibility, we do not want to work with state-guaranteed loans. However, I find it difficult to imagine that there will be mortgage institutions, since at last some of the responsibility will be lifted by those who should be so unsolidarian that they will end up saying no and will not participate in a system of state-guaranteed loans. It will be a huge failure in rural areas. I would like to conclude the debate by saying a huge thank you to the government for finally getting something done about this issue. Then we'll see how far we get with the solutions. I have not, in the time I have been rapporteur in this area, heard better offers of solutions, and that is indeed for a while. I think this will have an impact on rural areas and, above all, it will give hope to the many people who are challenged to buy and sell their housing in rural areas. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133350	There is a brief comment. Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen-Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133355	Thanks for the speech. I attached myself to two words: justice and balance. The rapporteur recognizes that it will be more expensive to take this type of loan if you live in a rural area. Does the rapporteur still think that the proposal and the proposal that lie here are a fair proposal and a proposal that brings better balance when it is now more expensive to borrow in rural areas than in urban areas?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133422	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133423	I think it would simply be fair and, indeed, balanced if you had to pay 200 kroner. more a month, unlike the 1,670 DKK you have to pay bypass the bank, if you are fortunate enough to get a loan through bypassing the bank. It is also more often in a very, very short period of payment. So I think this makes a lot of sense, and I have not heard any proposals from the Left in terms of how we can solve this. So that's the best guess that for me is right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133454	Peter Juel-Jensen-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133456	But perhaps we could have made a better proposal together if the rapporteur had agreed with the Left that it would have been a good idea for us to look into the replies that the Minister had received from his mailbox so that we could find the best possible solution to this problem. But the rapporteur would not. You just liked what was in there. How many will continue to be denied their loan applications after we have adopted them here, in the rapporteur's own words, very good proposals that push rural areas forward, but which are, in fact, also a proposal that makes it more expensive to borrow?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133533	Thank you. The rapporteur. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133534	Well, it is clear that there are some who are outside the scope of the proposal here, but it is probably an attempt to find out where the balance should be, and that is probably why we have to evaluate in three years' time to see if we found the right balance. I have just not heard any good proposals from the Left on how this proposal could look different, and so I actually think that the Left is abandoning rural areas here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133555	Then it's mr. Thomas Danielsen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133604	Thank you. There was a wish from the previous speaker that I elaborate on what I meant by the expression "dwindling peasants." The request came after I did not have any more brief comments, which is why I should like to take this opportunity to elaborate on it. What I said was that state loans/state guarantees risk becoming a plague spreading in the province in the houses that were the dilapidated rowers. This is because there are people who today have mortgages, who are suddenly required to take a state guarantee, because it has been decided to do so in the province, and why should mortgage banks not? So that is the point that the Socialist rapporteur did not accept, but I am glad that the SF is honest and says: yes, this is going to be more expensive for those who have to borrow in the province and who today have a regular mortgage. So thank you for SF's honesty.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133655	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133657	I have no problem with admitting that, because if we continue, as the Left wants, to make no arrangements, it will cost DKr 1,670. a month outside the bank by a loan of 1 million. kr., and it will cost 200 kr. extra with this loan. I think this is much more fair and it reflects the higher risk. Then I would say that in my first motion for a resolution I was inspired by Norway, which has the Husbanken, where the state is also granting loans, and I have not seen that as such massive black spots have developed on the map. So I think that's a fear that's completely unfounded. We are today giving guarantees or guarantees from the state to companies that need loans. Nor has it given black spots on the company card, and there are some who say they won't touch the companies with a fang because they have got the wrong loan or guarantee. That's crazy. So let's see how this goes, and then we can evaluate it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133800	Sir. Thomas Danielsen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133802	One might also ask the other way round: what would the argument be for mortgage credit institutions not to require a State guarantee in order to reduce their risks? There is even today a requirement for them to carry out neighboring checks. This means that they must not ignore the fact that someone who currently has a regular mortgage has a neighbour who has a State guarantee. They must not ignore that. They have to take that into account in their credit rating. That is the law today. So what would the argument be for them not to impose on the next person in the rural district also to take an expensive state guarantee on top of the loan they have today?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133840	Then we shall have answers from the rapporteur. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133842	We can also turn it around and say that if we have an area where mortgage loans are virtually not offered, will it not be a large black spot where the rings will spread even more? During the 2015 election campaign, I was with Carl Holst in a village called Gabøl and is located in South Jutland and there was among the most recently sold houses not a single house in the town that was financed in the normal way. I think that is a huge problem. Then people had to resort to all sorts of other arrangements, and that is where we end up if we do not give them the opportunity to get a state-guaranteed loan.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133914	Then it's Mrs. Heidi Bank, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607133918	Thank you and thank you for a rapporteur's speech, which I actually thought there was some honesty in recognising that there are in fact some huge problems with the scheme that the SF supports. One of the things that has now been repeated several times from the platform is that it is much more expensive if you are to have a different system, so it compares it with the most expensive one can find at all. However, the rapporteur also advocates market conditions and does not recognise that someone cannot buy a property because they simply cannot obtain loans for it, because the mortgage is not strong enough to give it a loan, that then you might be denied that property, and that it may be that you have received such a refusal that it was better that this was the way we went, rather than going in and making state-guaranteed loans and requiring a buyer to pay 225 kroner. every month over the next 30 years?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134010	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134011	I just think I have to say that I see a huge and massive problem with areas that have turned into black spots, at least mortgage we hear at least time and again the stories of people who are told that they cannot get a loan in some village, but that if they move into the nearest larger city, they can get a loan, and I think that is just a problem for rural development. I don't have the big quabble with this scheme. I do not have the big quabble with the fact that the loan will be a tiny bit more expensive when we are still giving the loans to buyers who are safe and who have the economy in order and to houses that are in order. I believe that this may be some of the things that can help create some security and some security for the citizens who live in rural areas, and I think that if I owned a house in the wrong place, I would be really worried about whether I was divorced or unemployed or so old that I had to move to a nursing home because it is actually not possible to translate the house.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134113	Mrs. Heidi Bank, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134115	I just have to say that this is a false security you give out there. Well, this is because you have a mortgage and that mortgage has to be assessed one way or the other. When you go in and make a state guarantee, you go in and make a false premise, and you have even done so in the way that you have said that we are now testing it for three years. Well, excuse me, we buy houses because we're gonna live in them for many, many years. These are huge life decisions, and one of our concerns in the Left is that we have buyers where we want to be sure that their economy is also in the long run.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134148	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134150	Perhaps I would have liked this scheme to continue for more than three years, but we are going to evaluate it, and I hope that there will be a basis for it to continue if there is anything we can do about it. But I have the impression that it didn't matter to the Left how far this arrangement extends over how long it is then. I suppose that's because the Left doesn't actually like the word "state guarantee" and that's what triggers this whole question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134218	Mrs Anni Matthiesen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134222	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. When you live in a village, as I do, I can say that what I am worried about by this scheme is that if we now say that there are actually ten people in my village who are in a situation where they have to have a state guarantee in order to get a loan at all, then there is a tendency that when you know that in this postcode, in this village, there are more people who have to have a state guarantee, you might not dare to invest in or renovate your own house. I am therefore afraid that the black spots are actually growing and getting bigger and also spreading to the neighbors. Does the rapporteur not recognise this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134311	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134314	I think this really is a dilemma. Right now, there are some people who can't convert their houses. Then there are some others who can, and they will also be able to do so with this proposal, because mortgage credit institutions will have an interest in financing what is cheapest for them under perfectly normal conditions and where they consider the risk to be lower. I am more concerned about the group which simply cannot be allowed to convert their house. And that's why there are some dilemmas in this, but let's try this arrangement for three years. Let us see what it actually does remedy and whether there are things that should have been different. Well, then we'll have to try to pick it up. At any rate, I think that the alternative is worse: we are abandoning the people who cannot put their house into action today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134401	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134403	The rapporteur says: now we are trying to do this and then let us follow it up. Has the rapporteur's party made sure, when you follow up, that you also have something to follow up on? Because if it turns out in three years that these spots have actually grown instead, then I guess it's not a success, and I guess you should stop it quickly. I mean, what I'm thinking is, when you evaluate this, have you made sure you have something to evaluate on?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134433	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134436	Well, I guess we're gonna get some information about whether this scheme is being used. What are some zip codes it will be used in particular? So I guess there's plenty to evaluate in a few years. But Mrs Anni Matthiesen can say what it is she thinks should be evaluated on. Then I am sure that we can also be willing to stop it into an evaluation. I have only one interest, and that is that this scheme will be good and that it will address the concerns that people have in rural areas, so let us look at it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134503	Sir. Erling Bonnesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134506	Thank you. Well, it is now made clear that not everyone gets a refusal to have a regular mortgage which would then rather be able to have it with the State guarantee. What, then, are the rapporteur and the SF's answers to the many who, after all, are still left with reasonable equity or payouts, but who cannot get a regular mortgage or a state guarantee? What's the answer to them?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134523	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134527	After all, this scheme takes care of the places where the square meter prices are lowest and is based on what can be said to understand where you think people have the most problems in getting a loan. But we haven't had such a loan scheme here before, and it's been extremely difficult to obtain data in this area. Sir. Erling Bonnesen himself knows that it has really been problematic. We are just constantly hearing the stories about people who have not been able to borrow to the house they would like, and that is why some balances have been put into this proposal, which is about the lowest square metre prices, and where you have to assume that it will be hardest to translate a house. We also know from real estate agents that they support the fact that these problems exist out there. So, yes, there are some who will fall outside the scheme. It is clear that there are two criteria that have been included in it, which is also about the square meter price.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134622	Sir. Erling Bonnesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134624	Well, what exactly is the answer to them? Because that is what I asked for, that is, that some people still have a reasonable equity or payout, and it does not have to be very large, because it is typically a little cheaper houses but cannot get one or the other. We still need an answer to that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134639	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134640	But it may well be that there are some who fall outside the scheme, because there are some criteria. But I have the impression that it does not matter for the Left, because the Left votes no. Left doesn't like a state guarantee. I think it is a pity for rural areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134652	Sir. Bent Bøgsted, outside the groups.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134655	Thank you. You can get a little tired of the debate that is going on, about how much loans you need and the prices of the houses. In North Jutland, where I come from, these are the places where there are problems, not built up on zip numbers. It may be that there are some small villages under the same postal code where they cannot get loans, but in the largest city of perhaps 1,200-1,500 inhabitants they can get loans, and that is typically the prices of houses out in the small villages from DKK 200,000 to DKK 600,000, it is whether they cannot get funding. Then they can get a bank loan at 8-10 percent. instead of a mortgage loan of 2-3 per cent, and that is where the large savings are if they can get a State guarantee. Then they can get a mortgage for maybe 2 or 3 per cent, instead of it being expensive bank loans at 8-10 per cent. For banks also assess their credit rating and what areas they need to borrow in, and no one can enter the bank and get a bank loan at 3 to 4 per cent. To buy a house.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134758	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134802	Well, that's absolutely right, and I couldn't have said it better myself. There are just some people who live in wrong places within certain postal numbers, where there may also be places where you give lots of mortgages on very common terms, and that is just a challenge, and I think it does something about security. After all, we all need to be able to translate it if our living conditions change. If we get older, if we divorce, if we become unemployed, then we need to be able to convert a house and have the security in it and also have it at a reasonable, cheap, fair price, and that is what I think this proposal is about. Although I recognise that the Outdoor Bank is taking on a responsibility where mortgages are failing, I am sorry that people have to be driven into its arms if you could have obtained a mortgage with a state guarantee that was cheaper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134902	Thank you. Bent Bøgsted.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134904	Thank you. I think the rapporteur recognizes this, because if there is a very good house out in a small village, they could perhaps get 350,000-400,000 kroner. for it, if mortgage loans are granted. If you cannot get it, you may not be able to sell the house, and then it is, it may be going to go down and not be maintained because you cannot get rid of it or any thing, and at some point it will come to where no one wants it anyway. But if you get a mortgage, you also have the opportunity to improve the house so that it becomes attractive to live in the small village.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134936	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134938	Yeah, that's absolutely right. After all, a mortgage provides security and security, and I think we actually owe that to the people who live in rural areas. Because otherwise it's the demolition pool that's gonna take next time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607134951	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments, and I should like to know if there are any more who would like to speak on behalf of L 116. There is not, and then we shall proceed to the vote.

ParlaMint-DK_20220607135145	No amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? Mr. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607135205	Thank you, President. I shall be very brief. We are talking a lot about personal freedom here, but not so much about personal independence, and there is reason to do so, at least in this area where we in the Danish People's Party are very happy that we have now succeeded, on a small corner of social policy, in abolishing the regulation on income from the spouse of folk, senior and early retirement. It is a battle that has been going on for so many years and that we are glad to have succeeded here. Not that we are fully in line, because there are certainly other areas where regulation between spouses should be removed, should be changed and that fight continues. I just want to thank, in addition to thanking those whom we have been able to make this agreement with the President, also with the permission of the President, those citizens who are working so hard for this matter. It is a pleasure to stand shoulder to shoulder with people from civil society, so also thank you for being here today. Thank you, President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607135306	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. That is why we are moving forward in the rapporteur's line, and then it is Mrs Victoria Velasquez, the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607135314	Oh, my God, I got butterflies in my stomach. What is about to happen today is great; it is historic. Here in this briefcase there are hundreds of people's stories that represent thousands of people. It is about the lack of dignity that you experience when you are made financially dependent on your spouse. There's a big difference between these stories, but they're just about the unequal dynamics it can create, compared to always having to ask for permission if you need to spend some money; it's the lack of financial security, fighting with Payout Denmark and the uncertainty about how much you're going to be set off because your partner or spouse has taken a few extra hours. This is an expression of completely insane rules and a misguided view that we should not be self-employed, that we should be made economically dependent on each other. These are stories of child poverty, because the principles of mutual dependents do not take into account how many families of children are affected by it. It is people who are alone who dare not choose the love of, because they are afraid to feel like a burden. It's a lot of stories that are about to be turned around. I think it's historic, because when I look, I can't help but smile with former members of the Folketing in here, Mrs. Line Barfod, sir. Finn Sørensen and many others, for the fight to abolish the principles of mutual dependency has been both in 2003 and 2013. But now, when we get to 2023, it looks like the third decade is the decade of luck. But what is the difference between the previous times that we have fought against the principles of the mutual dependent until now? With the permission of the President, I think I will take the liberty of pointing to the citizens who have fought. It is about the creation of a hugely strong movement, in which people, among other things, have been created. the hundreds of people here have actually chosen to take and say away and say it out loud and not be poor, but actually take the strength that is in standing together and saying things out loud. I think this is proof that when we stand together, we're stronger. We can do much more when we do things together than when we do things alone. I know we're not in the finish line. We still have to abolish the principles of mutual dependents elsewhere, but this is a huge step. And at the time many voted against the citizens' motion or our motion for a resolution, people said: this is an impossible battle; it cannot be done. But it just proves that if you keep fighting, it can be done. And it gives real zeal to the future battles. So thank you to all of you who have used your voice and who have dared to turn it, that you are made a poor man, to be strong. It's very inspiring. And when we go down in a minute and vote and I press the button, you will be involved in pressing to vote for us to now abolish much of the principles behind the mutual dependent. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607135638	Thank you to the rapporteur. Then it's mr. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607135649	Thank you, President. I think I've stood on this platform 400 times now, and it's just so rare that you just walk up to joy. What I welcome is the fact that in this draft law, among other things, we are about to vote on in a few moments, it says: the abolition of income regulation on early retirement and retirement on account of the earnings of spouses or couples. In other words, we are now abolishing what is called the reciprocal or partner-dependent set-off. In the alternative, we call it love treasure. It is the case that less dear children also have many names. But like I said, I've just come up here to enjoy that people outside the Castle can make things happen in here if you work hard enough for it. Abolition of the love tax means, of course, that you are set off in your benefit if you are an early retirement, a pensioner, a senior pensioner, if you find love. The first to propose its removal were, after all, the citizens who wrote B 34, who were a citizen's proposal, and it is the citizens' proposal that has ever received the most signatures. Then there was a long collaboration between activists outside the Folketing and politicians inside the Folketing, of which I myself am incredibly happy and proud to have been a part. Together with Enhedslisten, for example, the Alternative put forward: motion for a resolution on the abolition of mutual dependents. We have had plenty of consultations and consultations and discussions. Just in the alternative, we've asked over 70 questions about this case. In order to make a long story short, it has certainly been possible to ensure that a lot of people do not have to be put into retirement, early retirement, senior pension if they fall in love with someone who has a job. This bill costs a lot of money, and it means a lot to a lot of Danes. But we have succeeded, and I will end by thanking the citizens who have taken up this fight, because you, in particular, have worked this victory through. So thank you for that, and thank you for that. Now all we need in this category is the abolition of mutual dependents for married cash benefits recipients, so of course we are working on that in the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607135905	Thank you to the rapporteur. I should like to know if anyone else wishes to speak. There is no such thing, and that is why we are going to vote.

ParlaMint-DK_20220607141350	No amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? The tax minister does. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607141403	Thank you. The legislative proposal we are dealing with is about VAT rules for copyright licences. These are rules that need to be amended as a result of a ruling by the European Court of Justice, otherwise Denmark will not comply with EU law. I normally regard the Conservative People's Party as a party that stands by both political agreements and respects EU law. The same is true in the case of the Left. But as I understand it now, both parties are going to vote against this bill. In short, and boiled right to the bone, this means that the parties stand in the way of the government being able to comply with EU law. I do not think that is worthy of the parties responsible for government, and I think that is actually worrying. One must ask oneself whether one could vote against oneself if one was in my place in the office of government or whether one can afford to take this view alone because one does not bear the responsibility of government at this time. At the same time, the bill translates part of the new agreement on criminal justice, of which Conservatives and Danish People's Party are part, but which both parties now intend to vote against. So in addition to the fact that a majority in this Parliament does not feel obliged to comply with EU law, several parties also run from an agreement. The draft law has been dealt with in a very thorough manner in committee, which has concentrated mainly on the part concerning the proposal to amend the VAT rules applicable to copyrighted works by artists. I would like to mention that an inter-ministerial working group in a statement has concluded that the draft law meets the requirements for minimum implementation of EU law in Danish law, that there has been a hearing in which representatives of the arts industry could present their views, that 92 questions have been asked and answered, that there have been two consultations, that there have been Section 20 questions which I have answered orally. In addition, the Tax Committee further wished to print out the professional judgement of the Office by having an external advisor assess whether the proposal is necessary. The Ministry of Taxation has, of course, assessed all the comments made, including the opinion of a private law firm, which the Conservatives and the Danish People's Party now attach more importance to than the official legal assessment of the civil servants' lawyers. However, the official assessment remains, for example, that: In future, distributors of licences for artists' copyrights will have to pay VAT. It is the Ministry of Taxation's official work which is responsible for advising the Minister and the Government in this area and therefore also obliged that Danish VAT legislation complies with EU law. Thus, the Ministry of Taxation has the right of interpretation and the duty, and it cannot be outsourced or transferred to a law firm, audit firm or anyone else. There will always be experts, stakeholders, lawyers and others who disagree with the interpretations made by the ministries, but the fundamental principle is that as politicians we trust the assessments we receive from our ministries, and it has always been at the heart that the parties consisting of the Social Democracy, the SF, the Radical Left, the Left and the Conservatives tend to pursue the principle that we naturally respect Denmark's compliance with EU law. Why the Conservatives and the Left are now running away from that principle, the parties themselves must answer for this, but it is a position that usually thrives among more EU-sceptic parties, and it is at least a break and a slip in our attitude to EU law, which is very worrying. It has always been a fundamental principle that we, as politicians, listen to the lawyers of the central administration when we legislate. As a minister, I am obliged to ensure that we comply with legislation in the field of the Ministry of Taxation, including EU law. I cannot and will not ignore the professional judgement of my official work and deliberately violate EU law. The challenge or the bill, if you like, doesn't go away. The case has arisen as part of the ordinary day-to-day work of the official body in following developments in EU law and ensuring that Danish legislation is consistent with it, whether convenient or inconvenient, whichever government is in power both now and certainly in the future. I would therefore call on everyone in this Parliament to show responsibility so that the proposal can be adopted in this session. If this does not happen, I can already give an indication that it will be retabled in the next session in order to comply with the government's obligation to ensure compliance with EU law, including in this area. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607141850	Thank you, Minister. There are brief comments, and first of all it is Mrs Mette Abildgaard, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607141856	I would just like to know, basically, whether the Minister and the Minister's party have supported the fact that one of the highest-ranking law firms was asked to make an assessment of whether the Ministry's interpretation was correct.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607141911	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607141912	I am well aware that, in the light of the wishes of a large minority wishing to carry out an external assessment, the Committee on Taxation has supported such an external assessment. I think it is quite fair parliamentary control over the government that, if you disagree with the assessments that come from the office, you want to print them. So there has of course been an external assessment by an external private law firm, and this has of course led me to ask my ministry to print the most, if you still believe that the initial assessment is valid. And that is the result that has emerged.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607141943	Mrs. Mette Abildgaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607141944	Now that the minister's party has backed up the request for an external make this assessment and I assume that an amount has also been paid to the external party to do so, you do so with the intention of following the assessment that is coming, or at least take very careful note of it. Now the Minister sounds as if it is completely on the moon that some outsiders are asked to make this assessment. And this one external player is just one of many who have come up with the same assessment, namely that it is not necessary to introduce what the Social Democratic Party is doing here. So why has it been asked externally to assess this if you do not want to listen to them anyway?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142020	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142021	I do not think it is on the moon; I think it is quite fair parliamentary control that some people are asked to print, if the assessment that comes from the official work is held. What remains, of course, is that as a minister I am obliged, and I think the rapporteur is aware of this, to follow the advice and guidance that is coming and the duty of interpretation that lies in the official work. What is new here is if the Folketing says: Well, it doesn't mean so much what the official work achieves; it is more important what the Folketing, through external assessment, achieves. That, of course, changes the playing board, in relation to complying with the obligation that I also have as Minister, to ensure that Danish law is in line with EU law.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142055	Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142058	The minister makes it sound like it's the kind of random lawyer that the Tax Committee hired. It is not; it is a lawyer with a great deal of insight into EU law who has worked in the EU system and who, just for the sake of completeness, was in the Parliament's Enterprise Committee in connection with the bill on regulation of tech giants and criticised the proposal for not complying with EU law. Wednesday night at 1:00 a.m. 23.05 before the day of Christ's ascension, the Minister of Industry sent to the Business Committee that the bill on tech giants had to be drawn, unfortunately, as it was not in accordance with EU law. So I just want to say that the government has leaned on the same expert in connection with another bill. So I am surprised that the Minister is giving such a gangbull that the Danish Parliament's Tax Committee hires an external expert to print it. And I just want to know if there is a letter of formal notice from the European Union on this matter.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142201	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142203	I think I have now said twice that I think it is a perfectly reasonable parliamentary tool to ask someone to print out the assessment that is coming. How to translate it into being against or bringing a bandbull, I don't quite understand. Well, that doesn't change the fact that if it was Mr. Cole... Torsten Schack Pedersen, who was in my place, would, of course, break the obligation that you have as Minister to ensure that that right is in accordance with EU law. Because I cannot opt out of the assessment that comes from the office and say that then I choose an assessment that comes from an outside party. After all, the evaluation carried out by the Danish Parliament has led me to ask the Ministry of Taxation and also the Ministry of Justice to print whether the initial assessment is valid. That is what has been achieved. If a different result has been achieved in a different parliamentary control in the context of a legislative proposal on tech giants, then that is fine, but in this context there is no doubt that we need to implement this if we are to comply with EU law. So what remains is that there is a majority in the Folketing now saying: it may well be that this assessment from the office is the one that should make us respect EU law, but we will not vote in favour of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142307	Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142310	However, it was exactly the same discussion we had in connection with the legislative proposal on regulation of tech giants. The government had no doubt whatsoever that there were no problems with EU law, but that view was then changed. I should just like to ask whether there is a letter of formal notice from the European Union that Denmark is not complying with the rules.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142327	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142329	Well, now we're talking about two different laws. And in the last question, I assume that that is what you mean: why do I not wait and see if there is a letter of formal notice? It is not within the framework of the way I have to conduct administration in relation to the law. I cannot say that there is a clear assessment from the office, and here there is one external party who thinks otherwise, and that then leads me to wait and see. Then I do not comply with the commitments I have as Minister, and then I will believe that my life as Minister at the Danish Parliament's mercy will be extremely short.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142401	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. I need to know if there are any more people who want to speak. As this is not the case, the debate is closed and we shall proceed to the vote.

ParlaMint-DK_20220607142730	Amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607142740	Thank you. After all, this is a very good legislative proposal, which relates to activating the funds in the new construction fund so that more general housing can be built. There is then an agreement on this, which will be implemented mainly by this bill. The committee's main concern has been whether we could find a solution in relation to some of the general construction projects that have been put out to tender and where too high building prices have been set. This is something that Enhedslisten has actually been working on since we negotiated Finance Act last autumn. Now there is a solution which will allow the maximum amount to be raised. I need to point out that the amendment that is before us gives a fairly broad authority for the Minister to be able to find a source of funding which may be in relation to both the municipal council, the Landsbygningsfonden, general housing organisations, the state or residents. But if we look at the specific problem of trying to find a solution for 1 400 public housing which has been offered, we have to say that it is not as broad a financing as has been agreed. There it is only a financing where it comes from the Landsbygningsfonden, the municipalities or a mix. I think it is essential to draw attention to the fact that there is a conflict here in which we have received letters from both BL, Københavns Kommune and KL, pointing out that it is not good if we end up with funding where the municipalities must support and contribute more to general construction than is laid down in the basic capital. If the government would like to have problems with KL and with the residents of the general sector, approx. One million residents, and of course it can throw itself into that conflict. Do you want it relatively shortly before a parliamentary election? I think that would be extremely stupid. So I would like to appeal to the end of the day to find a solution where it is the Landsbygningsfond, which fully finances this overrun of the maximum amount. If it ends up with an extra bill for the municipalities, it will mean that fewer general housing will be built, and that is not what we need. I sense that we are there where more and more people are in favour of us having a mixed town and that we need mixed residential areas. We therefore need to ensure that general housing is built. It has to be said that this amendment allows this to happen in a number of residential areas. It is therefore not something that concerns only Copenhagen and Aarhus. This is something that is a national problem, that is to say, that we currently have high building prices which make it difficult to build general housing. It is therefore also good that a working group is set up, and it is important that that working group brings together KL and BL in the best possible way, so that we come up with good, concrete solutions. However, just in the current situation with the 1 400 homes, it is important that it lands where it becomes the Landsbygningsfonden, which finances the extra expenditure. If the government chooses another solution, it would certainly be a bad start for the government in a parliamentary election campaign. I'm just saying that, and it's not the new Minister for Housing who's the problem here. I think it is the Minister for Finance who is the problem in this matter. But there is someone in this room who has a good dialogue with him, so I hope that we will end up with a solution where we will ensure that much more general housing is built. So there are good amendments and there is also an expiry date. Today, it is the amendments that we are voting on, and I hope that we will make progress on this matter.

ParlaMint-DK_20220607150122	Thank you, Madam President. The draft law we are discussing today is, after all, about the forced distribution of young people on the basis of their parents' income. Here earlier today we have seen a large number of young people standing down at the Palace Square demonstrating against this bill and for the citizens' proposal we will be dealing with later. They will be recognised as the young people they are, for the dreams they have for life and for the desires they have for which educational institution they should go to. They will not be pawns in an algorithm where they are forcibly allocated on the basis of what their parents earn, distributed in the categories a little, in between and too much. But in addition to the forced distribution model, which deals with the large cities, this bill also includes the whole part of our high schools in rural areas. It is a part on which there has been broad agreement in the Folketing for a very long time • how we can ensure that we have a Denmark in education balance and how we can ensure that the small institutions can also exist in the future at a time of very dramatically decreasing pupil numbers. This is part of the draft law, which has, of course, been subject to a great deal of debate, consultation and debate, both in committee and also with the actors in this area. It is part of the bill which is based on good ideas, I would say, from a wide range of parliamentary parties, because there has just been a broad consensus that we all have an obligation to secure the smaller institutions in the outermost regions. We have therefore also asked from the Left, the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance, supported by the New Citizens and the Conservative People's Party, to have this bill divided into two separate votes, two parts, so that we can vote on the part about a forced distribution model in urban areas on the basis of parental income for ourselves and, at the same time, we can also show that there is still a broad majority in this Parliament which supports the model that has been agreed and which is so much about ensuring that there is stability around our smaller institutions around the country. That part is also about guaranteeing the free choice of young people, because if we do not ensure that there are institutions around the country, there are also no institutions to choose for too many young people, and that is why this bill is about ensuring free choice in rural areas, but it is also about taking the parental income part out of the urban divide model, if it was up to the Left, so that we can also ensure free choice for young people in urban areas. We hope that the Radical Left, the SF, the Social Democrats, the Enhedslist and the others who have announced in the report that the bill will not be split up have been given better thought over the weekend. After all, we have been able to hear that the Prime Minister has said that broad cooperation is good and that we want to reach out, but yet we can see that there is a majority of the Social Democratic Government and the Red Parties blocking the vote on this two-part bill blocking what has been a broad wish in the Folketing over a long period of time, namely that we send a strong signal to the small institutions in the outermost regions that we are all behind them, we cannot be allowed to vote separately on. I think that is a pity, and I really think that shows that we would rather make spin than ensure that there is stability around the institutions in rural areas. Yes, we disagree about the urban model and the forced distribution based on parental income that a majority wants, but no one has said that we disagree with the second part, and that is why I think it is a pity that we see that we are blocking the fact that we can vote in two rounds. On the Left side, however, we also know that it is not enough to create a model for the distribution of pupils if we are to secure the small institutions in the outermost regions; then we must also ensure that there is an economy for them to have quality and that they can maintain offers in several parts of the country so that we get more education close to young people. That is why we have also said from the very beginning of the negotiations that we thought that taximeter negotiations and student distribution negotiations should be negotiated in one way, so that we could just secure the economy for the small institutions around the country. We also have a motion for a resolution on the same subject, and we also, when we sat in government, the VLAK government together with the Danish People's Party, placed a reservation authorisation on the Finance Act so that a taximeter reform could be carried out, which among other things. could significantly increase the basic subsidy for the smaller institutions, so that they had an economic basis that is greater than what we know today. Instead, you choose to spend nearly 200 million. kr. to create a new IT system built on algorithms for the forced distribution part instead of spending the money in the bill to secure the smaller institutions. This is a wrong priority, and we in the Left believe that we should also do away with it, but we can hear that the Socialists and the Red majority do not want it. That is a pity, but what one can hope today is that there is a willingness to divide the legislative proposal into two so that we can vote on the two parts separately. So I hope we can get that out of today's debate. I believe that young people, both those in rural areas and those in cities, would appreciate that we do not confuse things, but that we can ensure both a proper solution for free elections around the country and a proper solution for free elections in cities, where we in the Left certainly do not support the forced distribution proposed in the bill. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150722	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are a few brief comments to be made to the rapporteur, and that is first, Mr President. Jens Joel, the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150728	Thank you. It is quite obvious when you talk to the sector, with teachers, with schools, with pupils, that the Fatamorgana, which the Left talks so much about, namely the completely free choice, does not exist today. But what really makes me speak is to hear whether the rapporteur of the Left can confirm that what the Left calls forced distribution, namely that not everyone necessarily gets their first priority, is okay. If you live in the smaller towns, you may be forced into it, but if you live in the big cities, you cannot. What difference does it make in human perception that the Left calls one a forced division and the other a necessary thing to ensure high schools?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150811	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150813	Forced distribution on the basis of parental income is the Left against that we are in the cities, and we are in the countryside. But if you look at this bill, it's not a matter of parental income in the rural areas, because that's what we got negotiated out. So where the dividing line is going is, of course, around the young people in the cities, i.e. whether or not they should be subject to forced distribution on the basis of parental income. We say no to this, but it is not part of the rural area, and the rural area has always been widely supported by the Folketing. But we cannot be allowed to vote separately on it, because it blocks the Socialists, together with the Radical Left, together with the SF, together with the Enhedslisten and with some of the non-attached Members. We have just dealt with two legislative proposals today, where we have split up the bill there apparently there were no problems. So it is not a question of will; it is a question of really wanting and blocking a vote on the free choice of young people in cities and the free choice of young people in rural areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150905	Sir. Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150907	No, it is about nine out of ten young people actually meeting their priorities. We are based on young people's priorities, but we need the distribution of pupils today, and that is what we want in the future. It was, moreover, when Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby herself was Minister for Education that Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby called for new rules on the allocation of pupils. There are then some student distribution rules that are perceived as coercion, and some that do not. And there I do not understand why those in the smaller towns should be placed at a disadvantage, in the view of the Left, of the free choice than those in the large cities, where there is quite a coincidence between parents' income and their place of residence in parentheses.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150942	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607150944	Well, I understand that the Socialist rapporteur is trying to avoid doing all sorts of spins, because it is a really bad thing that we want to divide young people according to their parents' income and not on the basis of their free choice of education. That is why the Left does not support the part of the agreement that is included in the draft law today. However, the distribution of parental income is only included in the bill's part of the big cities. It is not part of the country, because this was negotiated in the negotiations that are under way, and so we think it would be appropriate for us to be allowed to vote on this draft law in two parts, so that we can vote on free elections in both the outermost regions and in urban areas, where we look differently at how young people should be distributed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151026	The next brief remark is to Mr. Kasper Sand Kjær, Social Democracy. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151030	Now the confusion is total. In other words, if I understand the rapporteur correctly, the distribution of pupils in peripheral areas is freedom, and the distribution of pupils in urban areas is coercive. Can the rapporteur himself not hear that this is not connected? Perhaps student distribution is just common sense in both rural and urban areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151050	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151052	I think it is because the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has a really bad case that we are trying to avoid talking and thus mix up apples and pears, because that is what the Socialists are doing. After all, there is no parental income distribution over the rural areas in the draft law we are discussing; it is only laid down over urban areas. And just as we want free choice for the students in the big cities, we also want free choice for the rest of the country. This requires that we also maintain institutions; that we ensure that there are high schools to choose from. That's why this discussion is two completely different things. And I actually saw that the Socialists agreed on this when we negotiated it, that is to say that there was one model for urban areas and one model for the rest of the country, because these are two completely different solutions. So we are in favour of free elections for young people all over the country. That is also why we want this bill to be split up so that we can ensure that there are institutions from which young people can choose freely in rural areas and that we do away with the forced distribution model of parental income that the Socialists and a majority have proposed, which must be for urban areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151154	Sir. Kasper Sand Kjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151156	Yes, perhaps the mechanisms are different, but the logic is the same, namely that if we just give it completely free and do not have student-sharing mechanisms, we end up with high schools in the outermost regions closing down and that in the cities we will see the breakdown of our secondary schools. After all, that is what the distribution of pupils is intended to prevent. After all, it aims to maintain both secondary schools in the outermost regions and to have mixed secondary schools in urban areas, so that there is real freedom of choice for pupils. This is, of course, what the student distribution ensures, namely that there is a really free choice to go to a high school where you meet others who do not look like you and where you can go to your local high school in the outermost regions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151233	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151235	I think the Socialist rapporteur should read the draft law that has been tabled on the model of the Socialist Government, because the compulsory distribution of parental income only applies in the distribution zones and therefore in the large cities as it stands; it does not apply in the rest of the country. In the rest of the country we have a system that is more or less similar to the system we have today, that is, a system that has been broadly politically supportive of. That is also why we are a number of parties who have asked for the bill to be split up so that we can vote on what everyone agrees on: how to ensure free choice and preserve the small institutions, while at the same time being able to disagree on the part that is about forced distribution on the basis of parental income that the Socialists want to expose young people to in the cities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151317	The next brief remark is from Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151321	Thank you for that and thank the rapporteur for taking the floor. It has been a while since I have seen the rapporteur in this context, but we did see him during the negotiations on this agreement. I normally know the rapporteur as a very objective and proper politician, and therefore I am a little surprised that we need to talk about forced distribution when it comes to cities, whereas it is just distribution and free choice when it comes to rural areas. But what I wanted to ask is: since when has the Left categorically rejected the distribution model that is for cities? I read a quote here: we do not reject any initiatives in advance, because there is a need to ensure that we get a better distribution so that we do not get ghetto schools. That is what the rapporteur said in 2019. So since when has the Left rejected this model, and what model does the Left want instead?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151408	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151409	We are not part of an agreement, and we are not because we do not believe that forced distribution on the basis of parental income is the right basis. If we had meant it, we could have agreed to a deal. As you know, we did not do this a year ago, because we believe that we never landed in relation to the urban model. On the other hand, we agreed on the part relating to the land model. That is also why it may be surprising, because I also know the radical rapporteur as usual as being factually correct that today the Radical Left will be voting against and blocking a legislative proposal in two parts, so that a broad majority of Parliament's parties can vote on the part that concerns the rural gymnasiums, ensure stability around them, send a clear signal that we are all on the goal of providing education throughout the country. And then we can discuss the part about forced distribution on the basis of parental income in the cities. So I also hope that the radical rapporteur will come up here so that we can get an answer as to why the Radical Left is blocking the bill from being split into two.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151506	Anne Sophie Callesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151508	I don't really think I got an answer. I can of course welcome the fact that the Left is now burning hot to save the outskirts of the gymnasium, and I certainly recognise that too, and we must also have found a model for that in relation to the taximeter. But it's new to me that you suddenly want to take this responsibility. But my question was really: since when has the model that is in relation to cities been categorically rejected? What other criteria are to be applied? And then it's just to understand, because I agree that when we save high schools on the outskirts, we make sure that there is a free choice in the future too... why it's different than when we save high schools from closing in the West? Are not Western youths worth as much as young people outside the cities? Shouldn't they also have a local high school in the future?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151549	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151550	It is not new that the Left does not support a forced distribution model based on parental income. That's why we're not part of a deal. I think that has actually been clear over the last year. I believe that the agreement was reached, if I do not remember quite wrongly, on 6 June, i.e. 1 year and 1 day ago, so that it should be new to the radical rapporteur, I do not understand. On the other hand, there is nothing new about the fact that the Left put a great deal of energy into the negotiations, both when we were in government and allocating permanent reservation appropriations to secure a new taximeter system and doing a taximeter review and an institutional review because we wanted some solutions. But this is the wrong solution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151626	Then it is Mrs Astrid Carøe, Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151639	Thank you. I simply cannot understand how the rapporteur can say that the distribution of distance outside the large cities is free choice for pupils, and the distribution of parental income in the large cities and then on the basis of distance is forced distribution and one of the worst things that has ever happened. What's the difference? What is outside the big cities is not free choice. It's also a distribution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151705	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151706	I think it is enormously out of the question to distribute young people, not on the basis of their free choice of education, but on the basis of the economy of their parents. That is also why we are not part of the agreement by the Left. But the SF's rapporteur makes the same mistake as the Socialists: apples and pears are mixed. The debate on the outermost regions is not just about distribution; it is about ensuring that we have some institutions at all. In some of the areas where the number of pupils falls by both 20 and 30 per cent, there is a need to ensure that there is at all a guarantee not only of this legislation, it is also ensured by the willingness to make a taximeter reform that actually provides them with a higher basic subsidy, and to ensure that they have some financial framework conditions. There was no will to do so, even in those negotiations. We on the Left have said this from the outset is really a pity, because it also takes the economy to secure the small institutions. However, the bill that we are asking for to split up today does not make sense to me that the SF is blocking that we can split up so that we can show that we have agreement on the part that is about saving the smaller institutions, but, of course, as is clear from the debate, there is disagreement as to whether young people should be forcedly allocated on the basis of their parents' income.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151815	Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151817	As far as the meter is concerned, we are in complete agreement with that, and we are not at all in the end yet and still have to have the negotiations that we have been shouting for a long time. However, I disagree with the rapporteur when he says that it is mixing apples and pears, because what it is all about is ensuring stability, whether it is outside the big cities or inside the big cities. It's about ensuring stability. And I don't understand why you want to keep your hand under high schools outside the big cities, but not high schools that the young people of the West are going to go to. That's what we're doing with this deal. However, for the last time, can the rapporteur just confirm that it says that if one distributes on the basis of distance and on the basis of where one lives, there is obviously free choice, but if one distributes on the basis of parental income, is it forced distribution? Really?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151858	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151900	On the Left side, we do not support forced distribution on the basis of parental income. We want to support the free choice of young people. We do that in urban areas, we do that in rural areas. When there are two different things we are talking about today, it is because there are very many places where there is a real risk that the local high school simply has to close because there are not enough young people. That is why it is precisely a question of guaranteeing their free choice and ensuring that there is a model that holds hands under those institutions. That is also why I hope that the SF will not block the fact that we can split up the bill so that we can have a vote in which the parties of the Folketing can vote on the two parts separately.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151935	The next brief remark is to Mrs Katrine Robsøe, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607151944	Thank you. In fact, I would like to give the rapporteur a chance to respond effectively to what my colleague Mrs Sophie Callesen asked, namely: what urban model does the Left actually want to find when we now recognise the challenge that exists in some of the major cities? Which model does the Left want to use?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152000	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152002	We want a model in which young people are not forcibly allocated on the basis of their parents' income, where hundreds of millions are not spent on creating an algorithm-based system that does not provide real insight into. We want a model where you also look at the taximeter system, and we actually said so before these negotiations started... we don't believe that you can do this in isolation from the taximeter negotiations. For this discussion is also about money; it is, both when we look at the institutions in the outermost regions that need a higher basic subsidy in order to exist at all, one also when we look at some of the institutions in urban areas that are challenged. Because if you are going to make a turn for some of the institutions that have been rejected for various reasons, there must also be an economy to make that turn. Unfortunately, there has been no willingness to find this either on the part of the Radical Left or on the part of the Socialist Government.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152051	Mrs. Katrine Robsøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152053	I do not quite know whether I think we have received an answer as to which model the Left would then like to actually correct those problems. I hear a lot about what the Left does not want to do, so I would really like to follow up on what Mrs Carøe asked, namely: is it understood correctly that the Left would like to give a forced advantage when it comes to school?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152124	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152126	We do not want to be forced to benefit on the basis of parental income. We do not want this either in urban areas or in rural areas. And that's what this discussion is about. It is not new that there is a distance criterion or a time criterion. It's not new. It's always been in the models that have been. What is new is that the Radical Left, together with the Social Democracy, the SF, the Enhedslisten and a number of other parties, are in favour of creating a model of forced distribution based on parental income. That is the new one, and we are against it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152154	The next brief remark is to Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152159	What will the Left distribute to the students in the cities?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152202	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152205	Yes, but that is not the discussion we have here in Parliament. We have taken part in those negotiations and we have also come up with a number of different models for what we could look at, and there has been no desire for that. Instead, we have insisted that a compulsory distribution should be made on the basis of parental income, and that is why the Left is not part of the agreement that has been made. Today, when we ask for this bill to be split up, and that is what today's debate is about, we can say that it is because the forced distribution model that lies in cities on the basis of parental income does not lie in rural areas. There it was negotiated, and we therefore think it appropriate that the Radical Left too should not block the fact that the Folketing can vote on this bill in two parts, so that the broad majority of the parties in the Folketing, who have always been responsible for ensuring that a model which also saved the smaller institutions, can be allowed to vote in favour of this part without voting in favour of the idea that parental income should be the one on which the pupils must be forced to benefit.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152257	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152259	Yeah, I actually have that wish. I would therefore like us to be able to do this together and would therefore just ask again: what kind of model does the Left want to distribute to the students in the cities? Are those after grades? Or what is it that the Left wants to use to distribute the students?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152313	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152315	But that discussion could have been taken if one had had the will to do so. We don't really see that there has been. I mean, it's a desire to put down a forced distribution model based on parental income. That is what is included in the legislative proposal, and that is what we are going to vote on today and on Thursday. These aren't any other models. So that is why we are clearly saying that part we are going to roll back. It doesn't change the fact that there are some places where there are challenges about a polarisation in relation to ethnicity and other things. We said that when we were in government, and we said that afterwards, but this is the wrong model, and we will roll it back if we have a majority after the next election. We think young people deserve that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152353	The next brief remark is to Mr. Rasmus Stoklund, the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152358	I would like to follow up where Mrs Lotte Rod left off, because I am a little surprised that it is now said that that discussion could have been relevant, but that there has not been an opportunity to take it. After all, there have been a long period of time in which you have had the opportunity to make some offers yourself, and let me quote from an answer that Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby gave to the Committee on Children and Education in September 2016: "We must prevent ghetto education, and this requires, among other things, that the distribution committees be locally committed to ensuring a different distribution than today, including getting the tools for it. ▪ What are these tools? And what is it that keeps using the obsessive rhetoric when it is now clear to everyone that there are already nine out of ten today who come to the high school they want, and when in the future there will also be nine out of ten who do so? That is why there is no more or less coercion in what has been put forward here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152444	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152446	There is so much more coercion in the legislative proposal that is to be voted on today. It is a model of forced distribution in large cities, where young people will in future be widely distributed on the basis of their parents' income and not on the basis of their educational choices. It is out of the question, and it is a breach of the traditions we have in the field of education. This is the whole discussion we have, and we did not need to have this discussion if the Socialists had taken a new view over the weekend. But that is because the Socialists, together with the Red parties, insist that there should be a compulsory distribution on the basis of parental income. What tools did we provide in 2016? I think the questioner knows that. We first made some temporary options for capacity regulation. They will be made permanent in the bill that we are also discussing. We made it possible to use the KUO model in, among other things. Aarhus, and there were various other tools, which in some respects have heaved things in a more stable direction. Therefore, this is also a discussion in which we have said from the outset that this cannot be resolved without being willing to look at a taximeter debate • a taximeter debate that has been pickled and parked in the three years of the Social Democracy having been sitting with government power.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152553	Sir. Rasmus Stoklund for another short remark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152555	There I must remind Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby that what happened in 2016, which was the most important thing, was that a new minister came and that that minister postponed the negotiations, and then things did not really happen anymore. Now we have tried to take up the task and try to solve it. I still do not think that we are getting an answer as to why, with the rhetoric that is being used and with some of the answers given today to some of the questions put by my colleagues, we would like to vote in favour of an agreement which uses compulsory distribution for young people living in rural areas, while it is absolutely inconceivable that we can vote in favour of an agreement that regulates in the same way what a student can do if he is a young person living in an urban area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152631	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152633	Well, we on the Left do not support forced distribution on the basis of parental income. This is true in the cities, and it is true in the countryside. However, the draft law we are discussing today does not include it as a criterion in rural areas. We were able to negotiate that out. But it is part of the cities, because the Socialists, together with a majority of the parties, have insisted on it. It seems to us to be out of the question, and we think it is the wrong way. That is why we want a free choice for young people in the field of education, including in urban areas. That is why we hope that we can have a vote on the two parts individually, because there is a huge difference between the two models we are discussing today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152707	The next brief remark is to Mr. Karsten Filsø, Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152712	Thank you. Let me give you an example. When I'm not here, I'm a municipal politician in Holstebro, and I'm a board member at Holstebro High School. We have students from all over our municipality. From now on, students from the west will have to go to Lemvig Gymnasium, an excellent high school, but there you are needy in relation to students. You will be missing approx. 30% The students who are in the area west of where I live will experience coercion. They will not be able to get to Holstebro, as they have previously been able to. Up north in Vinderup you are going to Struer, and there you will be missing about 20 per cent. So the thing with compulsion, I find it hard to grade-bend. At least there are some students who are going to experience that they are being forced somewhere.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152808	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152810	Thank you. Lemvig High School is an excellent high school. I myself have had the pleasure of going there as a young person, and so I am well aware of that geography. But what we are talking about here is nothing new. There's nothing new in it. The new feature of the legislative proposal in this area, however, is that we ensure a minimum capacity of three tracks; something on which we broadly agree. That is also why we want to divide this bill into two so that we can ensure exactly what we agree on, namely that we must also preserve the small institutions around the country, in relation to the need to have free elections. For there is no free choice for the young people in Thyborøn or Harboøre if Lemvig Gymnasium closes and there is no longer a local high school. Then there is not the option of choosing an institution close by. That is why the model we are talking about in relation to rural areas is quite different from the forced distribution in the cities that the Social Democrats, the SF, the Radical Left, the Enhedslisten and some of the non-attached Members want to make on the basis of the income of young people's parents. It is not on the basis of free choice and the wishes of young people, but on the basis of the income of many of their parents, and we do not support that part. But we support the second part, and we hope that we will be able to vote in favour of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152920	Thank you. The second brief remark to Mr Beazley. Karsten Filsø.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152922	Thank you. I think Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby is gradulating the free choice and coercion. There is no doubt that young people are experiencing coercion. You can get an excellent high school education in Lemvig, and you can also get it in Struer and in Holstebro, but if you can't choose where you go, it's forced.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152944	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607152946	We want freedom of choice for young people throughout the country. That is also why, in the negotiations, we, all parties in agreement, have looked at it in relation to the need for different models. Because, in relation to the outermost regions, the discussion is not whether it is one or the other, but whether there is an institution at all. That is why the rural part of this bill is more concerned with ensuring that there are institutions from which young people can choose, i.e. that young people have a free choice at all to be able to choose a local institution. What has been proposed with regard to cities is a compulsory distribution of parental income.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153020	The next brief remark is to Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153024	Thank you to the rapporteur. Now we are talking a lot about a model and a forced distribution based on parental income, which we are strongly opposed to. But you can also hear that what is really important is the well-being of young people, and now we have received many worrying e-mails from many institutions and citizens that they are seriously concerned about the well-being of young people. Can the rapporteur confirm that it is true that you cannot change high school if you do not thrive on the high school you go to and if the reason is that it is a high school you have been forced to go to?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153100	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153102	It is quite true, as the Conservative rapporteur says, that there is a massive concern both on the part of young people and on the part of parents about the fact that the forced distribution which is now being proposed will also result in a deep distrust, and that is also why we have tabled an amendment which takes that part of the proposal out. However, what we are going to vote on in the first place is whether or not we can divide up the legislative proposal, and so I agree with the rapporteur on the second part.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153129	Mrs. Katarina Ammitzbøll.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153130	The second part was that SF here says that we do not take responsibility for the high schools in the Western Region, but precisely the Western Forest Gymnasium and Taastrup, which I have visited, do not want to be part of this, as I understand it, and they have actually made some strong high schools, especially Western Forest, and managed things themselves. Have we looked at these possibilities enough, as it stands now? Now I have not been the rapporteur in this area lately, and it may be that the rapporteur can help clarify this from the platform. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153158	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153200	We in the Left, like the Conservative People's Party and also the other blue parties, want us not to create a model of forced distribution based on parental income, but to preserve the free choice of young people, and fortunately a number of the institutions also support this. And there are also a number of particularly high-level vocational education institutions in which pupils' organisations support it, and they are very concerned, and there is also a citizens' proposal that we will have to deal with later today, which is so supportive of it. That is why I also hope that today we can both send out a signal that we are some who want free elections, but that we can also divide up the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153234	The next brief remark is to Mrs Maria Gudme, the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153241	Thank you. I would just like to follow up on what the rapporteur has just said, namely that it is not possible to change if you experience displeasure where you go. Will the rapporteur say once and for all whether this is true? As I know, it is not true that there is no possibility of changing if you experience displeasure.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153304	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153305	After all, it is a discussion about whether or not the President should approve it, and that is part of the discussion that lies in the amendments. But that simply underlines the whole point, i.e. whether you have respect for young people. Do you believe that young people can choose for themselves? Do we believe that free secondary school elections are important also in creating educated and self-confidence young people? Or do we believe that we should have a forced distribution model based on parents' income? Well, we believe in free choice and in the young people themselves and want to show them confidence, and we think this model is wrong.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153338	Mrs. Maria Gudme.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153339	Personally, I must say that I firmly believe that it is precisely respect for young people to be concerned that everyone has the opportunity to go to the high school they want, regardless of their social background. Because that is exactly what the model can help to ensure that you have the opportunity, even in the big cities, and that you are not pressured to go to another high school than you want. But right here the discussion about distrust and this with the model is mixed together, and I hear that it is confirmed that it is not true that one cannot change high school if one is exposed to distrust.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153425	Thank you. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153426	It will have to be approved by the principal, as was the answer, and if you read the discussions that have been held in connection with the bill, then that is one of the issues under discussion. But no, I do not think it is respect for young people to make a forced distribution based on their parents' income, and that is precisely the problem with this bill, so that young people cannot be sure of getting the high school they are passionate about. They cannot be sure that they can break out of their social background precisely because it will be their parents' income that binds them to whether they can or they cannot. Therefore, there are too many coincidences in this and it basically breaks with the free choice of the students, and therefore we are against.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153502	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. Do more people want to speak? As this is not the case, the debate is closed and we shall proceed to the vote.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153513	Amendment No 1 shall be put to the vote. 1, by a minority (V, DF and LA), joined by a minority (KF and NB), that the bill is divided into two legislative proposals and can be voted on. The vote shall be closed. For voting 41 (V, KF, DF, NB, LA, Bent Bøgsted (UFG) and Karina Adsbøl (UFG)), against voting 55 (S, SF, RV, EL, FG and ALT), abstentions 0. The division of the bill has been rejected. That is why we are voting against the motion for a resolution. 2-31 to the split bill lapsed. Amendments to the undivided legislative proposal shall then be put to the vote. PRESIDENT. - The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: 32-45, joined by a majority (S, SF, RV, EL, DF, NB, LA and Marie Krarup (UFG))? They are adopted. It has been proposed that the bill be referred back to committee and, if no one objects, I consider it adopted. It's agreed. Then there are no more votes, and before we move on to the next item, those Members who do not wish to take part in the debate on the next item will be able to leave the Chamber calmly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153735	The debate is open. The first to speak is the Minister for Children and Education.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607153750	Thank you. You gotta hear a lot of bullshit before your ears fall off. I was sorry for not being able to make brief comments in the previous debate for a moment, but, as you know, you cannot do so as a minister. I should just like to point out, if anyone has been listening to the debate, that one can of course change upper secondary school if it is the case that one is disillusioned. That is actually part of the agreement, and I think it might be appropriate for us to confine ourselves to discussing the issues on which we actually disagree, rather than discussing the myths of what might and, if so, even imagined to be in an agreement. Then I am very excited about what kind of proposals the Left really should have made. I am not allowed to refer from the negotiating rooms, so I can just ask the question openly and then you can answer it. Because I understand from the rapporteur that all sorts of exciting model proposals have apparently been made in the course of the negotiations on how to solve this problem. It would be interesting for the public to know what it was for some, because if the Left were now to become those who have the power of government after an election, then it is relevant for people to know what they intend to do. Well, that was then for the previous discussion. Now we have a citizens' proposal for free secondary school elections for everyone, and this is a resolution that we are dealing with here in the Danish Parliament. The proposers want the Folketing not to adopt L 157 on the distribution of pupils. After all, we have just dealt with L 157, and I really do not think it should be a secret that there have been many objections, and it is also on the basis of them that we have reconsidered how and how we should do it about the distribution of pupils. So if we start with the whole background that we have had to look into something about the distribution of pupils, then we have had a development in the Danish high school sector where we have seen two different, but both incredibly unfortunate developments. One is that up to 2030 we are facing a lot of smaller colleges, especially in the province, in Denmark, being threatened with their existence because there are simply fewer pupils up until 2030. We have had a desire to keep our hands under them, and that is why it is included as one part of the student distribution agreement. The second element is that in the cities we have seen extreme polarisation, that is. a division where we have had echo chambers a la what you see on Facebook: you only hear from those you know and those you look like, while the rest of the world conveniently disappears in an algorithm, and that part you never hear from. For the government and for the Social Democratic Party, it is absolutely crucial that our education system should be both primary school, but also secondary school and the rest of our education system • meet all the aspects of the purpose clause, namely that the school should both teach the pupils something that is preparatory to study, something professional, but also teach the pupils to commit themselves in the society to which they become part. Of course, echo chambers do not benefit, the echo chambers are counterproductive in relation to a desire for us to have cohesion in Denmark. This is particularly true in the big cities, because there are a great many high schools very close, and the young people have had the choice over the last 10 years that they can either go to a high school where everyone looks like them, or can go to a high school where nobody looks like them. So it creates these downward spirals, where the high schools are becoming more and more different and the students divide themselves more and more, because you don't have a desire to go and I can actually understand that going to a high school where no one looks like you. Therefore, for years both rectors, teachers and pupils have been asking for better choices, that is, that the composition of pupils in the high schools was more balanced, so that the choices one could make were better so that one would not choose either one or the other echo chamber in this way, but could actually be allowed to go somewhere where there was an opportunity for one to learn to commit oneself and be challenged at one's own echo chamber, so to speak, because there were also others than the group one belonged to. So that's where all this has started, and we have then, after this has been a problem that has been debated for 10 years, taken up the glove and come up with a model for how to do this. There are extremely many dilemmas in that, I would like to say, and that is why we have spent a great many hours in the negotiating room and also in discussions with various organisations. When it comes to dealing with legislation, it has become clear that one of the things that many saw as insecure was that we had introduced an element that was about drawing lots. That is why we chose to go back into the contract circle and discuss the issue of drawing lots and have chosen to replace it with a distance criterion instead. It also relates to part of the second criticism of the proposal, namely that there was a concern that one should travel very far away, in other words that one could risk having to be busted far away from the local area in which one lived. By replacing the drawing of lots with a distance criterion, i.e. a transport criterion, it happens that fewer pupils will have to travel far away. This applies not only to the old agreement, but also to the old rules. In other words, the new regulation simply requires fewer people to travel far away than is the case today. At the same time, there will be about the same number, or indeed more, that comes at their wish gymnasium than what has been the case with the rules that have applied over the past many years. All in all, we believe that we have found a balance and have also listened to the things that have come from some of them, by the way, behind the citizens' proposal, and thus got what I think was a good agreement done even better. I'm surprised, and I'm sorry, that I didn't manage to reach a broad agreement on this. I think we had a very good course of negotiations, and I actually thought we were close to reaching each other. I don't understand, and it may be, because I'm not schooled out in blue ideology that you can call it Soviet socialism, I think it was, and other things like forced distribution. It was all up to the high nails, ideologically speaking, that the parties to the agreement, and by the way, both rectors and high school teachers and high school students, want to distribute the pupils. In other words, what is supposed to be the Soviet and the compulsion is that there are some who do not talk about their wish gymnasium, their first priority. On the other hand, when we talk about the provinces of Denmark, we want to help some students not to enter their wish college. But in this context it is neither Soviet nor forced nor anything else. That's where you go so far, you actually call it free high school. I still think it is quite wild that the two things can somehow be there at the same time. Either it must be an expression of something that is Soviet-style, or both must be something that is free-choice-like. At least these are two very different ways of describing that situation. I would say that when the concepts are used so differently, I think that, if I am going to make a bid, one might have been caught a little bit in one's own spin for the blue parties. The reality is that it has always been the case in Denmark that the students have been distributed. There are only those places in the high schools which are there, and there are also only those colleges which are in the given year of entry, and therefore pupils are distributed if there are too many applicants for a high school. They've always been. The same also applies to primary schools, where there are school districts. This has been so far back, the eye stretches, which means that it is a completely solid part of the Danish school tradition that pupils are distributed. In other words, what we are dealing with here is that we distribute the pupils, as has always been done, and that there is a small part of the students who do not go to their wish college. So it is today. Fortunately, high school is very good at accepting students who have not been given their first priority. It is a task that it is completely used to, because it happens every year, and therefore the rectors have also been open to it, even if there were to be a total fall there is not, so we are not there. But it's something that high school is used to. It is just to say that it is perhaps merely an expression of the fact that calling something free from high school is to drag it too far in one direction in its characterization, because it is not. Conversely, to call it forced distribution and Soviet states may be to pull it a little in the other direction in the characteristics of it. So maybe we should just move to where we talk about things, as they are, namely that today there is no free choice of high school. There has never been, and there will be no future, but it is the case that in the future system there will be as many people as there are today who come to their wish college and get their first priority. In fact, it seems that there will be a little more, and transport time also falls in the larger cities. This means that there will be more students who experience entering their local high school. Why is that? It is, of course, because if we look at Western high schools, such as Herlev Gymnasium or Hvidovre Gymnasium, which are old distinguished institutions, then they have entered such an evil spiral, where the composition of the pupil has become crooked. Then the young people who live in Herlev or Hvidovre begin not to seek their local high school. Then they go away because they don't have a desire to go into an echo chamber with some young people who don't look like themselves. What then happens with the student distribution is that we get the pupil composition straightened out, for example. Hvidovre and Herlev Gymnasium, which are otherwise slided down there, compared to how many students are going there, and as a regular, at least in the case of one, have been specifically threatened with closure because of the developments that have taken place. Now there will be a balanced composition of pupils, and hopefully that will and of course, I would almost say "mean that some of those who will not go there, if it is an echo chamber for some who are not like themselves, will start to find it attractive again. We'll see that, but it's just to say that where the biggest drop in the number of people who go to their wish gymnasium is some of the places where the high schools are whirlpooling and where I don't think one can think about the young people that they don't want to go there as long as the composition of the pupils is so crooked. At the same time, this means that the journey time is falling, because the moment you get a balanced pupil's composition and it is, for example, Hvidovre or Herlev Gymnasium, a student from Hvidovre or Herlev going on, the student gets less time for their gymnasium compared to today, where they lie and transport themselves all sorts of other places, because they want to avoid becoming part of an echo chamber where no one looks like them. So that's the logic behind the student distribution agreement. What is being proposed with the citizens' proposal is that there should be complete freedom of choice in high school. There has never been such a thing in Denmark, and there are such really crunchy logistical problems, because what do you really do if there are 100 additional students looking for a particular high school? Should it then be obliged to go out and rent rooms and hire teachers, and what do I know, or how do we do that? So I think there are some logistical challenges, but I won't spend too much time on that. Summa summarum is that I think we have gotten mighty good kicks along the way in the creation of this agreement from the various organizations. I also think that those who are behind the citizens' proposal have come up with some very good ideas, both in relation to this element which is about drawing lots, but also in relation to this desire that you should not drive far away from your local area if you do not go to your wish gymnasium. At any rate, this has been input which we have taken note of and amended in the light of the agreement. That is why I would like to thank you for the work that has been done by both pupils and parents in connection with this proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155002	Thank you, Minister. There are many brief comments to be made to the Minister. The first is from Mrs Mette Abildgaard, Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155015	Thank you to the Minister for the speech and also to acknowledge the work that has been put into it by those who have made this citizens' proposal. I know the Minister as a very ideologically founded politician, and I really like that very much. It does not matter that we look at things differently, and I think it is very much I to which the Minister refers in relation to the Soviet situation and concrete communism. I think I've been called the deal a bit of each when we negotiated it at the time. I would like to ask the question of the ideology of principle. It is important for the Minister to prevent the echo chamber and to ensure this mixed assembly. I'm just curious about what other parts of our society that should also apply to. Why is it so important that it's exactly the high schools we're looking at here? Should we have the same in the music school, in the homeowners' association, in higher education? Now I know that the Minister has the area of responsibility right here, but ideologically, in principle, is this the desire to prevent the echo chamber and to be willing to use tools, as is being done here, which justify it, so elsewhere in society?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155116	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155117	There are two areas where we already have it. One area is primary school, where it has existed as long as the concept of school district has existed. There it is exactly what the municipal councils do every year. They set school districts on the basis of a concern and a desire to mix schools as well as possible. And that's what you're drawing school districts from. So in the field of education we have had it so far back in our eyes and where we have had the school pupils who, by the way, are considerably more intrusive than what we are talking about here, because the pupils cannot in this way simply seek free and equal in terms of primary school. So in this way it can be said that it is a much more intrusive model. Somewhere else we have it was introduced by the previous government, in other words Mrs Mette Abildgaard's government, with regard to the parallel social agreement in the area of day-care. So just in my own area there are two examples of this, and in both places it has been done on the basis of a wish that ghetto children's gardens or ghetto schools should not arise, and what we are going to do is to avoid there being ghetto high schools, as is called in a rather ugly word. So it is just to say that yes, it certainly exists in other areas too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155227	Mrs. Mette Abildgaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155229	After all, we do not have a distribution of primary school pupils today based on parents' income to just make it clear first. And yes, it is true that we are willing to address the problems that exist when parallel societies arise that are out of step with Danish society. And that is why we want to do something about those high schools where it is a problem today and make an earmarked effort. We also offered that to the Minister during the negotiations. Does the Minister consider it to be as big a problem that there may be what the Minister called a ghetto high school as there is a high school in Gentofte, where the mixed composition of pupils that the Minister has as its objective is not achieved?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155301	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155303	Yes, in general, I do not like the idea that we should be too fragmented. So it's okay that there's no difference, but I actually think it's a really good idea that we know each other crosswise. Then I would say in relation to the fact that school districts should not benefit on the basis of income: now I do not know whether Mrs Mette Abildgaard has been in a municipal council or maybe even do so, but I have lived at Frederiksberg, and that is where my one child is now going to primary school, and I should like to say that when you sit and distribute who comes from the owner's apartments and who comes from social housing, we can try to tell each other that it is not parent's income and that there is no difference in parent's income, but that is simply not true.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155340	The next brief remark is to Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155343	Thank you. After all, the Minister for Education began by saying that it was a pity that there were no brief comments on the previous proposal. One might well wonder why the Minister for Education did not take the floor at second reading of L 157. After all, ministers tend to do so to measure up to the proposals they put forward. The Socialist Minister chose not to do so. With what we are discussing here, it is not L 157; it is a citizen's proposal that more than 50,000 citizens are behind and that is about ensuring free choice for young people and not forced distribution on the basis of parental income. That is why I really want to ask the Minister whether he thinks it is respectful to young people that their own wishes are no longer taken into account, but that an algorithm should be created whereby their parents' income becomes such a coincidence factor, which will determine whether there is room in the high schools they are applying for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155438	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155441	So, I still do not understand, and I also said it in my speech, how one can at one and the same time have in one's head that one sees it as a free choice of high school that the parents' address, which most young people have no influence on when they are 15 years old, is what determines where one enters, while the parents' income, on which one also has no influence at the age of 15, is forced distribution and Soviet conditions. I don't understand how these things can be there at the same time. And I do not accept the premise. I don't think of either as coercion. I see this as a way of distributing pupils in relation to some rural areas where there is a concern for the individual and where there is a concern that schools should be able to survive. And the same is true in the larger cities in Denmark. There is both a consideration of the individual's choices and the need for schools to survive. And it's more than 90 percent who gets their wish gymnasium. It is with the old rules, and so is with the new rules. So I think you're trying to turn it up to something that it can't bear at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155540	Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155542	In other words, the Minister could have taken the floor for the second reading of L 157 if the Minister had wanted to stand up for the policy that the Socialists have put forward, namely that there should be a compulsory allowance on the basis of parental income. We do not want that; instead, we are spending our speaking time here on a citizens' proposal which is basically about some young people who are deeply concerned that their free choice no longer exists because they are making a forced model. That is why I would just like to ask my question again: does the Minister think that it is respectful to young people that in future they will be distributed on the basis of an algorithm-based model, where the outcome is largely determined by what their parents' incomes happen to be? Is it respectful to young people to do so?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155625	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155627	But there are simply more young people who get their wish gymnasium than in the present situation. In fact, I think that is respectful of them. So with the new model there are more not only than with the old agreement, but also more than with the old rules that get their wish gymnasium. I think that is respectful of them. Then it is true that it is distributed both in rural and urban areas, so that there are balanced training courses and so that we do not get an education desert throughout the Western region. But the number of students who will experience that they get their wish gymnasium will be the same • In fact, it will be bigger with the new than with the old rules. I think that's respectful.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155704	The next brief remark is to Mr. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155709	Thank you, President, and thank you to the Minister. Frankly, I think that the government's plans here, which are de facto forced redistribution between high schools, are probably the worst thing that has come from this government. This is at least one of the worst things, because you go in and mess with young people's dreams, and when the minister says that more people get their first choice, it is not right when you look at the areas where students are distributed against their wishes. When it is the case that the students themselves do not want it, and when it is the case that the parents themselves do not want it, why is it that the government goes in and tampers with it? Why is something as crucial as young people's dreams about what high school they can go to? It is young people who are currently in the eighth and ninth grade and who hope to enter a certain high school, but because the Minister says so, they must go to a completely different high school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155753	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155755	First of all, I would like to say that this is also the case today. And then I would like to ask the other way around: is it really the case that the students in the province of Denmark can be moved against their will? 'Cause that's how I understand it, as sir. Marcus Knuth's party does, that is, that you support the part of the agreement where you can say to a student in the province of Denmark: You may want to go in one place, but we blue parties have decided that you should go elsewhere. Is it fair to say that when the government wants to do the same in relation to the big cities, that is the worst thing the government has ever done? I mean, I just don't understand the rhetoric. I'm sorry, but I don't.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155831	Here you go with a follow-up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155833	The rhetoric is basically very simple. The government is trying to redistribute students in certain high school areas based on income. I mean, if it's not crying crazy to go in and mess with young people's dreams, I don't know what it is. In relation to the debate here in Parliament, in relation to the debate that is out there in the media... this is so controversial... and in relation to the fact that there is so much opposition to this, apart from the red parties, can the Minister explain how this is a good idea?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155859	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155901	Okay, in relation to a young person who lives somewhere in Jutland, I would say that we don't mess with the person's dreams by saying to him: you're not going to go to this one high school, but you're going to go to this other high school. But if you say exactly the same thing to a student in the capital, you say that it is something else, that it is coercion and that it is the worst thing that has ever happened. In other words, there is simply such a lack of coherence in what is being said from the blue camp in relation to this question that I am afraid I simply do not understand the premise set out for that question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155936	The next brief remark is to Mrs Britt Baker. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607155939	I have to say that there is also a great deal of variation in what the Minister is saying here. A study from Aarhus shows that the bus children transported from western Aarhus and around other schools to make them speak better Danish created the opposite result than was hoped for. They lost professionalism, they had enormously poor well-being, and they were lonely. The same study has been done in Paris, and it shows the same result. We have had a researcher in committee last week who said that it is exactly the same thing that is going to happen here. You can't integrate by forcing children to move. It does not provide good integration. Has the Minister not listened at all to any of the experts who have spoken about this and who say that the failure of integration cannot be resolved by the forced distribution of high school students?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160034	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160036	Uh, yeah. Both I and the parties to the agreement have done so, which is why it has been gratifying for us to be able to present to the public that there is a fall of more than 20%. in the number that has to move more than 40 minutes, with the proposal that we have put forward, and it is surely the distribution zones that we are talking about. This means that the number that has to move more than 40 minutes each day falls by more than 20 per cent. So we have listened, and that is why we have screwed up a model where transport time falls, also quite drastically, for those who have to move far. So if you didn't listen so much to the myths on Twitter, but instead got into what actually lies in the bill, it might not be appropriate to ask that question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160119	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160121	No, no, Minister, it wasn't Twitter. It was the experts, it was the studies, and that is the reality. This isn't working. The children who have been transported by bus have become less skilled, they are miserable and they have become lonely. They have not been integrated. That's what all the studies show. It's not something Twitter says, the echo chamber on Twitter; it's the experts. Why should the result be different by transporting high school students than by transporting primary school pupils? Why should high school pupils be better integrated by being coerced than primary school students?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160200	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160201	I certainly don't think they do. I think that research is right. Well, it's students coming from Herlev who are going to Herlev High School. This is what is happening with the new distribution of pupils, which means that it is not the case that pupils from Herlev should go to some random gymnasium somewhere else. That's why transport time is dropping. So I certainly think it's true when scientists say that busting the kids around doesn't work. That is just not what happens to the distribution of pupils, which means that that is the myth. I totally agree with the scientists about busting all sorts of things around all sorts of places. That is just not what this agreement is all about, so I think we should read both the agreement and the impact assessments of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160242	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160244	Thank you for the floor, President. Now there was a demonstration out here in front of Christiansborg Castle earlier today, and I was down to hear the many good speeches. Unfortunately, I did not see the Minister down there, but I hope that the Minister has been over because the young people tried so hard to shout out the Minister. And I just have to say that on the basis of the citizens' proposal, which is what we are dealing with today, there is a massive call from the people about this. They do not want to be forcibly distributed on the basis of their parents' purses. So is it just my question? the very simple question to the Minister is: does it not make the impression on the Minister that it is the massive call both on the basis of the citizens' proposal today and on the basis of the demonstration?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160331	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160333	Yes, indeed, but unfortunately I was in consultation. This is something that cannot be decided by the minister himself. So when it was 10:00 a.m., I was in consultation, but of course I joined the social media in what was going on down there, afterwards. And of course it makes an impression. It does so both with the citizens' proposal and with the very many inquiries we have received. That is why we have taken the initiative to actually draw up a supplementary agreement in the contract circle, that is to say. change, inter alia: on the drawing criterion, to which a great many responded, and where they said that it simply creates too much insecurity, that it is the drawing of lots that determines it. A lot of people also approached and said that this transport time to high school was of crucial importance. That was among other things. And some of what the scientists said. Now Mrs Britt Baker is no longer present in the Chamber, but one of the things that was referred to there is precisely this question of transport time. That is why, on this basis, we chose to substitute transport time instead of drawing lots. Of course it makes an impression. That is why we have three readings of legislative proposals in this Chamber. Actually, that's exactly for us to take in input. We have done so, and it is in the amendments and the new agreement that have been reached.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160442	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160443	Now I didn't ask about the transport time. I asked about the fact that the Minister still insists that it should be the parents' purse that decides it. And it's unusable, no matter how we turn it and turn it. So that's what the Minister won't answer when she starts talking about everything else that was irrelevant to my question. But the young people say, among other things.: my future, my choice, not the Minister's. Can the Minister not understand that, at the end of the day, perhaps it is not the Minister or the Government who are the best, most qualified people to decide this decision for the young people? Perhaps it was the young people and their parents who were best qualified to make a decision in the end.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160526	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160527	I totally agree with that. After all, we have presented a model in which more people get their wish gymnasium. In other words, the free choice of pupils is more taken into account than was the case with the old set of rules which have applied over the past many years. So I fully agree with that view. So I would say in relation to the thing about distributing and starting from income, that it is simply not true that it is foreign. What you do in municipal councils every year, you sit and lay school districts, you sit and scot to how much there is social housing, how much there are condominiums, how to get the best mix-up, and then you cut the school district off from it. It is a completely solid and integral part of Danish school history.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160606	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mr. Morten Dahlin, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160607	Thank you for that, President. The minister refers several times to the fact that in these distribution zones there are apparently only two types of high schools: those where everyone looks like you and those where nobody looks like you. So I simply do not agree with the Minister that this is the view of, for example, the United Kingdom. Count Gymnasium or Rødovre Gymnasium, that's the kind of school you run. And yet the government's forced distribution model, based on income, is going to go very hard on the two municipalities. That is why I would like to ask the Minister an open question: since we have seen demonstrations, since we have seen loud protests, since we have seen gatherings of both young people and parents in the Palace Square, and now we see a citizen's proposal with a great deal of opposition to this agreement, what does the Minister think it does to young people that from the start of their high school period they get such a stamp on their forehead where it says what their parents earn?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160706	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160707	But they don't.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160710	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160715	The minister spoke earlier about spin. I'm not going to be the minister's spin doctor, but if I were, maybe I'd advise to drop the one that kind of arrogant and better-informed attitude, because you divide young people into A, B and C teams, depending on what their parents earn. So I just ask again: what does the Minister think it does to the young people who are being distributed and deployed in certain categories and then placed in certain high schools, according to how much their mother and father earn?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160744	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160745	That is not what was in the first question. In the first question, the rapporteur indicated that it should be something that they knew about each other. It's not. In fact, I would think that was quite a matter of principle, i.e. that the different incomes of the pupils' parents were not presented to each other. So, of course, it is not available to each of them. Then I would say that I myself now live in an area of Copenhagen where, after all, the school districts distribute the pupils and have always made it very scenic whether we are talking about the residential neighbourhoods or the social housing areas. I think there are very good class communities also in those areas where income differences are large and where one gets mixed on the basis of school districts. I am convinced that will be the same here too. That's the way we've been used to going to primary school, so I guess it goes in high school too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160831	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Birgitte Bergman. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160834	Thank you. I would really like to follow up on Mrs Britt Baker's question, because I simply cannot understand why the Minister and all the parties behind this exercise are doing this exercise if it is not about the intention to integrate. Then why do you do this? Now that there are quite a few experts out shouting in arms and saying that there are going to be children who are going to be miserable and that you are precisely going to force the students to be distributed and risk distrust, because there are a few who are causing problems, what is the point?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160917	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607160919	The purpose of this agreement consists of different legs, but can all be especially crystallized in the secondary school law's paragraph paragraph. 2 and 3. The most important thing about our education system is two things. One is that you have to learn some professional things, i.e. pre-schooling when we talk about high school, and the other is that you have to learn to commit yourself in our society. Of course, if you are to learn to live in our society, it is important that we get to know each other crosswise, because otherwise you can only do it in the echo chamber from which you come. So it is clear that some of this is about the worst part of it being expressed where we have definite parallel societies and ghetto schools, as it has been called with a little ugly words. It's the hardest and the worst variant of it. But the same applies to everyone else; if we do not get to know each other, how should we learn to commit ourselves in the society in which we live? So you can say that if we are to live up to those parts of the paragraph of purpose and those I have not really heard either the Left or the Conservatives want to change on the page one has to make a suggestion on how to do it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161024	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161026	Frankly, most people do not choose a high school which is one hour away from where they live, where they have their friends, where they have their leisure jobs, where they have to have their everyday life to hang together. So now you're gonna go in there and force these kids, and it's gonna be all that's gonna make a lot of trouble. I simply cannot understand why the Minister does not recognise the many hundreds of children and parents who have stood down here this morning, who were very many, and do not recognise that it is a huge problem that they are now being deprived of that choice and that they are now being taken away from a huge distance from those pupils who are now being forced to move to another high school, that is to say an hour's drive away. So that's a long time for a young person. I have two daughters of my own who have been in high school, so I know what I'm talking about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161121	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161122	I recommend reading the additional agreement to the agreement that we have reached, because that is one of the things that we do have. because of the citizens' requests we have received, not least from some of those who have also participated in today's activities, that we have chosen to change, so we have taken the element of drawing lots out of the agreement and replaced it with a transport criterion. This has the consequence that the number of pupils who have to travel far is falling, also quite dramatically, both in relation to the old agreement, but in fact also in relation to the old rules, which means that there are fewer pupils who will have to travel so far than there have been in the past many years, and that is because we have listened to, among other things. the input we have received from those who have participated in today's events.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161204	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Gitte Willumsen, Conservative. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161207	Thank you for that, President. Earlier in the debate, the Minister said that no one had to be busted around. I simply do not understand that when the proposal talks about transport time. Who, then, is going around those buses if it is not the students when the minister said earlier that no one had to be busted around?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161229	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161230	What I am saying is that there are fewer people who have to be transported far than today. Both in relation to the old agreement, but also in relation to the old rules. In the distribution zones, the number of students to travel far falls by more than 20%, and when it does, it is because, as it is today, and now takes the metropolitan area as a starting point, the young people living in Hvidovre and Herlev are looking away Hvidovre and Herlev Gymnasium because they do not want to go to a high school where no one looks like themselves. With the future rules, more of them will be kept at home, so to speak. So if you had to criticize the agreement for something, because we may well disagree on something, it is that it is more keeping the students at home. This means that students coming from Hvidovre will go more to Hvidovre Gymnasium, and students coming from Herlev will go more to Herlev Gymnasium. This then means that people should not be busted so that those who do not get their first priority and have not chosen of their own free will will go more to their local high school. That's why transport time is falling.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161334	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161336	I think someone will try to keep the minister up on that, that is, that you should not be busted out of your own municipality. Because what this is all about is well-being. And experts have said a lot about that, and when the minister says that when they go to their nearby high school, they get to be with someone who doesn't look like them, I ask: isn't that exactly the problem: that you get to feel lonely and miserable when you're forced into a place where you don't want to be, because you can't mirror yourself in those you're going to be with?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161414	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161414-2	Yeah, that's why we want student distribution. For what the student distribution can do, it's compared to the fact that those high schools aren't there anymore. There will no longer be high schools with 60-70 percent. with other ethnic backgrounds, e.g. And that means that there is no risk of going to a high school where you, for example, become a minority culture. So the whole idea and the reason we do the student distribution is to get the students distributed in a way, so that, for example, there are no parallel community ghetto schools, as they have been called in a slightly ugly word.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161448	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Mette Thiesen from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161449	Thank you so much. This isn't a new debate. The minister and I have had it since I was elected in the Danish Parliament 2019, and we made the original agreement on student distribution, which we from the New Citizens' side were the only party outside. After all, the minister is arguing for this with mixed classes and mixed high schools, etc., and that speaks for the fact that the whole basis of this is of course some kind of integration exercise. In other words, where you try to solve a problem, because you have been giving birth to a misguided alien policy for many years, leaving the bill in the teenage room. And that's what this is all about, because there's really no evidence that basically justifies that this is going to solve any problems at all. So can the Minister not just explain why the Minister thinks it is a good idea that it is Danish children and young people who have to pay the price for misguided immigration policy for many years, and that therefore we see these so-called ghetto ghetto gymnasiums or immigrant gymnasiums?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161557	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161557-2	I think they are paying the price today, and I think that is perhaps the difference between Mrs Mette Thiesen's and my assessment of the situation. I think that the young people in Herlev and Hvidovre, and everywhere else, are paying the price for having just let go. And that means that young people with Danish backgrounds living in Herlev and Hvidovre cannot see themselves in their local high school because it has become what they call ghetto high schools. That is what we want to do away with, so that the young people who live in Herlev and Hvidovre can go to their local high school and can see themselves in the student composition that is. So my analysis is that it has been allowed to sail, and nothing has been done about it by the blue parties when they had the power of government. And you still haven't a single idea of how to solve the problem, and that has meant that one high school after another, especially in the Western part of Copenhagen, has collapsed because the composition of the student has become so crooked. I simply do not think we can be familiar with this, and I therefore believe that, in relation to the description that you should have left the bill in the teen room, that is exactly what you have been doing over the past many years when you have not tackled and solved the problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161701	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161702	In New Citizens we have a very clear solution, and that is to solve immigration policy from the bottom up. But what is so good about free choice is that you can choose something else, but you can also choose something from it. But can choose a high school from where you just can't see for yourself, and choose something else. And it also allows the students, possibly with other ethnic backgrounds, who live in these areas and actually want to break this negative social heritage, to choose something else. So why is it that the minister wants this distribution here, where instead of just having the problems in some individual schools in principle they will spread them out to a great many and destroy it for a great many well-functioning high school students?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161738	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161739	It is because I see it as such that the problem only arises when you cram people together very much. And then I'm just confused by the fact that solving immigration policy from the bottom up maybe it's just me. Now it was sir. Morten Dahlin before, who would be my special advisor, and now it may be that I will be Mrs. Mette Thiesen's special advisor. I simply do not understand what this means, and certainly not in this context, i.e. the question of resolving foreign policy from the bottom up. What does that mean? Now I am not the one asking questions, but I simply do not understand it. But there may be an explanation for this later in this debate, so that the rest of us can also understand what it is really covering up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161815	Thank you to the Minister for Children and Education, there are no more brief comments. The first rapporteur is Mr Beazley. Jens Joel of the Social Democrats, whose time it is now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607161834	Thank you to the President, and thank you to the number of citizens, parents and young people who have drafted a citizens' proposal, signed it and had it put forward. This is another opportunity to discuss the agreement made in the field of upper secondary education, but also the free choice, that is to say how we actually organize our secondary schools and how we organize our upper secondary educations, so that at one and the same time we take the best possible account of what young people want, of course, in relation to what kind of education they want and where we also take as much account as possible of which land they want to take their education. After all, the citizens' proposal is that we should have free secondary school elections for everyone, and I think it was the rapporteur of the Left, Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby, who said earlier in the debate that we are no longer laying the foundations for the wishes of young people. And it's nice to have a debate where you can get some of the ghosts in the ground, because it's like today and forward-looking that the first thing you're looking at is: Where do the young people really want to go to high school if that's what they want? It is clear that if you want a trade gymnasium, it is high on the priority list that you get your priority education, but if you want different stx departments, it is of course also about meeting the wishes of young people for cadastrals as much as possible. And it can be said that in free secondary school elections to everyone, as the citizens' proposal is called, there is also, in the premise that there is complete freedom of movement. There is no such thing today, and I have never known it. There are some colleges where there are more applicants than there are seats, and that is why it is quite like today that when you have more applicants for the same high school than there are places, there must be a distribution. This is the discussion we have had in the past and where there is actually a broad consensus that a distribution may be necessary. We heard that the Left thinks that when it comes to saving the high schools in the thinner populated areas, it is a positive thing for the young people when they are distributed to something other than what they wanted. But if the same thing happens, that is, that they do not get their first priority in the big cities, then it is a matter of forced distribution. And that simply doesn't add up. There's always been a distribution. There's a small part that doesn't get their first priority, and there's always been one. In fact, the proportion that does not have their first priority falls a little bit with the agreement we have made. And in relation to one of the criticisms that has also been raised here, namely whether there is going to be further to high school, it is essential that there is in fact a shorter journey time for more people, even in the distribution zones, simply because they are going to the local high school to a greater extent. And one of the things that, of course, helps to do this, and to which we must also recognise the process of contributing, is that, if there are more people competing for the same place, you choose to look at the distance criterion, in the distribution models. And one can say that it is a small step away from the free choice, where it was the drawing of lots, as there was also someone who thought was a good model. Now we look at distance instead, and that really only strengthens the local element. In 2016, the then Minister for Education of the Left, Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby, said that they wanted new rules for the distribution of pupils; they wanted to do with what was called ghetto high school. In fact, however, it went so far that it was said that it wanted an immediate debate on it, so that from next school year, i.e. from 2017, the polarisation that had taken place in those high schools, especially in the largest urban areas, could be ended. The polarisation has since 2016 and 2017, when the Left Minister of Education wanted to end the ghetto school, has only gone in the wrong direction, that is, the problem and the challenge have increased to a great extent, and the Left's ability and/or desire to solve the problem has in turn diminished. And I think that is a pity, not least because it is a social challenge, just like the one we have in the thinner populated areas where we have to have a student distribution to ensure that all young people actually have a quality gymnasium in their relative proximity. So we do not support the resolution here. We believe we have made an agreement that, although it is not perfect, takes care of the challenges we face, both in rural areas and in the largest cities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162351	Thank you. The first brief remark is to Mr Seligman. Morten Dahlin. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162353	Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. I have noticed in this debate that when the Social Democratic Party gets a little bit on the blade, you always try to care about the high principles and talk about the fact that it is about a broad distribution and about breaking some negative patterns. It is very rare to deal with the specific challenges that exist in reality. That is why I would like to ask a specific question based on a specific high school: what challenge does the Social Democracy at Rødovre Gymnasium, which is so great that in future fewer students from Rødovre Gymnasium will have to go to?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162432	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162434	You can say that in shoe lengths and that's why the journey time falls, that, if you may say, there will be more people who end up at the local high school. But Mr. After all, Morten Dahlin is right, and that is actually why you have to lift up, that is how it is, just as the rapporteur from the Left said before, that if you do not guarantee a minimum capacity at Lemvig High School, someone will end up with bucks at Lemvig High School. Therefore, you cannot necessarily let all those who would like to go to Holstebro Gymnasium come to Holstebro. It is so obvious, one must understand, a freedom struggle in Rødovre for the Left, but in Lemvig it is not important for the young people. But it's all connected, and it's like a whole, both in the West region of Copenhagen, in Aarhus, where I live, and in the West Jutland. That is why we are discussing what is called student distribution and ensuring balanced composite colleges across.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162533	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162535	I note that the rapporteur did the same again, namely not to answer the question, not to give a single answer to what is the case in Rødovre. I'll try another high school. What challenges with skewed student composition is what the Social Democratic Party considers to be so great at Count Gymnasium, where there is more than 20%. with an immigrant background today? What challenges are there so great that more Greve students in the future cannot be allowed to go to their local high school because their parents earn the wrong amount?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162604	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162607	Again: Well, if there is no problem here, but there is a very big problem there, then you can choose to say that you do not think it is important to solve the problem. Then I do not understand what the then Minister of Education of the Left said when they wanted to do away with the ghetto schools and wanted a new distribution, a new distribution of pupils. But it is clear that, just as Lemvig and Holstebro are connected, Greve, Rødovre, Hvidovre and Herlev Gymnasium are also linked to ensuring overall that all colleges have a real chance of success and that all young people have a local high school which is attractive to attend both professionally and socially.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162655	The next brief remark is to Mrs Britt Baker. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162656	Thank you. In his speech, the Minister said that we must do away with the whimsical high schools, and the rapporteur says in his speech that we must prevent social control and ensure that high schools are mixed. The rapporteur himself has been involved in meetings of experts, and I hope the rapporteur has also read the reports that show that children are not better integrated by being forced somewhere. Children lose professionalism, they lose well-being, and they do not make any more friends if they are to be transported among others. Does the rapporteur not even recognise the research that is being carried out here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162740	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162741	Mrs Britt Baker also raised the question with the Minister, and when you address the criticism that has been made, for example in Aarhus, that there are some children who go to school further away from where they live than they would otherwise have been, I fully recognise that there is a tradeoff in that. It's just a bit strangely critical of this deal, which means that we're shortening transport time. Mrs Britt Baker should then clap her hands and say: finally, it has been learned from the fact that the move of children and students far away goes beyond the well-being and that they therefore have to go locally. This can be seen when transport time overall falls. So there are more people who get a shorter journey time. So I understand what Mrs Britt Baker is trying to refer to. I just think that it is a slightly biased criticism of an agreement that actually gives less transport time, more location, if you like, and a more local high school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162840	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162841	I simply refuse to believe that the rapporteur is so ill-advised that he cannot see through an average figure, because of course there are some who get longer transport time, and they will be precisely those who do not benefit from longer transport time. When the rapporteur says that there is a shorter journey time, it is an average, and so it is because in the future many of those who live in Herlev and choose Herlev from will be forced to stay at the high school in Herlev, otherwise this exercise could not go up. The rapporteur must then acknowledge that some will have longer transport time, that some will have to be busted around and that this will be detrimental to their well-being and integration. Does the rapporteur not agree with that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162931	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607162932	I do not understand why you raise a criticism that has been raised by the bus children in Aarhus, and say that if they get the local high school, it is worse. I agree with Mrs Britt Baker that it would probably be the case that there are more people living close to Herlev Gymnasium who would actually choose Herlev Gymnasium if Herlev Gymnasium was a mixed high school, because I believe that some of those who today choose Herlev Gymnasium do so because they think it has become a skewed high school. This means that the young people do not have a good local high school that they think they can be at and to which they think they fit. That is why today they have a longer journey time than they will have in the future if they want to enter Herlev Gymnasium.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163020	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Mette Thiesen from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163024	Thank you so much. As I said to the Minister before, there is the fine thing about free elections that you can actually choose from. Alternatively, the government and the support parties choose to make a model which simply distributes the problems to several schools, and I would really like to hear the rapporteur about something in that context. The rapporteur is familiar with the study, which is called "Qualitative examination of the nature and causes of negative social control on upper secondary educations" made for STUK in 2019, which is just talking about this with self-segregation, so that although there are actually quite a few of those who create the problems of some of these mainly immigrant gymnasiums, if they are moved around, they will still self-segregate themselves and have this negative social control, for example, etc. So, on the basis of the study that is being carried out, can the rapporteur not actually just conclude that, even if these young people are being distributed, the problems are being distributed more widely rather than solved?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163121	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163123	The questioner starts by saying that the beauty of free choice is that you can just choose from. So, the challenge of the free choice that exists today is that you can actually choose something else and get into a high school that you think is attractive. Because today it is the case that what determines whether you are coming in is where your parents can afford to live where you live and it is clear that if you live in one of the places where you are close to a high school you do not want to stay at, you are also in the back of the queue for some of the others, and it is really, really hard to get into the popular high schools today if you do not have parents who live close to them. In other words, I am in favour of new citizens, and this is also seen in other areas, perhaps not recognising the actual reality, in relation to what are the limitations today. You may have a desire to make total freedom of choice, but that is just not what exists today, and that is why I do not recognise that you should go from having a free choice to not having a free choice. It is obvious when you still take away the desire of young people that that is where you start. Instead of distributing at a distance, you will distribute on a mixture. And, of course, what the questioner says is that we do not necessarily solve all the problems of parallel societies, but I would venture to say that it is easier to deal with an unhealthy culture if it is not the majority that is like covering it up. That is why, of course, there will be a point in us undertaking the tasks, whether they are social, integration or anything else, together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163259	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163301	Thank you to the rapporteur for answering the question. In other words, the rapporteur, the rapporteur's party, the government and the support parties say quite frankly and openly: yes, okay, there has been a misguided immigration policy, children must pay for it; it is the children and young people who have to pay for it, and now we are making this distribution model. Well, basically, that's what you're saying. Because we can see from the research that there is no real indication that it is working. But you have this ideological crusade that you have to distribute, and then you're going to spread the problems out into several high schools instead of just sitting down and saying: let's solve the problems from the bottom up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163342	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163344	I think we all still have the benefit of hearing what it really is about solving it from the bottom up. So, are the young people going to disappear from the face of the earth, or what are they really imagining? No, what we do is to say that, of course, it is easier to overcome parallel societal trends, of course it is easier to ensure integration and, of course, it is easier to ensure both cultural and religious integration, but also social integration if you actually have mixed high schools. For the unhealthy culture, which can be reproduced in many contexts in all sorts of groups in society, gets the easiest by dominating if it also dominates the student group that is there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163426	Thank you very much to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Morten Dahlin from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163450	Thank you for the floor, President. We have a principle here in Denmark when it comes to education, and it is actually a principle that has been widely agreed politically for years. I don't want your parents' wallet to decide what kind of education you're gonna get. It is a sound principle; it has served Denmark well, and it has helped create a country where it is not one's economic background that determines which school to go to. Equal access to education means that children's opportunities in life do not depend on their parents' finances. This is what the Social Democrats' website says in black and white. When you read that sentence, it is of course surprising that it is precisely a social democratic government that will now introduce a system in which pupils' access to education will depend precisely on their parents' finances. It just doesn't make sense. When we first had the debate on the new law of compulsory distribution here in the Danish Parliament, it was probably only the few who realized which system the red political majority wanted to pull over the heads of the future high school students in and around the larger cities, not in the distance zones, we have discussed this, but in and around the larger cities. It's changed now, thank God. Several people have realised this, and it is not least thanks to a number of very committed students, parents, teachers and rectors who have all called out guard in arms. That is why I should like to express my sincere thanks to those who have taken the initiative on the citizens' proposal we are discussing here today. I can of course also say that the Left supports the proposal. And why do we do that? Yes, we do, because, like thousands and thousands of Danes, we cannot see the reason for the forced distribution of high school students according to their parents' income. We think it's a stupid idea to stamp them in the forehead with how much their parents earn and then divide them into an A-, a B- and a C- team. So we simply cannot support what is being done in the distribution zones, namely to drastically cut over 20,000 pupils' free choice of school, very strongly indeed! Just think of the students who are now being told that they cannot enter their local high school because their parents are making the wrong money. Think of Sofie, who is no longer allowed to go to school with her friends because her mother makes too little money. Think of Lucas, who lives 500 metres from his local high school, but who is now being forced to transport himself up to several other high schools to get to the school that the government has chosen for him, only because his mother earns too much. That is, in principle, wrong. I haven't met a single student who is at risk of being coerced on the basis of the parents' income, who backs this up not one! This is probably due to the fact that the proposal for forced distribution is actually quite anti-youth and it reveals a view of youth, which is very far away from the Left. We don't see young people as some people you can just move around like in a game of chess, we don't see young people as the foot soldiers of the Minister of Education, who are going to fight her ideological battle, and we don't see them as the property of the state that can be moved around, as it pleases the government, and certainly not this generation of young people. We have a historically responsible youth. They drink less than previous generations, and they fight less; on the other hand, they vote more and train better. During the Corona crisis, they took a huge responsibility and once again showed that we have a historically responsible youth, and yet they are repeatedly faced by the government, and now by a majority of the people, with bans, coercion and mistrust. I think it is an unfortunate signal to send to the Danish youth very unfortunately. In the Left, we basically do not think that it is the Prime Minister or the Government who is best at choosing where to go to school, based on a forced distribution model in relation to their parents' income. I would therefore like to call on the parties to the agreement to listen to the many who are concerned, to listen to those who have protested, to listen to those who have demonstrated, to listen to those who have created and signed a citizens' proposal, and then to drop the mess that has been done in the distribution zones. We're gonna be constructive and go into the discussions. I promise. On the other hand, I also promise that if you do not listen and if you do not come to your senses, a new bourgeois government with the Left in the lead will roll back the forced distribution on the basis of parents' income. It's a promise that everyone can count on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607163956	Thank you. The first brief remark goes to Mr Seligman. Jens Joel of the Social Democrats. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164001	Thank you, sir. Morten Dahlin for the speech. There was a lot of talk about Sofie and Lucas that you had to think about. There are also quite a few young people who today have a challenge with their local high school either because it is closing or because there is such an imbalance that you do not want to go there. And what really is the Left's answer to the young people who today do not have a good local high school? Or I can also ask in another way: what is it that the Left thinks should be distributed in the cities?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164032	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164034	Well, I think that this is an interesting question from the Social Democrat Party, and it really reveals the ideological dividing line. Sofie and Lucas are not satisfied with their high school today, and the social democracy solution is: let us force someone to go there. The left's solution is to say: let's sit down and find out how we can make the high school more attractive. I basically don't believe that you make Herlev Gymnasium a better place to go because you force someone from Herlev, from Gentofte, from Lyngby to get there. Basically, I don't believe that. I can tell from this debate that the Social Democrats believe in that. I just need to see what evidence is behind it; I can't find it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164115	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164116	So, it sounds undoubtedly as if the Left has a somewhat different view than what the Liberal Minister for Education called in 2016 a student distribution that should end with the so-called ghetto schools. But what is a bit frivolous here is that it is actually the rapporteur who is standing on the platform, and that is why it is actually we who have the opportunity to ask questions: what is it that the Left wants to distribute?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164145	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164146	But I do think that the question raised by the Social Democratic Party reveals the difference in Danish politics, and I hope that the Danes will soon be able to decide in which direction we are going, by the polls, namely whether the way to solve social challenges is by forcing and, in particular, forcing young people to do some things that they basically do not want to do, or by, for example, by. To say: Hey, how do we make this high school more attractive? How do we actually get someone to choose it for? There the Social Democrats simply choose mistrust and coercion, and there we want a different path.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164218	Thank you. The next rapporteur, with a brief comment, is Mrs Astrid Carøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164222	Thank you. It is something of a break in the Left that you no longer want to have any distribution among the high schools, because I understand that if you adopt this citizens' proposal, you will have free secondary school elections in Denmark. That means that we should not distribute the students at all. Is that what the Left wants from now on?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164240	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164241	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164243	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164245	Okay, but what is it that the Left wants? Because that's what we can't get an answer to. Over and over again, we cannot get an answer to that. We have heard that the Left has been saying for many years that we have a challenge in the field of high school that we have to solve. Now we find a solution, but the Left will not take responsibility for finding a solution with us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164300	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164301	Well, it's only in this cheese bell at Christiansborg that you can seriously present a model that's completely wrong in principle, that's going to run into a lot of practical problems that there's huge local resistance to, and then stand to say: Well, what are you guys gonna do? What we want to do is to create a model in which there is a greater degree of freedom of choice in the distribution zones than there is in it, I think, bureaucratic hell, which is being set up from a party that otherwise claims to be concerned with the distrust of young people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164333	The next brief remark is to Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164337	Now I don't think it's only here at Christiansborg that you want to ask: if you don't want to do this, what do you want to do? And especially when we now have an example that the Left repeatedly took the first time in 2016 with Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby in charge, and then Mr. In addition, Morten Dahlin was a special adviser calling for new rules for the distribution of pupils, which we were hoping would start from the next school year. Subsequently, it has been repeated that there was no rejection of any model, as long as it could solve the problem of skewed pupil composition and what the Left calls ghetto education. I just have to ask: what are the rules that the Left wants? Or was it just plainly a lie that you wanted to have some new student distribution rules?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164418	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164419	I simply have to say something to the radical rapporteur. There is a quote in which Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby has said that there are some wise people who need to look at this and that she will not reject the solutions in advance. Then you are accused that you are not just buying the government model with the radical support to force benefits based on parental income. The rapporteur cannot find a single place from the time when Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby was sitting in the Ministry of Education, where she proposes the forced distribution of high school pupils in and around the major cities based on parental income. That is not the policy of the Left, it is not liberal politics. It's obviously • and I think that's going to disappoint really, very many people • radical politics.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164500	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164502	Yes, it is radical policy to take responsibility for ensuring young people's educational opportunities, and it is quite right that the Left does not want this solution. I therefore ask: what solution is the Left's desire? What do you want to distribute after if not after income? If you want new student distribution rules that is what I read out in the big cities, according to what criteria do you want to have them? The answer was that schools should be made attractive, but what has been said in the past was that they wanted new distribution rules, they wanted a less biased composition of pupils. Has the Left changed its position? Yes or no?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164533	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164533-2	The Left has not changed its position. But I must also arrest one thing that the radical rapporteur says, namely that we just Well, the Left has never said that you just I think it is actually quite a difficult task. I don't think it's something you just sort of solve. In fact, I believe that this is something that requires serious political reflection and serious political negotiations. For example: The Left, when it was intended to negotiate the agreement on the distribution of pupils, said that it should have been linked to the taximeter reform, because we do not escape the fact that some of this also requires some money, which requires some economic muscle. Unfortunately, this was denied by the government.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164609	The next brief remark is to Mrs Katrine Robsøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164612	Thank you. I don't think you hear Radical complaining about trying to make high schools more attractive, so people choose them and want to go there. I haven't heard anyone else say they don't want to look at that either. But no matter how attractive and I really hope that the Left will recognise that we do different high schools, there will always be some high schools that will probably be more sought than others, where there is simply no room for all those who apply, and then there will be other high schools where there are therefore some free places. How does the Left want to distribute the young people in the cities?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164657	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164658	Well, I have to say to the radical questioner here that the radical questioner is absolutely right, because no matter how many interventions the Radical Left makes in the free school elections of the young people, which I actually thought were something radical Left actually cared about, there will always be some high schools that are more attractive than others. There are always some that more will seek, and is that in itself a problem? No, I really do not think so, and if you say it is a problem, I am sure that you go very, very far down the path where you need to restrict the free choice of school for young people. So what is perhaps the fundamental disagreement between the Radical Left and the Left here is that I buy the analysis and that I also accept that there will always be some high schools that will be more sought than others.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164741	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164743	Good. So if sir... Morten Dahlin agrees that it is a basic premise how does Mr. Morten Dahlin saw to it that we get the students distributed among these high schools? Frankly, I find it frightening that the Left keeps standing and saying that we should just take a look at that. I have not heard any good proposal from the Left yet on how we go in and find a solution to this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164809	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164809-2	I haven't been telling you this is something we just need to look at. I have recognised that this is a difficult task, it is something I think we are demanding to look deep into the toolbox, for example. in connection with a taximeter reform so that you can get the economic muscles that make you able to create an attractive gymnasium. The rapporteur considers this to be frightening. What I find frightening is that a party that has liberalised in its name, Denmark's Social Liberal Party, goes in with open eyes and cuts thousands of young people's free school choices in and around the big cities, and you are even proud of it. I don't understand.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164843	The next question is Mrs Lotte Rod from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164845	Will the Left distribute the students by grades instead of by social background?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164851	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164852	Now the rapporteur says instead of after social background. Social and economic considerations are not necessarily the same, and what we have chosen to do here is based on economic considerations. No, we do not have any clear proposal that then you should distribute based on grades. We do not have that in disappointment, if that is what the rapporteur is asking.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164911	Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164911-2	Okay, so these aren't grades, but what is it that the Left wants to distribute? I have heard that taximeter negotiations have been said. Does this mean that the Left will take money from the most sought-after high schools and give them to the high schools that are not enough sought? Is that what the Left model is?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164927	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164928	The left model and the Left's wish are, of course, in the taximeter negotiations that we believe should have been taken, while at the same time making the rules for the allocation of pupils. We need to see if we can give some of the high schools that are challenged, and it can in fact be many places in the country, some larger economic muscles in order to create some attractive study environments. So, yes, one of the things the Left would like to do is clearly to look at the economy and therefore also the taximeter reform.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164951	The next brief remark is to Mr. Jakob Silverhøj from Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607164952	Now I have heard the Left scolding for hours on the agreement that has been reached and that these changes will be rewinded. What will they actually be rewinded to when the rapporteur of the Left puts so much emphasis on saying that they will be rewinded? What exactly will the electorate expect after an election?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165016	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165017	A system where there is more freedom of choice for the thousands of young people in and around the larger cities who will now see their free choice of school cut sharply.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165029	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165030	But even if the rapporteur is now looking forward to changes, is it not the case that the electorate can be given a clear message as to what is the alternative to the Left?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165042	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165043	Yes, the voters can do that. The voters can certainly count on the fact that if the Left gets a political majority in this Parliament and I have heard the same from the other blue parties... there will be a model in and around the larger cities where more pupils will have their first priority, so that we give higher priority to free choice of school than with this agreement, where you will be forced to distribute pupils around on the basis of their parents' income.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165111	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Astrid Carøe of the Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165119	Thank you. This citizen's proposal will ensure free choice in high schools in Denmark. That is why I think I would like to start by telling you a little bit about what the system is like today. Today you are distributed on the basis of distance, number of miles from your home to your high school. It's like 92 percent. I'm gonna give them their first priority today. It's great, and it's really a lot, and even though there's no free choice of high school, only 8% aren't given their first priority. There are also some who are given their second or third priority, which is why there are 3%. Today, that does not get one of their priorities. Then we've made a new distribution agreement. It means that outside the big cities we are now distributing not on the basis of kilometres, but on the basis of transport time, i.e. how long it takes to get to our local high school. That is because there is a huge difference between what, for example. 20 km is in transport time. In some places where there is good public transport, 20 km can take 15 minutes and elsewhere 45 minutes. It makes a lot of sense to do it. Then there are the big cities where we distribute on the basis of socio-economics instead of on the basis of distance. We in the SF also think this makes great sense because it offers more opportunities to look for schools that are not right next to where you live. Some of the very popular high schools in this inner city have been searched so much today that you cannot get into them unless you live right around the corner. With the new agreement, 94 per cent. is going to be their first priority. It's a little more than the old deal, but it's about the same thing. So there's 6% that don't get. 3% of them get their second or third priority, and 3%. do not receive one of the priorities they have asked for. So it is true that it is not a free choice of high school, just as it is not today. For these 3%. After all, both today and with the new agreement, we are talking about 100 per cent. of their high school, where they have not chosen the school they have entered. That is why we in the SF also think it is important that we take care of the students, that we ensure that they, for example. from the point of view of the school closest to where they live, if they do not get any of the ones they have wanted. That is what we have ensured with this supplementary agreement that we have just made, and that is why we are very pleased that someone has called out and said that it is therefore necessary. But all in all, I think it is a really good solution that we have found after many years of discussion of what the solution could be in this area. We're holding hands during close-down high schools, and we're securing children and young people, about as free choice as there are today, so these are the 94 percent who get their first priority. There was no doubt that we were going to find a new model. The one we have now is not working, and for many years pupils, student organisations and teachers have been expressing the need for a new distribution. There are high schools that are closed today, and that is alarming because all young people must have the opportunity to get an education, no matter where they live in the country. If the close-down high schools actually close, I think it will mean that more young people will drop out of education. That's why it's crucial that these high schools now have the opportunity to break the evil spiral they've been in for so many years. The agreement provides a new basis for students and ensures that we have high schools throughout the country. At the same time, it has also been important for us that young people in high schools move in diverse environments where there is room for everyone. The Minister has already quoted the Danish High School Students Association, which has said that as the model is now, young people can choose a high school where everyone looks like them or where nobody does. We don't think that's gonna do us any good. That is why the agreement also ensures that young people are not lumped together on the basis of socio-economic or cultural backgrounds. I hear that free elections mean a lot, and I understand that. But with this agreement we also ensure, in relation to the big cities, that you can look for a school that is not right next to where you live, so you can live in the West and still seek Rysensteen Gymnasium It is absolutely impossible to get in there today. Because so far it has been about having a low postal code and an expensive condo in order to get into some of the most popular high schools in the country. As far as the longer journey time is concerned, I am very pleased with the fact that it is also mentioned in the citizens' proposal that the expectation is that the vast majority will have one of their four priorities met. So it's these 3% that don't, and I'm glad we've made sure that those who don't get into a high school that's at most 45 minutes away from where they live, but I'd like to get even closer. Nowadays, that limit is 60 km, so transport time is going to be shorter with this deal than it was before. I think that's what I wanted to say. We do not support this citizens' proposal, because we think we have found a really, really good model for the distribution of pupils in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165624	Thank you. There are a few brief comments. First, Mrs Britt Baker from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165627	Thank you for that and thank you for your speech to the SF rapporteur. I noticed that the rapporteur said that student organisations, teachers and rectors have been asking for a new model for years, and so I would just like to ask the rapporteur: have the parties to the agreement, after the change has been made after it has been made, that the colleges have to fund parts of this agreement, have they sent this proposal with the change in consultation and asked these organisations again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165658	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165700	It is true that it costs something to make such an agreement, and unfortunately we have not been able to find that money elsewhere, among other things. Because the Left and Conservatives said that we could not use the unspent funds that were over in the high school conciliation circle, and then we had to find the means here, but our clear vision is that we should invest more in high schools forward-looking, and we would also like to see when we have a taximeter debate, that it will not be a zero-sum game and that more money will come into the high school area. I know they're really tired of having to finance it themselves. So are we. That's how the solution was, and then we have to secure more money when we're going to have this taximeter scheme, but what I hear from the high school rectors and from the Danish Gymnasium and Danske Gymnasielevers Association isn't that they would have been without it, but that, yes, they're tired of having to finance it themselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165752	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165754	But the rapporteur did not answer my question, so I can answer it myself. They have not been heard after the change. The amendment has not been sent out for consultation to the relevant parties, and I can now read out what one of them says: the funding of the student-sharing agreement means, in effect, moving money from education to administration. Generally speaking, it is a great pity that it will be schools which will finance the agreement. This basically means that teaching money will go to an IT system, and of course we do not think that is sensible. Birgitte Vedersø, chairman of the Danish High School, says. Shouldn't this amendment have been in consultation, Mrs Astrid Carøe?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165840	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165843	Yeah, it probably should, but we've been really busy with this. I'd say I've talked to the organizations. I didn't realize they hadn't been heard, but I understand it's a disgrace. I understand that, and I wish we could have found that money in the high school circle, but the Left and Conservatives put an end to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165906	Thank you. The next question is Mr. Morten Dahlin from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607165909	You have to hear a lot of nonsense before your ears fall off, as I think the Minister of Education was told at the beginning. That SF now accuses the Left and Conservatives of spending nearly 200 million. kr. I think that administration and IT costs for a model that we are fundamentally opposed to must be characterised as nonsense. I will move on to my question. At first reading, I asked the draft law SF's rapporteur, who unfortunately was not the rapporteur on the platform now for the well-being of young people. For SF is very concerned that young people are miserable today, and that you have to do something to make them thrive better. And at the same time, I am actually experiencing SF's concern and recognition that we have a historically responsible youth who basically makes quite reasonable choices. Therefore, my question is twofold: What does SF basically think is wrong with the choices that students make today, compared to what high school they want to go to? That was the first question. The second question is: what does the SF's rapporteur think the consequences for the well-being will be in connection with this bill, which is insisted on voting through by a narrow majority here in the Folketing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170011	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170013	First of all, I think I would like to start by regretting that I was not here for the first reading of the draft law. Now that is not what we are discussing today. However, you cannot be in two places at once, and I am also an educational rapporteur, and the Reform Commission came up with its things that day. But now we're dealing with this citizen's proposal. I will see if I can answer the questions put by the rapporteur there were some. In relation to the welfare of young people, as I said in my speech, it is true that for the 3% that with this new agreement will not have one of their priorities, it is about 100 per cent. of their high school hours. I do not deny that it is really a pity not to enter the educational institution that has been desired, and that is why we must support it, for example. will be the educational institution closest to the student's home, and that's what we've done with this supplementary agreement. I just want to say that I do not believe that this agreement will do neither from nor for the well-being of young people. What does happen from time to time is that we ensure that there is peace, that the young people are not pushed through the education system, as the Left has unfortunately been advocating for many years, and that we do not have this crazy focus on grades that we experience both in primary and secondary school, which is what the students say the most pressure is on them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170122	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170124	Should I understand SF's rapporteur so that SF does not believe that it has an impact on the well-being of the individual student if one is forced to move from Herlev to Birkerød or from Greve to High Taastrup or from Vangede to Herlev? Does the rapporteur not see that this is not in line with reality? You are removed from your local environment, you are removed from your friends, you are removed from your leisure activities. Doesn't the SF just have a little concern that young people's well-being might be affected?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170156	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170157	I am simply very sorry that the rapporteur did not hear either my speech or what I just said, namely that, as far as the 3% do not get one of their priorities, it is 3%. Today, and it is going to be forward-looking; and the rapporteur can shake his head so much, but it is 3% that is mentioned in the figures, and if it gets much more, I think we should also go back and look at it, but it seems that it will be 3%. to ensure that they get into the high school closest to where they live if they do not get one of their priorities. Now I said it for the third time, and I hope the rapporteur has heard it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170233	Thank you very much to the SF rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170243	Thank you. As has been said, we are dealing with a citizens' proposal called a free secondary school election for everyone and, as has also been explained, the bill that we have also dealt with here in the Assembly Hall was the one about how we distribute the pupils between the high schools, and the SF's rapporteur has explained very well both the rules today and how the new rules work, also in detail, so I will refrain from doing so and instead ask: what was the purpose of making the agreement? It was to guarantee young people's educational opportunities, even in the future, so that there is a choice, much like a free choice, but in fact also just a choice for some young people in the future. There are young people who, in just a few years' time, don't want local high schools without this deal. Now a great deal has also been referred to the parties, and it has been said very, very clearly on the part of the parties, that without an agreement there are no local high schools, and that in several places on the map we have black educational gaps, and that is why we have made an agreement that turns the negative spiral in which a number of high schools have ended up where they cannot attract enough pupils, both outskirts gymnasiums or high schools located in rural areas, and this applies to high schools, among others. the Western Region of Copenhagen, Odense and Aarhus. Then there has also been a criticism of the way we have done it, and I think that is quite fair. It is both fair that it comes from Christiansborg, and it is especially fair that it comes from young people and their parents who are concerned about how this will work in practice. We have listened to that criticism. We have taken out a drawing element, which none of us who are still behind the agreement really thought was particularly brilliant. It was some others who were involved in the negotiations who thought that part we have tampered with, because we recognise that it creates a arbitrariness that should not be in this agreement. Then we have also reduced transport time, which means that what the agreement does - and I think we can discuss that on the terms it is about - is to ensure that more young people go to the local high school, so that we also have local colleges and locally anchored colleges in the future. This means something for young people's educational opportunities. There has been a great deal of interest, particularly from the Left and the Conservatives and I think others too, for how the Radical Left can support such an agreement, and that is what I have tried to explain here, but to make it quite clear that for the Radical Left, the educational opportunities for young people are heartblood, and that is it in relation to all young people, and that is why, when the title of it is called a free secondary school election for everyone, I think we owe it to us to take it quite literally. Because if there is to be a choice in the future for all young people, including those who do not have a voice in this debate, including those who live in the West region, including those who live in our rural areas, then we need to have an agreement and we need to have a model. We have not heard much about what the solution is from the others. I think we have a model which, with all the difficult dilemmas now facing us, solves a problem in the least intrusive and most appropriate way. I think we owe this to politicians in charge, which is why I am very pleased with the changes we have made and the criticisms that have been made, and I am also very pleased that we still have an agreement that will guarantee young people's educational opportunities, even in the future. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170625	Thank you. There are a few brief comments. First, it's from sir. Morten Dahlin from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170629	Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. My question is actually quite short and simple. If we look at the distribution zones, i.e. in and around the larger cities, which are where the political dispute lies, how does the Radical Left have a fundamental part to play in the radical-social liberal heart about helping to cut the free school choices of very many young people?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170654	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170656	I feel that this is an agreement that is necessary for us to have high schools in the future too. That's what I said. And, as the SF rapporteur also said, I understand that when you do not deal with your first priority, you will be disappointed, but there are a great many young people who do not do so today. There have also been figures on how many people have to go somewhere else. Some of them will then have the opportunity to actually have their first priority met, so there are also some young people who have more free choice than today, and some others who do not, and it is fundamental that there should also be a free choice, a choice of education and an opportunity for young people in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170731	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170733	But the fact that there should be a more free choice in the distribution zones is basically wrong. The figures that the government has put forward, which they say are linked to enormous uncertainty, show that free choice in and around the larger cities is falling, and so I would just like to ask the rapporteur again basically: the rapporteur regards himself as a social liberal, not as a socialist, but as a social liberal; how do you feel if you are a liberal minded person; going out to say to a lot of young people in the distribution zones: the choices you make today about where to go to high school are wrong; and we are now making a model based on your parents' income, which is better than you to choose where to go to school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170812	Thank you, and here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170814	I'd feel bad about saying that. That's not what we're saying either. We say: Unfortunately, all young people cannot go exactly where they want to. Neither can they today. We need to find some rules that distribute the students, because we can't just build eight floors on top of Gefion Gymnasium. How do we make rules that ensure that there are good educational opportunities for young people, even in the future, which will benefit as much as possible? We'll do it this way. We do this by having an agreement that ensures that there are local training opportunities in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170842	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Britt Baker from the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170845	Thank you. This proposal is completely, in principle. It's about whether man comes before the system or whether the system comes before man. And the Radicals have supported this proposal that integration policy is higher on the agenda than education policy and the free choice of young people. So I just want to hear the radical rapporteur: how do the Radicals feel in their stomachs that young high school students will now think about what their parents serve and what their peers' parents serve and that they must be ranked according to what their parents and their peers' parents serve?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170933	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607170935	In the Radical Left we do not rank people according to their background, and that is why the issue is not about the system of individuals, because today too there are rules of distribution. The question is, what kind of people are you taking into account, and there we are also taking very, very great account of the people who live in outskirts, of the young people who live in the west region of Copenhagen and in the west of Aarhus, who are right now rushing into high schools and who must also have educational opportunities in the future. Now I understand that the Conservatives have been given a great veneration for this group of young people, which they do not want to impose, i.e. among other things. the bus children in Aarhus. This is, of course, a misunderstood criticism, but I am also a little surprised, because what I have heard the Conservatives suggest is that it was precisely the bilingual pupils who could have a long journey time. And that is exactly what we in the Radical Left think is not why the solution is not simply to move on to some pupils; therefore, the solution is that we get an agreement that basically ensures that there are educational opportunities for all pupils, including in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171036	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171038	I simply do not know what the rapporteur has listened to, because the Conservative People's Party has never distinguished who should be on a bus. We have never said that those in the West could sit on a bus for longer than other children, never just to make it clear, but we have questioned whether it will be better integration to bust children, and we have done so based on the studies that are based on expert opinions and on the meetings that the rapporteur himself has attended, where experts have said that this is of no use. Does the rapporteur accept this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171111	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171113	No, first of all, I do not recognise that this is how the model works. I think it has been said quite early that it is not about busting someone around, but about the students going where they live. Secondly, therefore, I do not recognise that the expert judgement should be that this would have negative consequences for young people, because that is not the content of the agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171136	Thank you to the radical rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Jakob Silverhøj from Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171149	Thank you. As has been shown in the debate over the last few hours, it has not been a simple matter to resolve the major problem of student distribution in the country's high schools. I have had the occasional mixed pleasure of taking part in the debate for the last 5-6-7 years here in the Danish Parliament, and with the agreement we reached last summer, we have, after all, only taken a first step. And now, finally, after about six years of debate, hopefully, we can put a stop in the first place, although I am sure some will say that it is only a comma in terms of ensuring a new pupil distribution. It has been our wish for a very long time that there should be changes in distribution. It has also been my impression until some time ago that there was a broad desire in the Danish Parliament to change the distribution of pupils. As far as we are concerned, we wanted to address the lack of diversity in the building schools, on the one hand, and to address the major problem in the sparsely populated parts of the country, where it was obvious that the pupil-sharing system we have today risked the closure of a number of high schools in large parts of the country. That is why we are satisfied with the agreement we have reached with the government and two other parties. We are pleased that the legislation has finally come into place. But I would also like to say that we are listening to the criticisms that are being made. Of course, we are impressed by the fact that we are relatively quickly able to collect 50,000 signatures that we are not satisfied with this agreement. It would be strange if the political parties did not listen to the problems raised. Nor do I find it strange that concern has been caused. When you change the rules, it is clear that the attention of the individual young people who ask: what is it like now with my choice of education, in order to have a place of education chosen? And with the debate that has been going on, it is no wonder that if some people can get the impression that we are now doing something completely new, where so far there has been a completely free choice of high school, we have suddenly come up with the idea that now we are totally changing the rules so that we no longer have it. But that is not the case. There has not been free secondary school choice; there is not going to be a completely free secondary school choice for everyone, but we are changing the free approach to secondary schools in such a way that we take as much account as possible of the individual pupil, but also take account of the whole. And part of the whole is to ensure that we have a diverse student composition in the high schools. I would also like to say that the Left has been freed and I have not participated in the great liberation, because I think that these discussions sometimes become so much parade and talk to television, instead of taking the substantive debate. However, there has been ample opportunity for the Left to put forward concrete proposals on this matter. I just noted when Enhedslisten tabled a resolution on a concrete model; we did so on 1 November 2018. That's where we suggested that there should be a district model. It had the advantage that one was actually sure that one was admitted to a high school close to where one lived. The Left did not want that, and there may be many reasons why you wanted something else. But what the Left and the Left Government did was, as it were, to give up. It was then that they said: yes, we do not have a proposal for this, so we are setting up a committee of experts. In addition to not supporting the concrete proposals that others had in relation to the distribution of pupils, it was allowed to sail until there was a new government, which then began to actually solve the problems together with the Enhedslisten, the Radicals and the SF. So I have to say, I think it is a little awkward when you make criticism and we ask: what then? For then the answer today is that you will go to great lengths and find a good model after a choice. I would say that we have been very thorough because we were sitting there for almost four years without providing a solution. And that is why I do not have much confidence that, apart from the fact that we do not like it here and will vote against it, we will be able to come up with a model from the Left that really solves the challenges that we have actually agreed on, namely to ensure a greater diversity in the composition of pupils in high schools. So I have full respect for the citizens who have made this proposal, but we think we have landed on a sensible model that we stand by in the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171654	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Morten Dahlin. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171657	Thank you for your speech, which was more about Left than forced distribution based on parents' income. The rapporteur is not convinced that the Left will come up with a model that really solves the challenges. Does the rapporteur seriously believe that the original agreement plus the supplementary agreement that has been concluded will actually solve the challenges that the government has been open about is the reason why this agreement is being made, namely those high schools where there is an excessive proportion of non-Western pupils? Is Enhedslisten convinced that this agreement plus the supplementary agreement really solves those challenges?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171732	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171734	I believe that we will have a much better distribution than today. I certainly believe that we will have a much better distribution. Whether it will turn out to be completely smacked, I am not sure, and we are the ones who have concluded the agreement, of course, not sure about that. That is why we have been very clear about the fact that when we have experience with the first take-up, we will go in and assess whether there is a need for adjustments. So yes, I certainly think we have found a better model, but we are also prepared to adjust it if it does not work sufficiently well according to the intention we have had.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171803	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171805	And in the assessment that Enhedslisten then says that you will do, after you have had the first take-up, as I heard the rapporteur say, can there also be that you will completely remove the element of distributing on the basis of parents' income?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171819	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171821	After all, everything is possible in principle, and since I have not concealed at any time, even today, that we had thought that a district model had been reasonable, I would say that relapses to that model will always be able to encourage the Enhedslisten's rapporteur. But I have immediately heard that it is not a proposal that has been going on earth. I have to sign to the Danish People's Party, and then they can sign to us that we have actually agreed that we could go in that direction. But obviously there is not a majority in favour of this in the Folketing, so I think we have ended up on the best possible model.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171857	Thank you very much to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Britt Baker from the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607171906	Thank you for that, President. We are standing here today because more than 50,000 people have signed the citizens' proposal to maintain free secondary school elections. There are 50,000 signatures placed on the government not to put young people in the order of precedence and to force them on the basis of what their parents earn. There are 50,000 signatures that it is fatal and heartbreaking for young people to divorce their familiar surroundings and their companions and give up their leisure activities and their leisure jobs to drive an hour and a half by bus a day. There are 50,000 signatures that young high school students should not be puzzle pieces in the social democratic compulsion community and taken hostage in a long history of failed integration. I understand why so many have signed, and I understand the popular uprising against the government's forced experiment. I would like to thank the initiators of this citizens' proposal. You guys are huge fighters. You have given the Danes the opportunity to refrain from coercion; you have given the Danes the opportunity to fight for something as fundamental as free choice; you have given hope to future high school students. And there's hope, because I can promise you one thing: as soon as there's a new government, we're gonna roll this proposal back. The proposal to forcibly distribute high school students is one of a large number of restrictive proposals from the Red Government. It shows very clearly how government policy penetrates the Danish homes and dictates how we should live our lives. And it shows very clearly how the Prime Minister of the children is only the prime minister of the children of words, but not of action. When we debate high schools, we should debate education, we should debate learning, professionalism and well-being. I still find it hard to understand that a debate on high schools is now about ranking students according to the size of their parents' payroll. I still find it difficult to understand that you will take well-functioning young people hostage based on parents' income and require them to correct a failure of integration, especially because this is important expert after expert and study after study has shown that it doesn't work. A study from Aarhus shows that forced distribution results in poorer professionalism, loneliness and dissatisfaction. Several experts say that this will create more stigma, worse learning and worse well-being. Nevertheless, the Red Parties in this Parliament insist that this is done to promote integration. After two years of corona, the prime minister of the children should put well-being and mental health above an uncertain forced experiment to correct a biased distribution that has led to problems in very few high schools. In the Conservative People's Party, we say a resounding and huge 'no' to coercion and we say a huge 'yes' to strengthening free elections. We believe that consideration for the young person, who is at risk of massive distrust due to forced distribution, weighs much more heavily than consideration for a social democratic excelarch. The problems of the few should not be forced among the many. This proposal is in principle. It's about whether the system comes before man or whether man comes before the system. It is so simple about the limits of politics, and for us conservatives the limit has been exceeded when parties here at Christiansborg want to determine the relationship between people. For what is it reasonable that a young person under the age of 20 should pay the price of failed integration? As a Conservative, I will continue to fight fiercely against the forced distribution of all kinds, whether we speak of high schools or primary school, where the government also dreams of having forced distribution. It's so wild and disgusting a thought. And it is also a wild thought that the Radical Left supports this agreement. Dear Radical Left, you usually say that you pay tribute to free choice, that you are the young people's party, the educational party; you can't say that anymore. Dear government, dear parties behind this agreement, you still have away the opportunity to listen to the experts, to reason, to the more than 50,000 Danes behind the citizens' proposal and to the many young people who stood out here a few hours ago in front of the Palace Square and said no to coercion. You have the opportunity to stop your forced experiment and back up the free choice. Listen to the citizens' proposal and to the brave young people who have clearly resigned at today's demonstration. Do as they write in the proposal here: Drop the new rules on the forced distribution of Danish high school students.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172454	Thank you. The first brief remark is to Mrs Astrid Carøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172457	Thank you. The Conservatives will abolish this new agreement on student distribution when we come to an election. Will you then have the same model as we have today?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172509	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172511	We will be listening to the experts who have been promoting and proposing different models, contrary to the author. And when it comes to cities, we will provide a higher taximeter grant to those high schools where there are many resourceless pupils. That is something the experts have recommended. We will also look into the possibility of extending the very popular high schools so that we can have more places admitted and even more have their first priority met. And when it comes to rural areas, it is true that for the next 8-10 years we have small years of pupils. That is why we have also said that instead of spending 200 million. kr. on bother and bureaucracy and an IT system, we would much rather support those colleges in the province, which are challenged by a low student population with a higher taximeter grant, so we keep them running for the next 8-10 years, where there are challenges with a low student intake. So we have solutions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172612	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172613	Okay, so you'll use the advice the experts have given in connection with that study, I think that's done, as we've had a debate about, and as Conservatives before we made this deal, after all, poured down the board; so both the district model and the cluster model wouldn't be part of it. So I don't see how to distribute students in any other way than you do today, i.e. by distance, unless it's by grades. And we can't get an answer to that. I think that's weird. I would also like to ask whether the rapporteur is aware that it is 3% that are not meeting one of its priorities today and that they risk having to travel 60 minutes; with the new agreement it is 45 minutes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172647	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172649	I think the rapporteur should try to explain the 3%. to the students in Vallensbæk or Dragør or Taastrup, because there it is not 3 per cent. It is quite possible that it is 3%. On average, but it is not for the individual student; it is not for the student who is being held hostage here. So to answer the rapporteur's first question, I would actually very much like to stand here and point out our solutions: a higher taximeter subsidy. And no, we're not going to rank high school for grades. We're going to motivate instead of forcing the students to places.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172727	Thank you. The next question is Mr. Jens Joel, the Social Democrats.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172731	We agree, and we have at least for some time also agreed with the Conservative People's Party that we had a challenge with some of the crooked high schools, what has been called ghetto high schools. That is why my question is actually whether the Conservative rapporteur agrees with the Conservative President when he said in this Chamber: close them down.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172759	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172800	Yeah. The President has said that if there are major cultural challenges, social coercion, then the last resort could be to close them down. That doesn't mean we have to close 13 high schools or 15 high schools • those high schools where there are major challenges. This means that there may be 2 or 3 high schools where you cannot correct social control and where the students will not comply with the Danish culture, and then you will have to step in and close them, but I would like to stress that this is not being abused on Twitter or in other echo chambers that it is the last resort of allerallers. Our solution is that we listen to experts and that instead of trying to improve professionalism, we try to make it attractive in those high schools.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172845	Sir. Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172847	I understood that the first answer was to add more money to the high schools at risk. If you close a high school, where are the students going?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172901	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172902	Yeah, well, they're going to other high schools around. Then you go and try to get them out to other high schools quietly. There aren't really any other options, sir. Jens Joel, if you choose to close a high school. That's why we say it's the last resort, but you can have a place where there's such bad culture and so much social compulsion that it's never gonna succeed, and then we don't just have to accept it. I do not recognise that the model you are driving in here works; I do not recognise that, nor do the researchers. We have a problem, but the solution you've thrown on this table doesn't work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172940	Thank you. The fact that we don't use direct indictment applies both in singular and plural. The next question is Mrs. Anne Sophie Callesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607172948	Thank you. I really appreciate that the Conservatives are now telling us what their bid to solve this is. These are some of the issues we have known for a number of years now, and so I really want to ask: have the Conservatives made proposals on some of these things in the past? Is that something you've been working on? Or I could also ask more openly: in what way has it been sought to solve the problems of what I do not know whether it was perhaps more the expression of the Left that could be called ghetto high school, or at least a skewed student composition and closed high schools?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173023	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173025	This is something we have been working on along the way, and it is something we will be working on much more if we regain government power, because then we will roll this model back, and then we will use some of the proposals that I mentioned just now, namely to motivate high schools, increase professionalism and support with more funds, so that instead of imposing benefits we support the weak pupils who are out there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173049	Mrs. Anne Sophie Callesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173051	Okay, so at least that's something you want to focus on in the future, I heard a little was the answer to what you've done so far. In this context, I would like to ask: do the Conservatives believe that it is important that there is also a high school for young people in the West in the future, how will this be ensured by the solutions that are being proposed, and we recognise that many of them have been tried in a very large number of places, but unfortunately they have not been able to crack this code and the negative spiral in which many schools end up?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173122	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173124	At any rate, efforts have not been made to provide more funds, by strengthening professional skills and by making it more attractive to be a high school in the West. This has been done with tighter supervision. More stringent supervision has been exercised in these places which have not been able to combat the social control that was there. Of course we're going to have high schools in the West, but we have to make them attractive. We have to motivate people to seek them. We don't have to force people by bus 45 minutes each way to a high school. Nothing will come of that, and there will be no good integration at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173200	Sir. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173203	Thank you to the rapporteur for an excellent speech, I think. It was the SF's question about the 3% that made me take the floor. Will the rapporteur not confirm that they there 3%, SF runs around like a magic number, in fact is just a little talking magic, because you ask students to make more choices than today, and then you can say: See, you got one of your priorities. This will reduce the number of people who, at least on paper, do not enter a high school they have wanted. Will the rapporteur confirm this, and thus that what the SF is running around with is not compatible with reality?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173232	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173233	Thank you, sir. Morten Dahlin for the rose thank you, and thank you for an excellent question. I would like to confirm that the figure of 3% that the rapporteur for the SF is touring around with is by no means holding water.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173247	Sir. Morten Dahlin
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173248	Thank you to the rapporteur for confirming that. And then just one last question which actually also raises some of what the rapporteur and I have discussed both with the Radical Left and with the SF. In the Radical Left and the SF, there is no concern that this will lead to increasing dissatisfaction. I would just like to know if the Conservative People's Party shares the concern of the Radical Left and the SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173312	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173314	There is no doubt that if you take a handful of students in a class force them away from home from friends, interests, local environments, then it will create distrust. It shouldn't have been rocked science, and I actually think that on a good day you will be able to make the Radical Left realize that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173334	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to Mrs Britt Baker. Then the next rapporteur from the Danish People's Party is Mr. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173343	Thank you. The citizens' proposal, B 202, expresses the wish to drop the new rules on the distribution of pupils in the large cities, as required by the agreement on the distribution of secondary schools and presented in L 157, which we have also debated here earlier today. The Danish People's Party has previously been part of the agreement, but has recently left the contract circle and is therefore outside the agreement. The Danish People's Party is a great supporter of the agreement, which deals with rural gymnasiums, because it provides an economic foundation for secondary schools outside the major cities. The part dealing with the distribution of pupils in large cities is no longer eligible for support because the scheme has proved too bureaucratic, too arbitrary for pupils and because it creates a great deal of uncertainty for pupils. That is why we support the intention behind this motion for a resolution, not understood as a totally free choice, and not because there is a distribution, but because the uncertainty and opacity have simply become too great in relation to the gains that may be made by the model that has been presented. That is why we support the intention behind the citizens' proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173454	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173458	I think it is a pity that the Danish People's Party has abandoned this agreement, even without trying to improve it first. And if you really want to continue to be behind the part that is about rural areas, it is to secure money, the rapporteur says. Yes, but it is by making sure that there are enough pupils who, by the way, are also what the high schools want. Not only do they want money, they also want to have some students in the rooms. How does that method differ from the fact that you want to do exactly the same in cities, in other words to ensure that there are enough pupils to ensure that high schools are sustainable? And why can the Danish People's Party no longer support that part of the agreement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173538	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173539	Well, we've been worried all along about that model and construction with an algorithm that was supposed to control it inside the big cities. As Enhedslisten's rapporteur, we would have liked to have seen a district model both in one place and another, because that was, from our point of view, a good way of resolving it. Then there was no chance of getting through with it. But we have a very strong focus on the fact that the high schools around the country have a huge need for the elements of this agreement. That is why I am expressing myself alone on that part of it. That is also why there was an amendment earlier today to split up the proposal so that we could actually support the part that we would like to continue to support.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173628	Mrs. Anne Sophie Callesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173629	Thank you for your answer. It may not have been quite an answer, but just to address something else, I would like to thank you for confirming that you still have politics in the Danish People's Party about what you want to have a district model. I really think it's liberating to say that. So just for that around the algorithm, I just want to stress that it is a computer that distributes according to the rules we adopt; and just as we today distribute according to distance, there will then be a computer that distributes according to the new rules. So it's not an algorithm that lives its own life. But thank you for your answer. And thank you for exposing the Danish People's Party to what their policy is in this area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173706	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173708	Yes, and then I would say that in relation to the algorithm, there is, of course, the fact that it seems to me to be at least extremely opaque and unpredictable what the results of it will be. It has also been part of the debate that it will be until it is brought in. Therefore, exactly that part of it creates very, very great uncertainty around.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173728	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment from Mr. Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173732	Not least in these times we talk a lot about algorithms because social media and all sorts of other uses algorithms. But here it isn't an algorithm that like has a learning, a preference, get to know you, takes you somewhere, does something. It's just a help. You could say that you could do exactly the same thing by hand, but the problem is that it would take a lot of weeks and months and years to sit and do all those calculations. So it's more correct to call it a calculator than an algorithm. I have also heard Horten and some others ask whether this is really artificial intelligence. But it's not, it's a calculator. Anyway, I would just like to sign off on the fact that the Danish People's Party actually says that a district model could also have solved the problem, because I agree that one could have done so. This is a little contrary to the discussion we are having right now, when the Left believes that there is free choice for some in the cities, but not free choice for them in rural areas and such. But a district model would solve the challenge, and that would minimize the free choice, and that is why it was chosen from, but it is certainly a solution that could be used to deal with the problems.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173843	Thank you. Then it is the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173845	This has been our policy for a long time, and this is the way we think we should go. In relation to the calculator, I would say that it is not artificial intelligence in that way, so you should not be afraid of it in that way. But what has been the challenge is that it has not been possible to get the calculator to say quite exactly what is actually going to happen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173905	Sir. Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173909	The reason why there is uncertainty about the calculations is, of course, that it is difficult to know how young people will seek. Today it is the case that if you do not seek your nearest high school, where you have a front pocket, because that is what gives the front pockets today, you have a risk of getting far behind in the queue. So today there are a lot of people who are not looking for their real first priority, and how would they have put themselves in the new model? Of course, it's hard to know when you run the calculator on the old numbers. So it is true that there is uncertainty, but points to recognise that it is not artificial intelligence and something that has its own life, it is really just an aid to the distribution that is going on no matter what.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173946	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173949	It can be said that it is helpful, but it really creates a huge, huge insecurity, and that is really what we want to address.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607173957	Thank you. There will then be no further brief comments, so thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. Then the New Citizens' rapporteur is Mrs Mette Thiesen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607174003	Thank you so much. We have been standing here sometimes discussing forced distribution, and as I described it the last time we stood here, this is basically about values, and we are at a crossroads. And the last time I was here talking about forced distribution, I described it as being able to choose two paths. One should close one's eyes, one should imagine that one is standing at this crossroads, and on the one hand there's this dark forest there's a little spooky, there's thorny shrubs, there's dark trees, and on the other hand the sun, the birds sang, and there were green fields, yellow fields, etc., as far as the eye went. That's basically what this is all about, which way to go. For us in the New Citizens' Party, it is actually quite simple, because do you choose the path that I mentioned to the left, which the government and the supporting parties have put, into the dark forest, with more coercion and less free choice, or do you choose the bourgeois road, that road with more freedom, sunshine from above, more free choice? Of course New Citizen chooses the last. In New Citizens we want more freedom, we want more free choice, and that is why, of course, we do not want Danish high school students to be used as cones in an integration game, that they should be sacrificed on the altar for this misguided immigration policy. That is what we believe today, and we have meant it from the start. At the heart of the matter is that in future high schools will have to take up pupils on the basis of their parents' purses, the fulfilment of young people's educational desires will be conditional on what jobs their parents have. This is the exact opposite of what the government claims to want to achieve, and it is also exactly the opposite of what we want in New Citizens, namely to ensure free elections. In short, high schools should not be used as integration projects, pupils should not be forced to go to a high school without their friends or far from their place of residence, and therefore it is of course a bottom-up task for a future bourgeois government to set out to scrape this red-collar piece of a high school agreement, because it is no use just moving around the problems, they have to be solved from scratch. In New Citizens we have, as the only party from the outset, said no to forced distribution. It should not be mistaken what the purpose of this agreement is: it is the forced distribution of pupils in the name of integration, and the parties to the agreement also address this agreement as an attempt to mix the pupils on the basis of their parents' income in order to create a more socially diverse composition in the country's secondary schools. So from now on Danish students cannot be sure whether they are placed in a poor high school with a large proportion of non-western pupils, and that is really unacceptable, because the bill for decades of failed immigration policy cannot and must not land in the teenage room, it simply must not happen. And the obvious way to avoid this state forced distribution is, of course, that parents go together to set up private colleges to ensure free choice for their children and for our other children and young people, but even here the government and the blood-red support parties are sticking their long fingers into civil society's initiatives and restricting freedom, because in future there will be a ceiling on how many pupils private high schools can take up. It is, of course, because the parties to the agreement know very well that no young people want to be forced into a high school. So we owe the young people much better than what we owe them a really free choice, also as to which high schools they want to go to, and that is why I started my speech by saying and will end my speech by saying: we are at a crossroads. What do you choose? If you choose that path with more freedom and more free choice, or you choose the opposite, less freedom, less free choice. Which way do you go on the path? In New Citizens we are in no doubt at all. Of course, as a bourgeois party, we choose more freedom and more free elections, and that is why we naturally say no to coercion and a great 'yes' to free elections. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607174440	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you to Mrs Mette Thiesen. There are no more rapporteurs, I see, to speak. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Children's and Education. Are there any comments? It's agreed. The next item is a debate on questions, and that is where we need to get the rapporteurs up here first. So it's possible to stretch your legs for a few minutes until we get people in place.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607175029	I would point out that the vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until Wednesday 8 June 2022. The first to speak is Mrs Lotte Rod for a reason for the question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607175059	Thank you. The school needs to be felt. The children in Denmark must attend a school of imagination and enthusiasm, where creativity and knowledge are allowed to go hand in hand. We have to make up for the fact that too many students are forced to open the computer and log in to a portal and solve one identical task after another, hour after hour. More and more teaching material is centrally purchased through digital services. It is bad because good and motivating teaching requires a variety of materials, methods and approaches. The teacher's ability to plan his teaching and choose different teaching methods is weakened when the municipalities have chosen in advance what learning means are made available. Many of the materials are even goal-driven to a degree that binds how they can be used, and this makes the teaching boring for the students and for the teachers. Of course, many talented teachers will be able to be creative with and overcome the bindings of the portals, but there is a risk that a prefabricated model will be too much driven down over a lot of teaching. Therefore, I would like to quote H. K., who was a teacher in Næstved, but who is unfortunately not here anymore, who wrote here two years ago: "If it is not didactic and educational considerations which become the basis for the purchase of teaching materials, but instead supply and quantity discounts, then the primary school loses the proud Grundtvig principle of light learning, because teachers no longer have the freedom and expertise to organise individual courses targeted at individual classes and pupils. In several places, the cost of digital learning tools is so high and locked that there is only limited affordability for physical materials. That is why I am asking today: what can the government say about materials at school, including books, paints, wood, etc., as well as what importance digital platforms have for it, and how will the government promote that students' everyday life in school is characterised by imagination and enthusiasm, including in materials?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607175312	I would like to thank the rapporteur for his explanatory statement. And then it is the Minister for Children and Education for an answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607175323	Thank you. And thank you to Mrs Lotte Rod and the Radical Left, who have asked the government to explain how things stand with materials at school and what importance the digital platforms have for it. In addition, questions are asked about how the government will encourage students' everyday life in school to be characterised by imagination and enthusiasm, including through the materials. The government believes it is important when we discuss materials in the teaching, that the educational considerations are the most important and that it provides a room for action to take the decisions that are appropriate to the individual school, in the individual class and for the individual pupils, and that therefore this is not something that we as such decide centrally from. I do not really hear the rapporteur say that either, but I think we should stay very far from getting involved in this. And that is why I see this as a slightly freer discussion about how school is doing, more than it is a question of some having a desire to start dictating how to choose teaching materials at school. In fact, within the framework of legislation and the overall priorities of the municipal council, the school management is responsible for the quality of education and the organisation of education. The school board makes principles for the school's activities and approves the school's teaching materials, and I wouldn't want to change that. Teachers select within this framework, which means that it is in practice the teachers themselves who choose the material they think best to support the teaching they carry out. It is a professional choice, it is an educational choice, and it is a choice that the teacher makes every day and I do not think that should change. So we have to be careful when we, as politicians, move into debating this. Well, with that warning light on, I would say that, in this context, it is also the case that the Ministry of Education does not systematically collect knowledge of what materials and teaching resources teachers choose to use in schools, including what resources are allocated to it. And that's because we haven't got the time, and it's a very conscious choice... a centrally fixed curriculum. We don't standardize our teaching. There are, and there should be, very different materials, so if we want to reflect, if we want to be critical, if we want to be imaginative, effective and everything else, then we as politicians must stay a long way from interfering with these things, if you ask me. But if we look at the part that has been done in the study of the teachers' digital everyday life, the study shows that the majority of teachers and managers believe that there is an appropriate balance between analogue and digital resources. I mean, when something new comes up, everyone gets completely renovated, and we have to do everything possible, and then at some point it finds such a little more natural rent. I am very fond of the digital world, but you will have to be careful about what the iPad can do, not to forget that there is also a physical book and not to have it thrown out with the bath water. And I've been quite concerned the times I've heard about places where you've taken all the physical books and just drove them to the recycling site or where you've drove them, because studies point to that understanding of texts is better when reading on paper than when reading on screen, and that analogue reading benefits everyone in their development of reading skills and is important for particularly weak readers. As with everything else, practice champions, and anyone who has children who have gone to football or other leisure activities also knows that if children lose their appetite, it is uphill with leisure activities, and if our children are to be good readers, yes, it actually requires them to want to do so. And studies show that the desire to read has fallen over time. I think that is worth noticing, and that is something we should be very concerned about. Many schools and educational institutions replace books and analog texts with digital texts and digital teaching portals, and characteristic of the digital texts is that they are often shorter than analog texts, and that readers of digital texts are more often distracted during reading, i.e. don't get that immersion and that reading flow you'd otherwise get. When reading shorter digital texts, there is an increased risk of diversion, which is why students simply do not get sufficient training and do not get automated reading skills. When I remember my childhood's great reading experiences, the books dominate my memories to a large extent because they allow me to live in completely new worlds, and this disappearing completely in books and worlds, I think, is really important for you to be able to read, but also for you to simply like it. This thing about being interrupted in your reading experience, I think maybe it's one of the worst things I can imagine myself, i.e. that you're not allowed to get into that flow where you've been delved all the way into another world. Of course, IT and digital resources are part of the modern everyday life of all schools, just as it is everywhere else in society. It must be, and I am proud that we are one of the societies that has come to terms with it for a long time, but it is the educational considerations that must govern the choice of materials and not the digital options. It is important that all actors around the school are aware of this and when I say around the school, it is of course because it is not always the individual teacher who decides whether to use books or digital learning means. And I think we have to be very firm that it is the educational concern that has to govern this. With the latest announcement of the primary school's educational learning centres, it has been made clear that the teaching centres should help teachers to choose both analogue and digital teaching means and to support teachers in developing working methods that promote experience, immersion and enterprise. I would like teachers to have a palette of opportunities to choose the teaching tools that best support learners' learning and motivation, and we know that limiting choice in relation to digital learning is something that is really seen as a restriction in some places and, incidentally, as a challenge. The government will therefore engage in dialogue with publishers and other relevant actors in relation to how the pedagogical considerations behind the choice and procurement of digital learning tools can be strengthened. One of the things I think we won over the coronate was to try it out in a new way. Teachers should be able to use the digital and analogue learning tools that they consider most appropriate to ensure the highest possible learning outcomes of pupils, including both materials and teaching aids that promote their entrepreneurial spirit and imagination. I do not think that we have hit it straight in relation to the learning platforms that are today, and that is why the government would like to take the initiative to look at how we can move forward with some of the experiences we had during corona, where we opened up the entire digital library for teachers, instead of having access only to what the municipality had bought access to. Then I think there's a final angle to this, but I think it's quite important to bring it. There I don't have all kinds of fresh studies to take up a hat, but I can just say that for parents of children in primary school it's incredibly hard to keep up with when everything is digital. There's an old-fashioned math book that you can keep up. You can see both what is going to happen in the coming months and the coming year by browsing through the book, just as you can see backwards what the student has been through. There is the digital universe from time to time incredibly incalculable, and you lose that feeling of being able to sit at the table with each other around the books. So my guess would be that in relation to the parents of children in primary school who are going to help with homework and want to know what's going on, that digital universe is relatively incalculable. And that is where I think we have simply lost something that we need to find a way to recreate. I do not have the answer to that, but I think it is one of the things we should also discuss with each other in relation to how we achieve a better balance between the digital and the analogue. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180151	Thank you. One brief comment is now available to the rapporteurs, and the first one to sign up is Mrs Gitte Willumsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180156	Thank you for that and thank you for a good speech, Minister. I very much agree with the remarks made by the Minister about the learning that is being done in the digital and analogue learning tools. The minister said a little about trying to give better access to some of the digital learning tools. There are at least some concerns I have about them, and I know them relatively well, and that is one of the learning views, but of course you have to work with that in the individual schools when you have to choose digital learning tools. But what does the Minister think we can do to clarify what the analogue book can do? 'Cause I'm afraid there's a lot of people thinking it's a thing of the past. But how can we make the analog book modern again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180250	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180252	I think that part of it is to multiply some of the results that are around it, because I believe that there were some decades when it was very blinded by this that we need all sorts of digitally, and it has been a huge advantage under corona. So everything comes with a front and a back. However, I think that one was just as well blinded, and that is to say that one might have neglected or simply did not have research results yet on how the analogue works in relation to the digital. I have seen a very easy exposure, for example. I think that is not insignificant, too, with regard to the parental perspective. After all, we know from research that, regardless of the social and educational background of parents, parents play a very important role in their children's school day, and that means that we lose too much of both the fact that we are not immersed in the digital and that parents cannot help in the same way, we are dealing with something that we have to take quite seriously. So I think that is a discussion that we need to have on the basis of the research results that have been achieved.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180351	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180353	Thank you for a very good speech, and thank you for being so clear about the importance of it being teachers who choose their teaching material. I would therefore just like to ask the Minister what the Minister is going to do about this, so that this is not just the case in theory, but that teachers actually have the opportunity to choose, in other words that, as HK and other teachers have described it, it is not the large-scale agreements and the supply contracts which define what kind of learning means they have access to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180421	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180423	First of all, I'd like to encourage the schools to drop the stuff about throwing the books out. Because it is a really, really bad idea, considering some of the research results that are in relation to the balance between the analogue and the digital. Because the books can't be recreated, or they can, but then it costs a lot of money you don't have. So I would say in relation to this with the platforms that some of what we experienced in the coronatiden and that's why I want us to make contact with the publishers and talk to them about how we can seize this idea. In fact, we bought access to all platforms for all teachers, simply because we were in the situation that everyone suddenly had to teach digitally because it was online teaching from home. And one of the things we took care of was to open up all these platforms, and that meant that the teacher suddenly got access to all digital libraries instead of what the municipality had purchased on their scale, and that gave another freedom, which is much better in line with the Danish teaching tradition, where, even at the time it was analog, one has had access to the libraries that allowed access to all materials. And that is the way I think we should simply keep open, that is to say, look at how we can make it more permanent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180533	Thank you. Then it's mr. Stén Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180535	Thank you. And thank you to the Minister for the speech. I am pleased that we state that schools are the responsibility and task of the municipalities and that there is also the freedom in classrooms to choose to do the things you want to do. I am also glad that we do not measure and weigh on what happens in the classroom in this respect. I have had some doubts about what we should be talking about today, and now we are talking a lot about technology versus books, but there is also something called sløjd og hjemskab, which could also help to awaken some interests in the little child, as it did with me.The Minister will be hearing about that in a moment's time so there are also some clues that could make the young people more interested, curious and perhaps also critical about some of what is going on. Can the Minister also reflect a little on that? Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180628	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180630	At least I can, and now I speak freely from the liver, because I am not in charge of the economy of the municipalities. However, if I were to sit in a municipal council, I would put a lot of emphasis on the fact that, for example, in the individual schools. in connection with food knowledge, advice was given to make more than oatmeal. Materials matter, and it does so especially in the subjects that are material-borne • it almost gives itself • as for example. Slothe, food knowledge, visual arts, whatever it is. There is simply no meaningful education if there is no access to materials. I have an experience of and often hear it from parents that that part of the teaching has been downgraded, and if I sat in a municipal council and looked out at the municipal schools, I would put emphasis on it. One of the areas where we lag most in Denmark is, in fact, the practical teaching. Children too much sit in the books during a school day, and fortunately life consists of incredible much more about it, and it is a huge discussion that we have taken many times, but in this way I think we share the view. And it is clear that it matters whether a municipal council spends the money one way or the other.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180738	Thank you, Minister. There's no more short remarks in this round. We shall now proceed to the debate and to the general rules for short remarks, and the first to speak is the rapporteur for the questioners, Mrs Lotte Rod. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607180754	As I also started by saying, children in Denmark must go to a school characterized by imagination and enthusiasm, and where creativity and knowledge are allowed to go hand in hand. Today, it is unfortunately the case that many students leave primary school without being able to read, write or count or with very little desire to embark on the opportunities offered by the subjects. At the same time, many children and young people are disillusioned and find that the school is meaningless and they are gradually losing confidence in their own opportunities. That is why we have an important task in building better and more rewarding educational communities where students can have experiences that they remember for the rest of their lives and where they can feel that they are significant participants in the common practice at school, so we simply need to revive teaching at school. Good teaching can't just be done from a recipe. This requires teachers to have time to develop it, both alone and with colleagues, and it does not matter whether the teaching is digital or analog. The instruction must be adapted to the individual student and the class. When teaching methods provide recipes for teaching, there are a number of important choices in relation to what is emphasized in a subject. There is a risk that the focus will be too much on measurable and narrow skills. It also sounded as if it was some of what Conservatives were preoccupied with while the larger educational purposes are forgotten. The teacher is the key to ensuring that education and the purpose of the course are developed in the best way and in such a way that the pupils' horizons are expanded and that they also want to throw themselves at what they do not yet understand. It is therefore a self-evident point that not all teaching should be based on didacting teaching aids, where it is given in advance what to do. Teachers and educators must have the opportunity to develop exciting and present teaching in learning aids where there is not yet a recipe for what they are to be used for. After all, it may be about using a news report to learn more about the world or to visit the recycling site to gain a better understanding of how we consume and what can be recycled, or it may be about building models at school to gain a new understanding of the mathematics profession or by purchasing materials that invite creative expression. The school should be a place where students can test and play and co-create what we are not yet able to set targets for, and students should be allowed to forget that they are learning and, by virtue of it, perhaps even learning the most and best. I believe that it will require a shorter school day so that there will be better time for schools, for the educational reflection and development of teaching and for coaching, where the pupils will be more involved in how the teaching should look. At the same time, I believe that the school must be freed from target management in the so-called common goals, which narrow the teaching towards what can be measured, and then I believe that the school must decide for itself what materials they want to buy. And if you read a little further in what the teacher I mentioned before has written, he writes like this, and I quote: 10-15 years ago, the work took place in selecting learning material in professional teams, where we tried various things off and made a common attitude to the school management about what we wanted to get purchased. With the digital revolution, which began for approx. five years ago, this method was replaced by common municipal solutions where large purchase agreements were given priority over teachers' methodological freedom. At the same time, as teachers' teaching time was increased, many of us were forced to turn down the individually organized course - in favour of a standardized meter product. ▪ I believe that there must be room to do theatre and literature courses and studies in nature, where everything is not broken up in modules and goals that have been devised in advance, but where the students can suddenly experience that they can do more than they thought, and where the teachers and educators want to stay at school because it becomes fun and meaningful to teach. Research into creativity at school has pointed out that teachers must be able to reduce control and allow pupils to participate, and that too clear an emphasis on what was called the right answer pedagogy is not the solution. This does not mean that there are no correct answers, but the desire to reach them is about creating a high-quality educational environment. So if we are to succeed in this, we need to think new and put emphasis on something other than we have done in recent years. I believe that we need to turn down the goal and portal teaching and up the imagination and creative materials. And then, on behalf of the Radical Left, the Social Democratic Party, the Left, the SF, the Enhedslisten and the Conservatives, I would like to make the following: Proposals for adoption • Children in Denmark must attend a school of high professional competence and well-being • a school where enterprise, imagination, creativity and customer-creation go hand in hand. We have an important task in building up giving educational communities where all students can have good experiences that they remember for the rest of their lives. This presupposes that schools have the freedom to choose materials and the corresponding method of using them. Not all teaching should be based on didacting teaching aids, where it is given in advance what to do. Basically, the choices must be made locally, and we trust that our skilled professionals are precisely the right ones to choose relevant materials, including which digital platforms they want to use and to what extent. • V 101).
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181323	Thank you. The proposal for adoption will be included in the further debate. There are no brief comments. Thank you to Mrs Lotte Rod. The next rapporteur is from the Social Democratic Party. Here you go, sir. Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181342	Thank you for that, and thank you to the authors for raising this debate, which is, in fact, entering into some of the discussions we are having in the field of school right now. It is a discussion about greater freedom locally, a greater confidence in the discernment and opportunities of professionals and more space to actually influence the teaching, but of course also a discussion about greater diversity in school, both in terms of materials and learning styles and in fact also subjects. I think it is very wise for us to have a fundamental discussion here in the Parliament, too, because when we have the talk with the teachers out there, when we have the discussion about how we get more practical subjects, when we have the discussion about how we get IT used in a way where IT provides some extra learning and not just become such that, as the Minister said, you read the book on the iPad and understand it a little worse, we have to discuss in some way how we use different materials at school and create a diversity both in school day and in materials. I think the important thing for the Social Democratic Party, and of course the Minister has covered that too, is that we are using this discussion to stress where there is a need to give more elbow space, where there is a need to actually give more space to diversity and to the professional out there and a little less to decide from in here what is the good school and how it should be arranged, or what it is, there are the good materials. We are also behind the adoption text that the radical rapporteur has just read out, but I would really just like to reaffirm and emphasise that we think it is part of both a freedom agenda, a diversity agenda, an agenda for a varied school day and to get all talents into play. And if teachers are to make all the students and all the talents in the class blossom, the teachers must also have all the tools in the drawer that the teacher might seem to be educationally useful, and therefore of course also a width in the materials. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181612	Thank you. There is a brief comment to Mrs Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181614	Thanks for the speech. I very much agree with the Social Democrats that this is part of our debate on freedom. I also think that this is actually part of the discussion on professionalism. Because if we want there to be different materials, that you can actually build, that you actually have access inside classrooms to things that are not just on paper or on a computer, then it does mean that there is actually the freedom in schools to have diversity and materials. I would just like to ask: what will the Social Democrats actually do to ensure that teachers actually have the freedom to choose different materials?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181648	Sir. Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181649	Well, there's some of the stuff that's about materials. There is also something about professionalism and practical subjects, which I usually say are two sides of the same coin, but still two different things. Mathematics can be used as a support in relation to a biblical understanding, as didactic principle, but slopes can also be a craftsmanship in themselves. So we do not just need a variety of materials, we also need more workshops. Therefore, it can be said that the discussion we are raising here is a matter of ensuring that some of the decisions about what is to be made of materials come closer to the individual head of the school, to the individual teacher, at the very end, but it is also a matter of course that from here we have to carry out the task, for example. Now we sit and have a longer discussion in connection with the school together on how to get more practical subjects into the primary school. I think that is extremely important, and we have been dealing with this for a very long time. I think that really matters. But there we also have to provide a financial framework so that we can actually get the tools and workshops that would make it possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181801	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you, sir. Jens Joel, and the next rapporteur is from the Left, Mr. Stén Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607181809	Thank you, and thank you to the Radical Left, for raising the question here to the Minister, in relation to the speech and the lines that the Minister lays in relation to the freedom that must also be in the municipalities. I am thinking that we in the Left, like the rest of the Folketing and the rapporteurs here, want capable, formed and educated children from primary school, where the potential of each child is also fully challenged, that they are curious and that they are critical, and that is a huge task for educators and teachers. In the Left, of course, we also see different learning platforms as the way for children to be developed towards being critical, curious, formed and trained, including materials and digital platforms, and perhaps not surprising for this rapporteur too. In the middle of the time I went to primary school, I met both sledgehammers and food knowledge, and I almost remember it as it was yesterday, because it aroused a huge interest in me, both this with sledgehammers, the various materials, and what one could do with these things, and just as with food knowledge the first few times, and it was not only oatmeal, minister we made at my school, it was also meatballs and all sorts of other exciting things, but it was also sport that caught me so much. So with the differences that lay in it, I think, when I went to school, also more practically oriented primary school, it caught me at least and made me curious about both my youth about my further life, and I think that somehow we also have to go back to that, and that is something that we, as the previous rapporteur also said, are discussing in the co-operation of the school, where we are, after all, visiting different schools, which have more practically oriented subjects, or which have at least managed to bring it into the primary school, so that the young people also meet the different things that could make them curious. For all young people, they are very different, they are unique and they are caught in some different ways. To return to what the Minister also said, and which is also important for the Left, it is, of course, that there is the freedom in the individual school and in the individual municipality to be able to bring to the roads the materials and platforms that must enable us to capture the young people so that they are just formed, educated, curious and critical of the life that may come. And, of course, we have helped shape the text of the adoption and can fully support it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182106	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182109	Thank you for that and thank you for a fine speech, and I just want to follow up with: Will the Left help to look at the barriers that stand in the way of teachers actually having the freedom to choose their own materials?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182121	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182121-2	Yes, then the questioner should try to draw up the challenges that the questioner thinks there are. Then I'll try to get it a little closer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182132	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182133	I'd like that. For some of the things the teachers point out are that in the municipalities where such a large part of the budget has been tied up to purchase certain platforms, there is not really anything left in the school that the teachers themselves have something to do with, and then the individual learner does not experience any freedom. For then you are bound to the portal teaching that is, and then you cannot actually be allowed to unfold what you want, simply because you do not have the money for it yourself. That is why I would like to ask the Left whether you will help to see that teachers actually have that freedom, and not just on paper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182206	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182207	Always and willingly, but also in the fine balance sheets that the Minister has just mentioned, that is, that we from the Parliament's platform should not dictate, but at any rate enter into dialogue, and I would like to do so both with KL and with the parties that are in the school together if there was a discussion.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182227	Thank you. There are no more brief comments, so thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. Then it is the rapporteur of the Socialist People's Party. Here you go, Mrs. Charlotte Broman Mølbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182254	Thank you for that and thank you for the floor. In fact, I think this debate is important at several different levels. It acts among other things. on how children will have better opportunities to unfold their imagination in school day, and on what importance digital platforms have for it. I also think it is important that we have a debate on how to achieve a society with the imagination at its heart. I think that I and the authors of this question are on the same side when I say that we are both too more play, more creativity, imagination and enthusiasm. And I think that we are heading in the right direction to get more imagination into schools, and that is because teachers, with small steps, are more able to exercise their skills and gain more freedom in school for that. The fantasy of school blossoms when we give teachers and staff teachers in schools a freedom to organise teaching and school day and put their professionalism at risk. Then the commitment, both of the teachers and indeed of the students, increases. And that makes them, and also teachers, able to provide more motivating teaching, which brings the students professionally and personally, what we do, among other things. could hear the previous speaker also refer to. But we also need the means to enable schools to buy the materials that create imagination and enterprise. We know that it is a well-known fact in schools that the economy can be difficult when you are faced with a great many children who may need special education, and when you also have the ordinary running of the school. Then there may be pressure on the materials, so there is also an economy that is involved here. And even though Minecraft can digitally enhance the ability to work together, creativity and imagination, it is equally important that schools can afford the students to also try to mix paint and create new colours and teach the students sustainable cooking. But we also need a general cultural change in our primary school. As I said before, it is so small on the way, a change in culture which also says that it is quite okay to fail, that it is actually quite natural, because if we do not allow mistakes, we will also kill our imagination, and then you get nervous and insecure, and then you dare not let it go. If you can't be allowed to unfold your imagination in primary school, we'll probably have an imaginary society. And there SF would have liked us to have gone further with shorter school days and character-free classes, also because feedback for us is more than just a small number, you put on a performance, but also is about what it really is you've been through. What have I learned, what has been done well? However, we are pleased that we have succeeded in abolishing the educational preparation assessment itself. In fact, we believe that this is one of the things that can give more freedom to pupils, because all pupils are ready for something at their own pace. That is why the SF also believes that we must continue the good tactics we are doing by giving schools more freedom. It is useful, and it also provides something when schools are allowed to convert, among other things. the supporting training for shorter school days and with more adults in the hours. For then there is also more time and space for this game and freedom to evolve and what can now arise when you give it away. And with those words, I have presented the SF's attitude and attitude on this, and we thank you for putting the subject on today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182630	Thank you. There are no brief comments. Thank you to the SF rapporteur. Then it is the rapporteur of the Enhedslisten, Mr. Jakob Silver Mound. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607182646	Thank you to the questioner and to the Minister for the statement. I was thinking, when I was preparing, that I wonder what direction this discussion is going to take. I also thought that this is probably a problem that has filled too little in our discussions about the school at times, and that is no wonder, because there is a lot that has filled: school reform, teachers' working time rules, and what do I know? However, I do think that the debate is important, and I think that, as we are discussing it in the field of vocational education, it is important that there be modern equipment in order for vocational schools to be able to appear as modern educational institutions, I also believe that teaching aids, materials actually have a major importance if we are to help make primary schools a more attractive choice for parents. It can be a little difficult to have an overview of how things really stand. Nor do I believe that the questioner had expected the Minister to be able to explain in detail what was in the depots; at least I did not expect it. And you have to be careful about making policy on the basis of individual stories, even if, if you knock on Google a little, there are all sorts of textbooks that hang on lasers and so on. But it doesn't really make us smarter than there is a single teacher or two or ten who have had bad experiences. On the other hand, if you look at learning platforms, it knocks out a little more. At any rate, I remember how I looked it up when we had a debate about digitalization in the primary school.I think, by the way, or I know it's a few years back, and that's why the figures are a little out of date, but there was an inventory from 2012 to 2017 that showed that 2.5 billion had been spent. kr on it in primary school just during the 5-year period. That's a lot of money, and I'm sure some billions can be added. At any rate, there is something in the debate that suggests that we have a problem with a staggering amount of money being spent on teaching materials, which may not always be used equally well. In this respect, I can be concerned about who is really running this thing. I'm not so worried that it's the local timber store that controls the purchase when you work with wood in primary school. It's probably going too, and it's wise to act locally, so you shouldn't transport that far and something like that. However, some of the criticism that has been of IT and digital learning tools has been that it can be highly guided by large tech giants, so that what can really guide development is who is doing business in this area. Therefore, the teachers' desire is to have an influence on the teaching materials, that is to say to have an experience that it is one's own didactic considerations, which are not quite alone, because the school must buy in common but at least the didactic considerations of the College of Teachers, which are crucial. It can then be overshadowed by a purchasing policy. The questioner, Mrs Lotte Rod, also mentioned it herself, and it can be said that the damage may be limited in relation to procurement policy in some areas; in others, millions, even billions of kroner, can really be invested without sufficient thought out how they are used. So that's kind of the aspect I chose to dive into, because I think there are a lot of relevant aspects, but I think it's incredibly important that we think about all the physical teaching materials such as wood and paint, and what has been said about how we get better management on the use of digital learning tools and IT in primary school. A government that is understood in the sense that it should not take place here by the Folketing, but that it should be laid out locally. How do we actually ensure that you can handle these giant purchases at all, which you have to have at school together? How can one actually create greater real freedom for teachers' colleges at the individual school, so that they are not simply dictated in their choice of the supply that exists from large companies? So there is clearly a task that we should also be immersed in as one of the many aspects that might be related to the question raised by Mrs Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607183154	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you to the Enhedslisten rapporteur. Then it is the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go, Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607183210	Thank you and thank Mrs Lotte Rod for having called this question today. I would say that the debate has taken a slightly different direction than I expected when I left home. Today we are discussing F 34, which is about what the government can disclose about materials in primary school, specifically about wood, paint and books. It is a question debate in which a number of committee questions could have been asked in order to find out some things. What exactly does it look like in the country in this area? But there isn't really any background material in this kind of debate. This means that it can become a series of sights. What do we think of wood in primary school • how much does it take? Or what do you think of paint, and is it now being used in the right way? And I can have a lot of views about it because six months ago I myself was part of the primary school teacher team in the whole country and was teaching daily. And I can tell you that schools are infinitely different, so it's probably hard to give a clear answer. First of all, in the Conservative People's Party, we think that the overall point is that there are options to choose. Nor do we think that this is something that the Minister for Children and Education should be able to account for, that is, what you have in the local schools. Until I arrived here in the Danish Parliament a year ago, as I said, I was a teacher, and I would now say that what we are debating today is one of the things the school is dealing with, both at management level and in the individual teams. Alternatively, it could be something on which the municipal council had an opinion on a good day. We ourselves have now not spent much gunpowder on material selection in Silkeborg City Council, where I am a council member. However, we have great faith in the Conservative People's Party in terms of the freedom of method, and it does of course mean that we must give teachers the opportunity to have a real choice. And teachers do not always have that in relation to digital learning platforms. It is dictated from above which one should use, and when one goes in and looks at the learning view underlying some of them, one would never have bought that book if it had been printed. It can be a monkey jumping up and down with a banana, or a ball being thrown into the air, or a cake that gets an extra light when you've made something right. I think that's long gone in the Danish primary school. We would really like there to be free opportunities to use different teaching materials and that there is a lot available at EMU, so that teachers can be inspired and have an exciting and varied teaching done for students out in primary school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607183512	Thank you. There are no brief comments. Thank you to the Conservative rapporteur. Then it is the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. Here you go, sir. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607183524	Thank you. And thank you to the Radical Left for bringing up this theme, because it's really, really important. We are talking about freedom for schools out there, and that is something I fully agree with. At the same time, I can also see that if you are sitting in a municipality and having to make the budget last, you may have a tendency to buy some big package. And then it is the one you have, and then it is the one they have to adjust to out there, at least in the digital field. So I think there are two discussions in this. One is about how we motivate people to actually use the good old-fashioned books and also to ensure that in sløjd I know it's not called slød anymore, but it was once called food knowledge and the other subjects where you use physical elements in the teaching, actually have some good materials there. So it's on one side. On the other hand, with regard to digital, of course, we need to use it. And the Minister himself referred to the coronatide, where one of the handles was to give free access to everything that was on the digital market. Because there are two things in it. One is, of course, how to motivate those who make the digital teaching materials to actually make them good enough to do what they have to do and to compete with the books. At the same time, however, there is also the question of how we can make agreements. I hear the Minister suggesting that you will contact the publishers in relation to looking at it. I know it has been discussed in the past too, but we have not really come all the way to the ramp with it. But there really is a need to have a serious discussion about it, and the ideal thing was if you could get back to the situation that was earlier, where you could say in a teacher's college: this textbook is the one we would like to use at our school, and then we will buy it from one publisher, and tomorrow we will find something else from another publisher. And as the third thing, we do something ourselves. If you could look at any of the same things in the digital field, I actually think there could be some perspectives in it. So you can say that one thing is to give total freedom out there; another is to ensure that that freedom is not used to cut down in a way that does not give us any teaching that works. I think we should have more discussion on that. One thing you could suggest was an expert hearing or something else that could give us some more knowledge in this area, some more action on what we could do. I could see some possibilities in that. But otherwise we will just have to take the debate, I was just about to say, and also push the Minister, so that something will actually happen. And hopefully this debate will also contribute to that. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607183810	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party and then we have reached the Minister for Children and Education.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607183828	Thank you. There was just an incredible lack of different parties, and the Danish People's Party tends to be at a different time in the order, so I have to get this into the intuition. It might sound like an evil thing to say, but it wasn't meant that way. First of all, I would like to say that I very much agree with what the rapporteur of the Left said up here while I was just chewing a sandwich over in the grip. I think it is incredibly important to hold on to this with materials that have been set aside for the discussion here today, that you get your curiosity aroused, and for the Left rapporteur it was about sport and food knowledge, and for myself it was also sloppy teaching, so to try to build Denmark's wildest soapbox car, and that is something that you just always remember. Think of how many school hours you have that you can't remember, and then there are some school hours that you can really remember, and I think it's very true that there are some different things that bite at us and that the variation in what we get to bite at is extremely important. I also think that the point that came out was that Enhedslisten had it in relation to the statement of how much money has been spent on teaching materials, in fact it was exactly what I noticed during the coronatide. For I had thought that my prejudice attributed that, when we suddenly found out that everyone now had to teach online, it would cost some sort of exorbitant amount if we were to give access to all platforms, i.e. open all the digital libraries to all teachers. Yes, it did not, and it was even in a situation where we had 2.02 minutes to negotiate a solution home to, and yet it was actually a clear framework that we talked about, and that certainly makes me curious. One thing is that the municipalities think they have a big business, but if they have a big business, then we have even more big business, which means that perhaps it was really a question that, if you screwed up the agreements a little differently and saw it at a national level, you could give access to it all, and that is what I think is our role as politicians. This is not interfering with what the individual teacher is doing, but it is actually removing barriers and increasing the possibility that there is as much freedom as possible for teachers in assessing what they are doing in the classroom, and one of the ways to go would be to look at how we can continue with some of the good bars from coronatide. Then I have changed and I can hear that is the same all around about a concern about whether you are skipping the physical books for the benefit of the digital, and that there has to be a balance in it, and I am extremely glad that, as I am listening to it, we really have a very common foundation in relation to it, that we are very fond of the digital, and that it is good that we have come this far, but we must also be careful not to overdo it, and that balance was perhaps not found with the first decade of digital learning in the primary school. So all in all, I think that it has been a very good debate that we have had here during this debate and that it is also very good that we can find a joint text for adoption. I would like to say that I myself think that perhaps the most important next step in this debate is the discussion with the publishers, which we will take the initiative on the part of the government, and the whole discussion on practical subjects and practice and application orientation, because that is at least both the business and the curiosity and all the other things we want with the primary school. So thank you for the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184156	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184159	I just want to end by saying thank you very much for that and that I really think we're moving in a really good place too. Because I think the lesson from previous years has been that we should, like, stop thinking that we should regulate and indulge in all sorts of things. On the other hand, we need to be clearer about the direction and values and also about what kind of framework it is and what kind of barriers we have to remove, and I think that if there is something we have done in this debate, it has really been sending out a clear signal. Although we have spoken from each of our parties, I think that the signal to the teachers out there must be that it gives a backlash to those who have experienced a situation where they did not have the freedom of choice and that we have at least helped to push for that to be the direction we want. And then I just look forward very much to continuing with what the Minister is handing out to here to take the next step together. Because I think it means a lot that there is a diversity of materials in relation to what it is to a creativity and enterprise that is at school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184251	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184252	I do not know how much more I have to say than thank you for that, and thank you for the initiative for the debate. I think it has been a very good debate, and I think it is an important topic, and I think it has gone a lot of people who are not around the school in the everyday nose past, that teachers have gone from having a situation where they themselves worked with what it is for materials to be used, and then to a situation where too many of the teachers say that you have to do platform teaching and you can almost hear the sighing in their voice when they use the word "and it doesn't work." This is not the way to go with our primary school, and I am really glad that we agree with each other on that. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184325	Thank you to the Minister for Children and Education. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. The vote on the proposal for adoption will take place on Wednesday 8 June 2022, as I said earlier.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184343	I would point out that the vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until Wednesday 8 June 2022. The first to speak is Mrs Lotte Rod, who, as rapporteur for the questioners, is responsible for justifying the question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184405	Thank you. The most important thing for children in crèches and kindergartens is the interaction between children and adults. Children need sweet and fun adults who are present and are absorbed in something with their children. It is important that there are enough staff so that it is possible to be with the children in small groups at all, but it is equally important that the staff are trained. The president of BUPL, Elisa Rimpler, wrote like this back in March: "The pedagogue is a bomb under the government's child policy ambitions. The Prime Minister will have to respond to the pedagogic shortage... This requires an economic boost of the pedagogic education and a national plan for recruitment and retention of pedagogics. I agree. We are facing a lack of 13,700 educators in 2030 just with the existing standards, and it will only get worse if we actually increase the demands on how many educated educators we want. That is why I am asking you today: what will the government do to promote the recruitment and retention of educators in this year's agreement with the municipalities, including among others. through cooperation on credit training, pedagogy intro for assistants, full-time positions, senior and combination positions between institution and pedagogy training?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184523	Thank you for the explanatory statement. Then it is the ministers, and I see that the first minister is the Minister for Children and Education. Here you go for a reply.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607184533	Thank you. And thank you for the floor. Well, of course I don't want to go in and comment directly on this year's agreement with the municipalities, because the negotiations are going on right now. That would be really bad style, so of course I don't. But that is why I would like to thank the Radicals for raising this important issue. It would probably be better if the parliamentary year had, as it were, been paralleled, so that we had come on the other side of an EA agreement, after all. It would have given a little better opportunity to discuss this openly. There is no doubt that recruitment to vacant educational positions in the daily offers for many municipalities is a major challenge. For example: a study from the Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment shows that approximately one in three teaching positions in Religion Capital in 2021 have not been filled or have been occupied by an employee who did not have the required qualifications. The government agreed in last year's financial agreement with KL to follow the development of the proportion of trained educational staff in daily offers across the municipalities, and the latest available data from 2020 show that the proportion of teaching assistants is at the same level as in 2019 • approx. 5% at national level and that the proportion of educators has fallen by about 2 percentage points from 56 per cent. 54 per cent. So developments are not going the right way, and this is a challenge on which we in the government are concerned to find solutions. However, I have heard from some of those who are concerned with the teaching assistant training and with the paus in everyday life that there has been a drastic fall in unemployment among the paus, so that they have, as it were, been sucked in. And that means that if we now had new figures, they would probably if the people are right about what they are saying, and I think they have shown that the boil has actually been broken with regard to hiring paus in the municipalities. And that's really, really good. However, one of the solutions is, in the opinion of the government, in the amount of money that we set aside in relation to the day institutions. So when we, together with the Radical Left, the SF and the Enhedslisten, have phased in legal requirements for minimum standards, from 2024 onwards there will be 1.8 billion. kr. extra each year. It is a fun thing to say that putting extra money off for extra colleagues should solve something on the recruitment front, but when it is still our conviction, it is because it will, of course, contribute to the satisfaction of the work you do, that there are actually enough adults. And that is why it will be my claim that it will help to maintain educators in the profession and, moreover, educators and pausians that there is a great deal more money set aside for the area. In other words, in relation to such a continuous retention of staff and recruitment, it does of course matter what kind of workplace you come in to if it is a workplace where you always have a feeling of necking afterwards and solving the task unsatisfactory. I've heard of a lot of educators who have gone home with stomach ache because they didn't think there was enough time for the children. I believe that more people are being shot away from the area, whereas I believe that the fact that there are actually resources, that there is time and that there are enough staff is helping to maintain that. So even if it may sound quite the opposite, that more money is being set aside for more staff, but that it helps with the recruitment problem, it will actually be my claim. Then, too, with the agreement on minimum standards, we have set aside 100 million so far. kr. in 2023 and 185 million. kr. in 2024 and up to an upgrading pool. And that is because we have a desire not only to maintain the level of trained staff in relation to the fact that there will be more money for the area we actually also want it to increase. And it is not least at the request of the Radical Left that that money has been put off in the negotiations. And we have the hope that we can get the country the final agreement around before the end of this year, but that requires the rest of the agreement to be settled as well. However, the upgrading pool is intended to cover training costs and temporary employment cover related to upgrading. Experienced pedagogic assistants can thus be trained as teaching assistants or merit teachers while still employed in the institution. I am convinced that this will help to increase the level of education and, with the same logic as I mentioned earlier, I think it will also contribute to maintaining it. And then I would like to highlight the teaching assistant training as an essential part of the solution to the current recruitment challenges in this area. I see a very great potential in the recruitment of even more educational assistants in this area. It may be a very good place to go for those who do not see themselves in the pedagogic education but who want to work as trained staff in the field. We from the Ministry of Education have just published an evaluation of the programme, and it shows that the students are very satisfied with the programme and that both students and graduates experience that the programme gives them relevant pedagogical skills and equips them for the educational labour market. At the same time, management managers and colleagues of the teaching assistants in the evaluation state that they are experiencing a positive development in the professional level of the newly trained teaching assistants. And that means that all in all we are really starting to deal with the paus, which we all probably wanted to do, but where it has not really succeeded or at least the unemployment rate has been a little too high among the educated paus. So it's starting to look like something. Against this background, of course, I also hope that it will be such a ketchup effect; that one gets used to having paus employed and in this way makes greater use of them, because their professionalism can help to create quality in daily offers, both for the benefit of the children, but also in terms of contributing to the current recruitment challenges. And I want to say one thing just because I love that story. It is Kasper Palm, who sits in Danish Metal in the field of education, who tells him and he often does, because I always tell him to do it about the preferred training for a blacksmith who would like to make a change of track. And then he's gonna have to ask like that in the blue, what do you think it is? Top 1 is then to become a teacher. So the first choice for a blacksmith to make a switch is to become a teacher. Sometimes we have such prejudices about what each other does and what we want. If we have this as our first choice, what would we have as our second choice? And you know what, I love the idea that there are some more blacksmiths who come out and will be educators if they no longer want to be blacksmiths. And I would like us to create educational paths and channels so that you can make those switches throughout your life in a way that people find on some shelves that may give them a completely different life than the one they had imagined at the age of 16. And fortunately for that, because life is long. So that's one of the stories I really like. And it doesn't matter that we get a little bit broken with the gender-separated labour market too, and that some more men enter the day institutions. And it was then a prejudice about who is primarily a blacksmith. It then holds water in return, for it is primarily men who are. So welcome aboard for those who have chosen that path. I would like to say that I note that there are major municipal differences in the proportion of full-time and part-time employment; there are really large differences. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Housing's Benchmarking Unit, by the way, has a terrible name, but they have to mess with it over there, showing that 60%. part-time work is carried out by educators and teaching assistants at national level. And it has so much variation down in the stomach. But there may be a lot of years to do in that some people choose to go into working hours and I know that there are a lot of people working to create good conditions and opportunities for it, but it is important to focus on maintaining the employees who are already out there. And I think one of the reasons why many people have chosen to go down in time is that it has simply been too hard. And that is why I think that when we talk about this with what it means, when we suddenly spend as much extra money on the daily offers as we do with the agreement on minimum ratings, that one of the things it means is that the desire to go up in time will be significantly greater if the work you can deliver is not so hard at least that you should not run quite as fast and that there is actually time to deliver proper educational solutions. A crucial element, then, is that, as a whole, we obviously have attractive training courses, attractive training routes, and my colleague from the Ministry of Education and Research, Mr. Jesper Petersen, get on with it in a minute. So I just want to say thank you for the floor and thank you for being able to take this debate in the first place.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185422	Thank you. There are a few brief comments. There is room for one brief remark from each of the rapporteurs. The first is Mrs. Lotte Rod. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185429	Thank you for your speech, and thank you for the incredibly fine story about the blacksmiths. Perhaps I should start by saying that I actually put this question to the Minister for Finance, who then forwarded it to you two. If you now come and say that you cannot say anything about the economic agreement, then I would just like to say that this is an argument for the next time the Finance Minister will have to appear himself. Then I can use today's speaking time to ask the Minister some of what she can do, and I fully agree that everything that costs money is a matter of financial law, and of course we do not take that in a round like this. Nevertheless, I would like to ask about what does not cost money, but which is about the influence of the government, together with the municipalities, to be able to set things in motion, in other words by simply engaging in things, working together on things, spreading models for which the Minister himself speaks. So what will the government do to promote the models that are already around and that can ensure that more assistants already in the institutions train themselves as educators?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185527	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185529	I would say that having the Minister of Finance in the Assembly would not have helped much, because it is he who is sitting and negotiating, and neither of us can go into what is going on at a negotiating table, whether it is the Minister of Finance or whether it is my colleague, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Jesper Petersen and me. So you could say that compared to that, it wouldn't make any sense. On the other hand, it would have made a great deal of sense to take this debate on the other side of the economic agreement. That is why my answer will also be that because negotiations are being held right now and because this is one of the things that is being negotiated, it is very difficult for me to stand here and say something about what the government is going to do and not to do together with the municipalities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185609	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Charlotte Broman Mølbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185618	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. I'm a proud educator. I'm proud of my class. I am proud of the education I have taken and what many of my former colleagues have also been through. But one of the things that many of us have missed is real recognition of the education that educating education actually is, and what it provides and creates of skills out there. The minister said something about the paus. In fact, I think it makes very good sense for us to get more of the teaching assistants into the day institutions. But I also get a little worried about whether the Minister sees this here as having to pauus, the teaching assistants, to replace the educators out there. Because that would seem to me to be a slippery slope of the other world and a real downgrade of the professionalism that is needed around the children, precisely to create this security and evolving everyday life when the children are in day care for so many hours. Then there is the last part, namely that I would like to hear a little more specific about what the Minister thinks we can do to get more educators to stay in the profession.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185721	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185723	Just to put it incredibly clearly: No, I don't imagine that. Then it's not really anymore. Just end. Then there's the thing about how we get more people to stay in the trade. I think that all sorts of minor measures can be taken. There you would always be able to point to all sorts of small screws you could put on and do all kinds of things about. I'm always sensitive to it. But I think that if you really have to do something about it, it's about giving enough money. That is why I am mentioning the agreement on minimum standards, because it is the biggest single investment item we have made, well beyond Arnepensionen, during this government period, that is to say it is in the children. There's the big structural blade like that. What's it like to turn a ship around? Well then, we can talk about all sorts of small things, but what really moves something is that the educators have an experience that, when they go to work, it is satisfactory because they get used to their profession and actually can unfold their professionalism, because there is time and space for it, and so that one should not run from Herod to Pilate without achieving anything, that is, that it is simply not so hard. Because I believe that it contributes to the fact that a great many people choose to go part-time, otherwise they simply cannot stand to do so. So if we want to do something about it, there is one way, and that is a lot more money. That is why it is one of the results I am most proud of during this parliamentary term, namely that we have managed to get so much extra money to the day-care sector. There's been a need for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185845	Thank you to the Minister for Children and Education. There are no more brief comments. The next minister is the Minister for Education and Research. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607185855	Thank you. I shall try, for my part, to supplement the excellent contribution made by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Education, a moment ago, as far as my area of responsibility is concerned. I, too, would like to thank the Radicals for the question and for the opportunity to discuss this matter, which concerns the question of how we ensure enough educators for our day care institutions, and various secondary discussions thereof, which I can of course hear from the questions we also address. The solutions need to be found across many areas and I do not think there are any snapshot solutions. It acts among other things. on the search for training courses, the transition to the labour market and the retention of several educational professionals in the profession. The Minister for Children and Education has addressed several of the relevant themes in his speech, including the minimum standards agreement, the upgrading pool and a possible potential for more educators to work full-time. I will spend my time talking about ensuring strong and attractive education in the educational field, which can attract enough students. In my optics it also means, hopefully, that we will be more skilled than we are doing with the education that is now, to actually carry out the profession in practice, and that more will be within the teaching profession. The first point I would like to highlight is the merit education which I believe can be an important contribution to getting new groups trained to work as educators. The academic education course offers opportunities for people with different educational and vocational backgrounds to train themselves as educators. We have already done a great deal to make credit education even more attractive. As part of the minimum standards agreement which, after all, is being discussed again today, it became, among other things, part of the agreement. agreed to reduce the admission requirement for credit teacher training from 5 to 2 years of professional experience in order to make it easier to upgrade already employed employees and give them a shorter way to take this training and become trained educators. At the same time, the Ministry of Education and Research has launched experiments with a special organisation of credit education aimed at people who already have higher education. It may be academics who find it difficult to find work where they have been trained or who would like to change track, hence the so-called switch model, as it is called. Here are offered among others. unemployed academics a tailor-made course with paid work next to the study. The model can make it easier to saddle up and be trained as a teacher, and this makes the way shorter for those who want to do so, so get into the profession and make the difference for children and young people, which is what lies in the profession. The track change model already runs in Copenhagen, and this spring we in the Ministry of Education and Research have approved that Aarhus and Odense can also start up. I think it was this morning that my newsletter from the Region of Southern Denmark said that an agreement has now been made with UCL on how it should be done and that it can therefore be offered in, among other things. Odense, so that more and more places in the country can access this offer. We can see that there has been a large increase in admission to credit education this year. In fact, it is about doubling the number of people admitted from last year to this year; approx. 350 last year to approx. 700 this year, and that is, of course, very positive. It is also in the light of the fact that we have seen a decline over a number of years in the number of people seeking education compared to the general education. It is still the largest education, but unfortunately there is a fall in the number of people seeking it. Here another important element of the discussion is, of course, on my part to ensure a strong and attractive education and, at the same time, to make up for the notion that everyone can look after children. That's not true. We must have better education and give the profession the recognition and prestige it deserves, also as a contribution to recruiting the talented and committed educators of the future. We're in full swing. The government has given an extraordinary boost to the pedagogy training of 170 million. kr. In August 2019, my predecessor at the post I dispute now gave an extra boost of 127.5 million. kr. to the education and training of educators. In addition, an additional 43 million has been set aside. kr. to improve the quality of the pedagogy training in 2023. An ambitious evaluation of the teaching programme has also been carried out a few months ago, which gives us knowledge of how the training is strengthened professionally and becomes more attractive, how we can make it better, and also how we can make the teachers of the future better when they meet the new everyday life in their subjects when they are finished as trained educators. In contrast to teacher training, which was provided for in last year's Finance Act, there is currently no funding. funding for a major change in the education and training system. However, the results of the evaluation seem to me to provide a good basis for having political discussions and finding different progress and solutions together. I sense that there is a broad political interest in doing so. I would also like to say that, with regard to today's debate and several of those we have had, with the participation of the rapporteurs who are here, and also with those who are involved in educating in my field, it seems to me that there is simply a heightened interest in the educational professions, in their recognition and in their importance. This is reflected in the political discussion. It also does so in the priorities that have taken place so far during this period of government, and I think that today's debate is another good example of this, i.e. that it is not a subject or an element of our welfare society that we are skating a little lightly over, but that there is, in fact, a great interest in doing these things even better for the benefit of our children and young people. I would also very much like to contribute to this as Minister for the part of education for which I am responsible. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190558	Thank you, Minister. One brief comment is now available for the rapporteurs, and that is first Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190605	Thanks for the speech. I fully agree that it is really good that so many more people are now taking a credit course. I am dreaming even more, because if we look at the figures for how many educators we lack, we have to get into an even higher gear, and I would like it to be so quite common that in all day care institutions there was a helper who was training for educators, so that all places take on responsibility for education. That is why I would like to ask the Minister: what will the Minister or what will the government actually do in order to promote that there will be many more people in the future who will take a credit-educating course?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190642	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190645	First of all, I think it is important to repeat, even for those who may follow and have an interest in the subject here, but do not work there now, that we have previously reduced the admission requirement for credit education in order simply to make it easier to take it, just as we are doing the tests on the model of switching, which is now becoming available in several parts of the country, and hopefully in those parts of the country where it has not been before, as more often will experience the situation, as Mrs Lotte Rod describes, that there are some trained staff in the institutions, either educators or educational assistants, and some who are in the process of raising their professional skills or even being trained as educators through some of these opportunities. As I said, we have taken some initiatives now. Should there be other rules or barriers preventing the use of credit education, I would like to help see whether we can do even more. We must not compromise on the quality of education, which is why there are also limits to how much we can relax the requirements for access to these other routes into the teaching profession. Finally, of course, it is also a local task. If you want to ensure a high quality in your municipality's day care institutions, that is something that needs to be emphasised and prioritised, and there are several good municipal examples of this where we are said to have young people working as assistants here, and they need to be trained, that we want to keep them, but we want to help them for the training.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190812	The next brief remark is to Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190816	Thank you. One of the things that I heard the Minister refer to in his speech is that there have been certain criticisms of the current educational education and very clear recommendations on how to do it better. And when we look at the big falls year by year in the number of young people, or they need not only to be young, but new students who want to read on to educators, it actually looks more and more frightening. As Mrs Lotte Rod said just now, we will need even more educators in the future, and I regard the education of teachers as one of the keys to creating more educators and perhaps also some educators who are a little more robust for the labour market. So I would like to hear the Minister's reflections on that, and in fact it is perhaps also a silent plea that we can soon get started with some real negotiations on it, because there is certainly a need for it. Another question may be on a slightly more general level, but that is what the government's plan really is for recruitment, because the longer we wait, the longer we come behind, and the more we will lack educators and hands out in the day institutions and so many other places. So what's the government's recruitment plan? And I actually imagine it's going to be inter-ministerial too. It may be that the Minister can say a little about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190938	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607190940	It was a whole series of things, but all relevant, from Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk. I think that the first points about training and the evaluation that are made very clearly show some of what we are going to be working on with regard to teacher training, i.e. that the quality of internship periods and the link between internship and theoretical instruction should be better. Counselling and feedback along the way are some of the things that are also highlighted and that you actually get the benefit of the internship that you need so that you are then ready to practice the subject in everyday life. I tried to mention it with the concepts in my speech, but these are some of the same things I mean and which I have tried to elaborate a little here now. I would very much like to get on with that work. As I said, I think that the evaluation provides us with a good basis for showing and saying where it is that we need to make some improvements. With the involvement of relevant organisations, both municipalities, BUPL and others, we would like to continue with this process. It is also the case, as I mentioned in my introduction, that we need funding here. We have no money left to make the same short way to reform or improve training as for teacher training, where money has been set aside for last year's Finance Act. But I hear that there is still a great deal of interest in this, and hopefully it will succeed. Higher quality, making education more attractive and improving working conditions through better standards, as the Minister for Children and Education mentioned, are some of the things that need to be done to attract people and make them stay in the profession.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607191128	Thank you, Minister. There were brief comments, and that is why I tried to say that it was within one minute, but that is the end of generosity, because now we are going to debate and that is that it is the general rules for short remarks that apply. Welcome to the rapporteur of the questioners, Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607191149	Thank you, President. Underneath it all is a ticking bomb. There are more and more day care institutions that are already experiencing a desperate shortage of educators, and in crèches and kindergartens in the metropolitan area it is no longer unusual for living rooms without permanent trained educators. The pedagogic shortage is not only a capital phenomenon in December alone, there were 4,400 unsuccessful attempts to recruit educators at national level, and this corresponds to the fact that barely one in three vacant pedagogic posts could not be filled. So says the chairman of BUPL, Elisa Rimpler. And so it is already only about half of the teaching staff in our day care institutions who have a pedagogy education, and if you add that until 2030 there will probably be 50,000 more children in crèche and kindergarten, then it means that we will need 14,000 extra educators just to keep up with the number of children and live up to the law on minimum standards. At the same time, the search for education has fallen by 25%. Since 2014, there are 11,000 educators working outside the profession today. I therefore believe that the burning platform is to be seen, and it can be added that a report from the Danish Evaluation Institute shows that the lack of educators particularly affects the children most in need of them, namely children with diagnoses and children in vulnerable positions. In the Radical Left, we will not just settle for minimum standards. We want proper standards and educators with a high level of professional judgment. And I do not believe that we can succeed in getting enough educators just with the ordinary pedagogy education. I believe that we need to create many ways to become a teacher, even later in life, and that we need to invest much more in educating many of the skilled assistants who are already in our institutions. I also do not believe that there will be many more educators alone by talking about the importance of the educators. I think we should put action behind words. I believe that we must take responsibility for recruiting and maintaining educators. During this parliamentary year I have worked with some of the sharp heads from the institutions, professional colleges and municipalities, and there are of course some of the solutions that cost money, and I know that this is financial legislation, and we have also started this with our agreement on minimum standards. But then there are also things that do not necessarily cost money, at least not from us here, but which require, first and foremost, joint commitment. This is why I would like the government and the municipalities to use the financial agreement of the year to: (a) work together to make credit training, where helpers can train themselves as educators, while working in our day nurseries and kindergarten; (b) look at a pedagogy intro for helpers, where they come to the pedagogy study for a few days, so that they get a professional insight, while at the same time they get the chance to sniff out the training; (c) look at more full-time positions, so that many more educators get the opportunity to work full-time, but also so that the children have actually trained educators throughout the day, also in the morning and afternoon; (d) look at senior schemes will give good meaning where experienced educators are given the opportunity to become a little longer in the labour market; and (e) that one could have combined positions where skilled educators could work some days on the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the nursery and open up to the children. I believe that we need a plan to recruit and maintain educators and that we need it now. Therefore, on behalf of the Radical Left, I would like to read out the following text of adoption: Proposals for adoption • Children must have skilled educators and enough of them. But in many places it is difficult to find enough educators. This leads several municipalities to try to attract educators with bonus etc. This makes sense in the individual municipality, but the Danish Parliament is concerned about the geographical distortion. It is not acceptable that there are not enough educators in places where there are most children in vulnerable positions. The Folketing wants us to take joint responsibility across institutions, educational establishments, municipalities and Parliament. Continuing training requires funding, but there is also a wide range of measures that can be taken with joint commitment. The Danish Parliament would therefore like the government and the municipalities to promote the recruitment and retention of educators in this year's financial agreement, including among others. through cooperation on credit training, pedagogy intro for assistants, full-time positions, senior schemes and combination positions between institution and pedagogy education. V 102).
ParlaMint-DK_20220607191651	Thank you to the rapporteur. The proposal for adoption will be included in the further negotiations. There is no wish for short remarks to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Social Democratic Party, and that is Mr. Jens Joel. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607191714	Thank you for that, President. There is no doubt that competent, loving, capable adults are one of the most valuable things for our young people when they go to day care institutions, and it is perhaps rather ungrateful to be the third social democrat on the stage, because it is a little difficult to say something that has not been said, but as one minister said, it is certainly not the case that everyone can look after children. My sister can, and that's not because she's about to have one, because she has to, but it's also because she's a proud and talented educator, and I'm really happy about that, and I also want to say that I'm really happy that when I deliver my kids in northern Aarhus, I meet some adults who can obviously inspire, develop and take care of my children, and who, moreover, sometimes, even though they are my children, teach me some tricks about how to actually see and recognise how to develop, which you can take home in your luggage and use. And in this way we can learn from each other, but first of all I am glad that every day there are talented adults around my children in the hours when I myself spend my gunpowder at work. So there is no doubt that it is crucial that we have more educators, more educators, because it is of course also important to have the teaching assistants in the picture, but that when we turn up the number of adults around our children and young people, we also have an ambition that we turn up the proportion of educated, competent adults. And it is not to say that a teacher assistant cannot be very good, because I have also seen my young people very fond of some of the teachers' assistants, but I think I very much agree with what several other rapporteurs have said about the teachers' assistants who actually have a very good experience and who have been in it for some years, namely whether we should also give them a theoretical backpack. Should they not have the opportunity to take an educational assistant training or, for that matter, a credit teacher? I think we can get a lot out of that. But what's it gonna take? Now it is distributed in several resorts, and I can just talk about it all like that, but I think we have to screw all the screws at the same time, and I think the first important part is that discussion about resources. Why do you want to be a teacher? It is because you want to be something for some children, and if you experience that you cannot, because you cannot deliver every day what was really intended, brought up, what you have been trained for, then of course you lose the pleasure of working. This affects the working environment and therefore it is important to create a framework. As the Minister for Education said, although it may sound counterintuitive, it is of course a long-term part of the recruitment challenge that, in order to resolve the recruitment challenge, more money is made available. There should simply be a feeling that it is not just a political priority, but that there are also enough colleagues to actually succeed in what you have to do. That is why the minimum standards agreement is very important, which is why I am rather sorry that we have not reached an agreement for what we have called the welfare law, namely to ensure that when there are more children and more elderly people, the money must also keep up, but at least it is important that there is an opportunity to recruit more people. Then there are courses, which must be of good quality. It has been talked about by the Minister of Education and which must be throughout the country. It must be the case that it is accessible, even in the countryside, not in every corner of the street, because it goes beyond quality, but as far as one can go, to ensure that the young people who seek education also have the opportunity to take it, even if they live a little outside the larger cities. There are others who have mentioned it as an important tool. I think we can only say that too little. But I also believe that this should be the last thing we need to discuss some of the educators who already exist, but who are currently either not working in the subject or on full time in the subject, and there Mrs Lotte Rod has mentioned these things about that senior, combination positions could be something one could address. I myself was at the Children and Young People's Summit in Aalborg here recently and where there was a day care manager who told about how in their municipality they had increased the proportion of full-time educators by doing longer working days. And that may sound a little paradoxical, but they had simply said that they could get more people to have full time by having 3 days a week from 1 p.m. Seven to seven, one day a week from 7:00 a.m. 7-14.30, and then you had a day off. And in fact it had been done that some had agreed to go into time because they got a weekly freedom and somehow felt that they got a better work-life balance. Then, of course, they had some long guards sometimes, and that would have meant that the same educator was present throughout the opening hours. So there was a ropekeeper who had both been there when the children were handed in and through the activities, and also when the children were picked up again to talk to the parents about what had gone well and badly, and they had actually seen this as a qualitative improvement in their working day. And it is not something that is forced, but if you can get it to be connected with your other privacy and when you have to pick up your own kids, then it has actually given you an opportunity for more people to go full-time, and some of those discussions you have to have out locally and make sure that you actually turn every stone in order to get all those who are in the field, all those who are skilled, to stay there, to go up in time, and then, of course, we have to make sure that there are some more who come in through the front door. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192313	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment. I have just forgotten that I have to read out a proposal for adoption here). It's okay. It's beyond the speaking time then.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192324	I'm sorry. It is a proposal for adoption on behalf of the Social Democratic Party, the Left, the SF, the Enhedslisten and the Conservative People's Party, and it says: Proposal for adoption The Danish Parliament notes that the recruitment and retention of educational staff in several municipalities is seen as a central challenge. The Danish Parliament considers it essential that qualified educational staff with knowledge about children's well-being, development and learning be ensured across institutions, educational establishments, municipalities and parliament. A good working environment is part of the solution, and the Danish Parliament notes that the more colleagues it is possible to hire in the coming years will contribute positively to the working environment and thus to the ongoing retention and recruitment. At the same time, the Folketing considers it important to have strong and attractive educational programmes in the field, which can attract students and pupils and which can train unskilled assistants who already have experience. • V 103). Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192410	Thank you to the rapporteur. The proposal for adoption will be included in the further negotiations. Then there is a request for a few brief comments on the rapporteur, and that is first from Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192420	Thank you for your speech, and thank you for the very fine example with a local solution on how to actually get more people to care about time. This leads me to ask: does the Social Democratic Party think that every municipality should come up with its own solution and its own deep plate, or could the Social Democracy well see an idea in that we made a national plan for the recruitment of educators, which could help promote ideas on how to do so?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192449	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192453	First of all, I do not think it is an expression of the fact that in the municipal hinterland, each municipality should invent the deep plate when you choose to invite KL's children and young people summit, where there are participating municipalities from all over the country. There was a choice to give the stage to someone who had a good experience, and I take this as an expression that other municipalities too may be hungry for an idea of what the solution could be and whether there is good experience out there. I think we should perhaps be careful whether it is we who define how to exchange experience or when to exchange experience or what the good solution is. On the other hand, it is obvious that some other municipalities would be able to learn from the experience they had. I also believe that one of the keys is to say, and the leader of this day offer said that in fact also whether his staff group was quite important that it is not all or nothing. It was not the case that all of us therefore believe that there will also be a need for people to talk to their staff at local level about what they can do. But of course the ideas must come, and that is why I think it is wise to exchange experience.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192612	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192614	Pedagogues themselves demand a national recruitment plan, both to share the good examples, but also to look at the barriers that stand in the way of successful recruitment and retention of more educators. That is why I ask again: will the Social Democrats help to draw up a national plan for the recruitment of educators?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192630	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192633	If a national recruitment plan is about discussing how to have a good pedagogic education, how to have a better chance of doing so, and we have just improved that together, one might say • to take a credit teacher training and how to have enough resources, I think some things make sense in a national context. But I'm a little afraid we're gonna spend a lot of gunpowder discussing what's in our way. In fact, I think we know what some of the things that stand in the way are, and we cannot, whether we make a national plan or not, remove the challenge that some municipalities face in the short term. On the other hand, we can provide them with tools to raise their level of education, for example, or for that matter, to exchange experience. So I think we should be careful to make it a question of us in here making a plan, a paper tiger, and then discuss what is really happening out there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192729	The next brief remark is from Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192733	Thank you. I agree with the rapporteur a long way along the way. I noticed that the rapporteur was talking a little bit about this having the opportunity to take up time. It is true that there are a great many part-time pedagogues, and some would certainly like to take up time, but others would not have an interest in it. It can have several reasons. Perhaps the work is so strenuous that you almost have no energy when you are finished. That may be one of the reasons. It is a good thing that we have introduced minimum standards. But there may also be some other things that stand in the way of it. It may also be another way to have your everyday life put together. So what I see, too, is that there's a need for more carrot than whip, just when we're talking about this whole time thing. That is why I keep referring to some kind of recruitment plan. Can the rapporteur see himself in the fact that we are making a plan which has concrete initiatives which will mean that we use carrots rather than whip and, at least, in this way may cause more educators to take up time, but also more to train and stay in the field?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192838	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607192842	I think it certainly has a role to play, but there will be various reasons why educators are on reduced time, for example. But I agree with the SF's rapporteur on this and the BUPL study showed in fact that just the first experience with several educators showed that the working environment, the possibility of success, the joy of going to work, the satisfaction of it had increased. And, of course, that's a big part of the motivation. But my own example, and that was and why I took it with a different organisation of working time, is that it gave both the educational satisfaction that you actually had the educational responsibility all day because you were there, both when it started and when it ended. But it also resulted in having some of the days off that would allow you to do some of the other things, perhaps with your own children or with some other interests, and that might be what made it really feel less like pressure, even if you had been given 7 or 10 hours more a week. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it may be, it's coming in the speech now here SF and others think it should be in that recruitment plan. Of course, I refuse to make a plan, but I just think it's stupid if we politicians tell each other that if we agree to make a plan, things will be better. Of course, we need to discuss what should be included in the plan. And that's where I'd like to hear what you're kind of putting up with.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193003	Now there is another brief remark from Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193005	Thank you. Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to explain this; I will go into it in more detail in the speech. But in reality I would also like to call for a start to be made on sitting around the table. the organisations. I know that the organisations, BUPL, for example, have a lot of good ideas about how we can get started with a recruitment plan. After all, we have discussed this with BUPL, I know, even at the time when we were going to agree on how we would receive the Ukrainian refugee children. Because it also does something in relation to the degree of stress, how many children there are and how few adults there are here. So perhaps it is also really just a question whether the rapporteur can see that we are starting to get started at least if nothing else to sit around the table and say: okay, we need to talk about recruitment, we need to find out what it is going to be, and then invite the organisations in so that they can also help us see exactly what we can do about it, because the people we are talking about, the educators, are the closest ones.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193058	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193100	I am, of course, also discussing this with the organisations, but my approach to the speech was in fact also on four or five points where I think we can and should contribute from here. Some of this has already been done. However, we must contribute to a better framework for recruitment. So it is not because I reject that there may be national measures. I would just like to discuss an action rather than discuss a plan, because I really think it should be assessed on what sort of things are in it. And the fact that we've already taken action, and that no one's counting on this being something we solve with a fingertips, just shows that, regardless of how we can create a better framework, this is a square of the circle, which is a bit difficult, because as long as we have recruitment problems, it's also harder to recruit, because it's obviously less interesting to work in a field where there are no hands.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193154	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. We shall move on to the rapporteur's report. Kenneth Mikkelsen, Left. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193209	Thank you to the Radical Left for raising this important issue. When I sat and had to look into the debate here today, I allowed myself to leave my mind a little back, actually relatively far back, because even though you have passed the 50, some of the things you can remember from your childhood are those adults who have been around you. Of course, it's your parents, it's the teachers, it's the teachers. There is no doubt that these adults, who are around our children, play a crucial role for our children, and that is why I think it is important that we bring up issues like these over and over again. That is why it is good that we are taking the debate now. But maybe I should just say to the Minister for Children and Education that when I left my mind on the weekends and thought about those educators who were around me, there weren't so many former blacksmiths among them. So there has also been a development there, in relation to that we get some switches and other things made. See, we know that the recruitment and retention of educational staff is a problem, and that is a problem with in fact many facets. What is also important in a discussion like that today, a debate like that today, is that we also get dived into where the issues lie. What is the general characteristic of the problem at national level? However, there are also some more local issues that need to be addressed, possibly. by the individual municipality locally? Is the problem of recruitment and retention, for example, that there is a very large departure of older educators, as we see in parts of the public sector? Or is it that in some parts of the country there are much more children born, and that there is therefore a demographic development that really hits Denmark wrong? Or is it that over the last few decades we have looked into the fact that the education and perhaps the teaching profession is a low-wage area, why a number of trained staff apply to other subjects? Yes, these are just three examples of things that could affect the recruitment and retention of our educators around our institutions. I have heard the National Association of Municipalities mention at one point that they believe that the problem here is due, among other things, to the fact that. right now, very small adolescences, which are entering our education and further entering the labour market, are combined with the fact that our demographic development suggests that there will be far more children in our day care institutions. That is also an important argument. We know that virtually all municipalities, or at least many municipalities, have difficulty attracting and also maintaining educators, and this means that the municipalities begin to compete with each other for the labour that is then actually available. Now it is not the case for the Left that competition is ideologically evil, not even in the public sector, but there will of course be a time when this is going to be a challenge. And with the figures that have also been mentioned in today's debate, it will also become an unhealthy competition in our institutions and in our municipalities, and that is why we must tackle them. I am not going to outline any proposals, because I actually think that the two previous rapporteurs who have been up here are doing a very good job of doing so. I have been looking forward to the debate here today to hear the two ministers too. After all, I know the Minister for Children and Education, who always has the latest knowledge and research results and statistics in place, and this was also proved today. It is important that we keep bringing it to squares in the debate. So I would like to thank you now for inviting me to do so. In the Left we look forward to having the discussion here and that we will continue the discussion. We are also following the government's lead on what is of solutions, and we will play constructively into it, including in the further period here. With those words, I would like to thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193647	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur, and that is from Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193650	Thank you for your speech, and thank you for getting into this bias that is happening at the moment. I would just like to ask the rapporteur of the Left to clarify what is happening to the Left if it is so that it is the richest municipalities that can then attract the educated educators and that where there are most children in vulnerable positions there are no educators.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193712	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193715	I think we can say that this is probably already happening; we are setting off such a wage spiral, which means that wages are rising and rising. And if they only do so in some places, it will be an unhealthy competition, which is not good for the municipalities' economy, and which may in fact also not be good for the work that has otherwise been started here in the Folketing, by looking at the salaries of some of these subjects in general. So that is certainly one of the consequences.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193742	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193744	I actually think that I was thinking more about the children, that is, that the children who are the most vulnerable have not trained educators who have this professionalism with them. What does the Left think about the importance of the fact that those places in the country where there are many children who are at risk are also educated educators?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193803	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193804	Well I think I'll just come back to the beginning of my speech and say that some of what I remember from my childhood, when I think 45-50 years back, are the very adults who were around me. It has a huge impact on the children. So if we find that in parts of the country there aren't these adults present because they've been competitive, I'd have almost said that it's going to give a challenge, and it's going to give a challenge to those kids. I think I fully agree with the radical rapporteur on this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193834	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Socialist People's Party, and that is Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607193851	Thank you. And thank the authors of the motion for a resolution for raising this very important debate. In fact, I fully agree that Denmark needs more educators here and now, but also that we have an important task in designing a pedagogy work life in such a way that you have a work with meaning and that you can keep to the work throughout your life. But I am concerned as a politician, as a mother of three and as a educator, and above all I am worried about my former colleagues, because I have also been out there with them. In my vintage we were approx. Fifty, completed in 2002, and less than half of them are still away in the labour market as educators. It's pretty scary. A children's figure forecast is that by 2030 there will be 50,000 more children between 0 and 5 years of age. At the same time, we will need 14 000 more educators in 2030 if we are to keep up with the number of children and have a proper share of educators, which we all agree on is really important, and not least if we are to maintain the minimum standards that it is so historic that we have adopted together. And this concerns us in the SF, for STAR's latest figures show a unsuccessful recruitment rate of 32%. In other words, one out of every three teaching posts will be occupied by a non-pedagogic if it is occupied at all. When the SF went to elections in the last parliamentary elections, it was with the demand for minimum standards in the day-care institutions and nursery schools that it was a requirement that the educators put their professional skills into play so that they would not be allowed to run root between the children, but simply be allowed to have time for the children, have time to hug with them, provide the care that a teacher is able to provide, and give them the right impetus when the development required. And we had it introduced, and it was the first important step to lift the nursery and daycare facilities. In the SF we are concerned about the idea of pedagogy intro for assistants. It is for us to see a rather nasty and short-term patchwork solution which points to the short-term achievement of educating skills. It doesn't work to relax quality or professional ambitions, because you just don't pull your skills in a vending machine. We believe that many places need to be screwed up, and the solution is not to relax quality or professional ambitions, because the important thing is that we create the framework so that educators are allowed to be educators and to unfold their professional skills with the children, and we believe that among other things. the minimum standards ensure. Generally speaking, we believe in training positions for credit teachers as well as senior schemes and a general removal of the set-off in early retirement as the most viable solutions right now and here. It must be combined with a significantly strengthened pedagogic education, so much more people want to train themselves for educators and get better dressed for the job, so the training is in line with the pedagogic dream and the reality you are facing out there. Once I've mentioned the recruitment plan several times today, it's not for the plan. We can also call it an action plan and, as far as I am concerned, an action plan is only meaningful if we start to act on it, and I would like to make the most urgent calls for us to get one of these things started and get on with the recruitment that is so important, because it is a really big bomb under our day institutions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194236	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur and it is from Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194240	Thanks for the good speech. I would like to ask why the SF will not be involved in putting action behind words such as what we are proposing in our proposal for adoption.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194249	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194252	Thank you. Now it is the case that the negotiations that are currently taking place between the government and the municipalities are running on their own, so we do not think there is anything wrong with the text dealing with action; what is wrong is the context in which it is put. But we would really, very much like, and I think that this is perhaps the third or fourth time I have said it today, that we will have an action plan for it and that we will get exactly the recruitment on the agenda so that we can start getting started on some of these measures.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194322	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194324	I very much hope so, because I think that all the other parties have written a very fine text for adoption, there are some good things in it, but I am just concerned that there is no action to be taken and that we will then be standing in a few years' time and have talked a great deal about the importance of educators, but just looking into the fact that more and more educators are missing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194343	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194344	I am very much in agreement with the rapporteur on this. I just don't see how we can get involved. There may also be other things I can tell you I'd like us to get into the deal you're negotiating with the municipalities right now. This could, for example, be the area of disability, which is so much under pressure. There may be a lot of things I would like to put in there or help me get involved in, and that I think the government should listen to and take part in the negotiations, but that is just not where we can do it as Parliament. So let's try to put it on the agenda here together, and let's put ourselves together and make this plan, because I totally agree, we have to get started now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194420	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Enhedslisten, and that is Mr. Jakob Silver Mound. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194429	Thank you and thank you for raising the debate. I would like to start by saying that I really believe that the need to train people for either educator or educational assistant is greater than what is actually stated in the explanatory statement. If we look at the latest figures from the joint municipal pay and data office, it can be seen that if we take the entire municipal and regional employment area, there are just under 40,000 unskilled people employed in full-time positions and there are approx. 60,000 people who today work unskilled with educational work, and these are only those shown in the municipal and regional pay statistics. Besides, there are all the private employees. So we're talking about the fact that it's something like 70,000... don't hang me up on the decimal... unskilled people working in this area, and it also indicates the extent of the problem. In addition to the factual deficiency, if we are to say that it should be met here and now by more trained staff, we have all the movements that several people have mentioned here in the debate, in other words demography, the fact that there are far more children and that we have introduced minimum standards, and I also hope that together with the Minister for Social Affairs we can help to improve the quality of the whole area of social education. When I draw it in, it is of course because when we talk about education in the educational field, we have to remember that this is a common area of employment in those training courses, and that is why we cannot isolate the debate on what is really going on in the day-care sector, but we have to include the entire educational labour market if we are to assess the training needs. What is needed of initiatives? Many are needed, but I will not go through all the ones I could think of, but I might add a few in addition to those mentioned. I would hope that, following on from the recent report by the Reform Commission, which points out the problem that many adults are not so prepared, motivated to embark on training, we are trying to address it very strongly in this area. For years it has been said that systematic training planning should be introduced in general on the labour market in order to raise the large unskilled sectors in education and I think it is obvious that in an area which is at least to a very large extent regulated by public employers and authorities at one level or another, a really more coherent agreement was reached which started training the adults employed in the field. And it is not because you do not have to recruit people from outside, make sure that young people from high school take a pedagogy education, make sure that young people from primary school and the other groups take an educational assistant education, but we therefore need to do something in the field of adult education if it is to move forward. Then I hope, separately from the teaching assistant training, that something will soon happen in this area, a follow-up to the agreement made for the social and health workers, so that we get a boost in that area. What else is needed? It is also mentioned by a number of people that we must make it attractive to work in this area, because we know that there are a lot of people in this area who have taken educational training and choose to do something else. I think we've done a lot. To the fact that we have created minimum standards, we must always remember to say that it is first and foremost good for the children and for the educational quality, but it also means a lot to the individual that they experience that they do not have to run quite so fast that they are not alone with 18 young people an hour and a half in the middle of the day and we all know the stories. So it is incredibly important that we improve the working environment, and I will not fail to mention that the Committee on Salaries' Structures comes with its report in October, and I think that some of what we should have looked at when it comes is what we can do to start, including from here, pushing for a significant wage increase, both for the educators and for the teaching assistants, so that we do not just ensure that more people are trained, but that it is actually also attractive on the pay side to take educational training and to work on the subject. But thank you for raising the debate. There are a great many aspects to this, and the problem is not only 14 000, but also, in fact, that we already have a very large number of unskilled people, for whom we should initiate initiatives so that they can get training for the field of work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194948	Thank you, sir. Jakob Silverhøj and Enhedslisten. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Conservative People's Party, and that is Mrs Gitte Willumsen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607194958	Thank you for the floor. If children are to have an exciting day in a day offer, it requires skilled educators it is a natural law. Pedagogues who can make movement and play; educators who can give children natural experiences; and educators who can support language and the discovery of the book. Therefore, it is important that our day offer is some attractive jobs • some places where you can develop professionally and see yourself be, even when the baptism certificate gets older. Unfortunately, this is not the case for all educators. Many feel that they are busy; many feel that they do not strike. Of course, it shouldn't be like that when you go to work. There must be the possibility of continuing training, so that you can also see everyday life in the daily offers in 5 years, in 10 years, so that you keep up with the latest and constantly get input on how to make a good day for the children; a day of quality and not just hulmhj. When we get there, I think that young people will choose the pedagogy education for; when they can see that it is a place that is exciting and attractive, because we all want to be something for others. Pedagogic education must be attractive, and we look forward in the Conservative People's Party to discussing a new pedagogic education at some point. We also believe that it is important that we get many ways into a pedagogic education and that there will be many types of pedagogic education, so that you have the opportunity throughout your life to choose the exciting job as a teacher.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607195204	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is no wish for short remarks to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Danish People's Party, and that is Mr. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607195214	Thank you for that, President. I'm worried about this debate. We could have exactly the same debate and use a lot of the same words if we talked about the care area in the municipalities. There are exactly the same problems with recruitment, with education and with ensuring that there are enough hands. It does not mean that it is not important to talk about the area of day care and about educators, but we should just do it at the same time, because in our entire welfare area we are missing and are going to lack more smart hands, more smart heads • what you will call it • in the years to come. And then I get really worried when we have a discussion here that is based on minimum standards that actually require a great deal of extra staff to enter the day institutions. Where is that supposed to come from? The young people who need to be trained for this cannot be used elsewhere in our welfare system, and somewhere we have to work to try to find a balance and say: how do we make this sensible? That is also why we in the Danish People's Party, as a counterpart to minimum standards, have said that we must then also have minimum standards in care, so that we also make the same requirements for there to be staff. So I need a little more than that, because otherwise I agree that we should have well-trained staff in one place or another. We need further training, and we must also try to find ways for a great many more to come full-time. It will certainly help something if you can find space and frame it. I also find it interesting to talk about setting the municipalities free, that is to say to give them increased opportunities, and at the same time to say that in this area there must be so much staff. It's not freedom, it's a framework. And of course it is from a concern that you do well enough; but then I think there are other areas where I might be concerned about whether you do it well enough. So I think that there is a debate that we are simply missing and some things that we need to bring into this. At the same time, I can easily support the fact that one should of course look at the training and look at how to do it better. An angle to education could also be to look at young people with disabilities. Are we good enough to help them actually get an education if they are qualified and have the skills to do so, but just do not have the resources and abilities to take the training full-time? Then a lot of them won't get through. There is a great deal of resources if we made sure that our education system was able to handle, that we could both have more time to take the training itself, and that we could get into practice on what corresponds to flex time. It may be that it is half the time you can deliver, but then you still have to go away to cover your support so that you can get through and then maybe get out to contribute in a flex job in an institution or out in care so that we get the balance back in. I think there are some issues that we should have included in this debate, and I would actually just like to call for that to be remembered in the further discussion. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607195531	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is no wish for short remarks to the rapporteur, and so all the rapporteurs who wanted to speak have spoken, and it seems that it is the Minister for Children and Education to whom I give the floor as the first. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607195547	Thank you. After all, I am not the fourth Social Democrat who is on the floor, because there are only three of us, but this is the fourth time that there is a Social Democrat in this debate, so I think it might be an exaggeration after all. I would therefore just like to say that what the SF says about being able to keep to the work all your life, I am very, very much in agreement with, and that this is an important guide to looking at how we can maintain. That then leads me to what Conservatives are saying about it being an attractive workplace, and then I just can't help it. As I understand it in Conservatives, one is not insanely happy that we have spent so much money on minimum standards, and it is nevertheless interesting that it can then be in space while at the same time wanting it to be attractive jobs. My analysis is that there has been a need for, and that we have failed to give enough money to the children's area for a very long time, and that we have therefore had to put forward the huge cheque book on the part of the government, and it has not been in common with the Conservatives, but together with the SF, the Enhedslisten and the Radicals, who have had it as a very great wish that they went in and got it right here after years with a bourgeois government. So it's just to say that I just feel like I'm getting hit by the fact that it's just too easy to stand and say. After you have cut down the way you have, after you have not supported a welfare law, the mood here, in my opinion, becomes just a little too good if you just get away with saying that. I believe that the structural framework around these jobs means a great deal, and that is to say, the conditions we give the economy, i.e. whether there are enough hands, there are adults enough to actually deliver a decent educational job, and that you go home from work with a sense of having really got delivered, because that is what you are proud of, and that is what you want with your work, that is why you have taken that training or whether there isn't. And boiled down, it also ends up being about money, and at least when you've run the municipalities as hard as you've done over all those years with a blue government, and when, of course, you don't want to vote for a welfare law that would otherwise make the money come along, both when, as the Danish People's Party says, there are more older people, where extra money has to be followed by • it's in the welfare law and when there are more children. We have not been able to get the blue parties involved in this, and I am extremely sorry about this, which means that the creation of attractive jobs in the public sector is the way we have known it through the 00s, first under Anders Fogh Rasmussen and then under Lars Løkke Rasmussen, where it is the sort of thing you stand and say, and the money just never comes with, and it is the savings round on the savings round out there, and I do not think that is how it contributes to the retention. On the other hand, I am very curious about what the Danish People's Party brings to the table. I find it interesting to go in and look at young people and adults with disabilities in relation to whether we can be better at giving that group a foothold in the labour market. We know, for example, that a very large proportion of young people who have blindness in their luggage have a desire to work, but that they cannot get stuck in the labour market because we do not have a spacious enough labour market and because we do not have good enough training conditions. So it is just to say, as far as the part that is on my table is concerned, that my door is always open and that I would like to look at what we can do better and more of. So it is just a commitment from here, and I know that the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party is very concerned about this. I also know that some of this costs a great deal of money, and it will of course be a financial bill table, but we have managed to reach an agreement on a specially organized education, not least because Mr. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl has put a great deal of pressure on it, and I believe that we have made a really, really good and solid agreement that brings us closer to the fact that more young people with disabilities will be able to bite both the education and labour market system. And then I am convinced that we must avoid wear and tear. We are wearing out immensely many people in our society, and we simply cannot afford that either for the sake of those people or a labour market that is overheated. But thank you very much for a good debate. I have nothing more to add, and now I will leave the floor to the next one in this debate, and is it the fifth Socialist? I guess so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200007	The Minister will not, because there is just a brief comment to be made to the Minister, and it is of course the President who is giving the floor. So we can't do this! Mrs Lotte Rod has the floor for a brief comment. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200016	Well, with the incredibly many Social Democrats, we can do something about it. We can just do what the Prime Minister said on the Constitutional Day, that is to say, to make a wider government, and then it sort of solves itself with how many Social Democrats are going to talk to a question debate. However, I would like to ask about some of the specific elements and, of course, I am not asking about the money. Because I fully understand that everything that costs money and something like that is something we take in connection with the Finance Act, so this is more to get the Minister to say whether the Minister shares my analysis that there is a need to do more of these combination positions, that is to say, as a way of maintaining some educators, even when they get up in the years, and that they can have some career paths where you can work a few days a week in the institution and some days a week teaching on a pedagogic education.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200102	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200104	I simply do not want to interfere with who teaches the education of teachers, especially while my colleague, Mr Gundelach, is here. Jesper Petersen is in the hall. So I'm thinking that the question is certainly relevant, but not to me.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200118	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200119	Well, it will still be relevant to end up as a national action plan to create some models where it is possible at all, so that it can be linked to the institutions, and therefore also the other question. The whole thing about making such a pedagogy a belief and will probably not ask about those who are on the courses, but thinking in models that some of them really are high school students or others who take a sabbatical year work in a daycare institution, that then the minister could see so that it would make sense that they got the chance to get in to sniff out some education both so that they get a professional ballast to stand on, and I'm on it, as the SF's rapporteur says, it's not at all because you're being educating from having a day or 3 days or whatever it is for some models, but that it could at the same time allow you to actually recruit some more.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200205	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200207	Now we're both here, so it's not like that to shoot anything further, but I'm thinking that an introduction to the pedagogic education isn't my desk either. I can imagine all sorts of things between heaven and earth, but I think that we are two ministers of the public and that I am just not the Resort Minister for Education. But fortunately, we have Mr. Jesper Petersen present in the hall.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200230	The next brief remark is to Mr. Kenneth Mikkelsen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200233	Thank you. Perhaps that is actually a comment, because the Minister has now brought in a welfare law, and the Socialist rapporteur did so too. There I feel the urge to say that we in the Left actually want to follow the demographic move and use the money that is needed for that part. But when we do not agree to a welfare law, it is because the Social Democrats and the government only want to look at one side of the board. So we want to look at both sides of the board and say that the money that comes in will also have to be needed in order for us to pour out money. It is sound economic policy that the Left stands for. And I just need to make that point.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200317	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200318	Sometimes you have to follow what politicians have actually done instead of what they say. And that is simply not what a Left Government did, either under Lars Løkke Rasmussen or under Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200332	Sir. Kenneth Mikkelsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200333	Now I think we're mixing up two things. Because when we talk about a welfare law, it is, after all, a proposal that has been put forward by the Socialist Government now and on which we have had several debates in the Parliamentary Assembly. We can go back. We can take very good time to go back and analyze what has happened. But it is very clever that the Minister should not mention the government led by Mrs Helle Thorning-Schmidt, for example. But let it go. I just needed to tell you why we are not in the welfare law that the Minister and the Social Democrat transferer brought in.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200404	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200405	What I am responding to is what the rapporteur says is that the Left wants to follow the demographic trend. The legislation we have now proposed has been rejected, and this has been done with some set of arguments. What I'm saying is that sometimes we just have to keep up with what you actually did when you had the opportunity. And then they didn't follow the demographic move, with the result that even if there were more elderly people and more children every year, money didn't follow. In other words, the money in the public sector had to be stretched over a much larger task. That is why savings rounds were held on savings rounds over those years. So sometimes you just have to look at what the politicians do, because then you get the answer to what they really want.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200446	The next brief remark is to Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200450	Thank you. Now I've been on the labour market for actually quite many years. I have more than 25 years of anniversary and I've actually always worked in the municipal system. So with regard to the issue of creating attractive jobs, I would like to say that I agree that it also has something to do with money, but it is not just that. Can the Minister not acknowledge that, in other words, it is not just about money if you are to have an attractive place of work?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200512	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200513	Yes, but it's now a very good place to start. I am actually looking at all sorts of other things too, but for 1.8 billion. kr. A year you get in the vicinity of 3,800 educators, I believe. I think that's a very good place to start.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200533	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200534	Money we can't find. But then I would say that during the time I have been on the labour market, the greatest cuts in the public sector were when we last had a social democratic government. It was a bloodbath in the municipality I was in. So standing here bouncing on it, I think it's inconvenient. It seems to me that attractive jobs also have something to do with the possibility of being retrained. It has something to do with having visible management, and it has something to do with having access to the things and media you need to do your job, and I hope the Minister can acknowledge that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200610	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200612	I can certainly acknowledge that. I really wish we had had a third round, because I would also like the Conservative rapporteur to recognise that we are actually sending 1.8 billion. kr. extra per year to the day institutions. Well, that's what happens to the minimum standards. After all, we can discuss the possibility of doing all sorts of other things; good management is also a very good idea if you are to have a good workplace. So there are also a lot of other things. What is merely the reality of the day-care institutions and, incidentally, of the schools, to which we have also set aside a great deal of extra money, is that they have been subjected to so many savings that a great deal of the other has become nice to gardens, where what was needed to have was simply to get more hands out, so that you had time to do the fundamental educational work that you have trained yourself to, which you want and which you want to do with the children who are out there. So it takes money, at least not just the other things.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200705	The next brief remark is to Mr. Jakob Silverhøj, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200708	I have experienced before that I do not have much success in bringing forward answers about tripartite negotiations; nevertheless, I have mentioned it in my rapporteur's speech, converted into full-time jobs 40,000-45,000 unskilled people corresponding to 60,000-70,000 people in this area. I am thinking that this might actually give rise to something being done soon in order to put the training of the unskilled into a system. So I am trying again: can we not expect a tripartite agreement to come soon, in which we can tackle not only the problem of day-to-day offers, but also the major problems in the whole of the specialized social area, where there are incredibly many unskilled workers?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200754	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200755	I don't want to interfere in the specialized social area... otherwise I have a habit of doing that for many years until I became Minister of Education, because then it wasn't really my job anymore. But I would like to say something to the other. In fact, today we succeeded in not being able to do so. On the other hand, I would say that the time has passed because I know that there is some impatience about what has been spent on, among other things. to make the evaluation that has just been published on PAUN; I think it has been important. And sometimes it's more luck than understanding that something is pulling in the right direction. One of the things that has been moving in the right direction over the last six months is that it seems that there has been a ketchup effect on the pau education. This means that in the debate on how to measure the number of student places forward, we are in a completely different place now than if we had made an agreement back in January; so sometimes it is more lucky a sense. In fact, I believe that we have a better basis for a trialogue now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200855	Sir. Jakob Silver Mound.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200856	The evaluation that has been made of the teaching assistant training is very positive indeed. I understand that I am not getting a very specific answer as to when the negotiations will start, but I would just like to say that when I mention the specialized social area, it is not for the Minister to decide what is needed of posts there; but nevertheless, I think it is important, and that is why I have made a little of it in my rapporteur's speech, that when we talk about training for these areas, we have training for more labour markets. If you don't try to think of it as a whole, you can risk thinking that you will solve a problem if you look very closely at the fact that we are now training for this area and that it turns out that they are all actually seeking employment elsewhere. So it is simply a call, now that there are two major areas of employment, that it is thought into the plans you are making for training initiatives.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200956	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607200956-2	I fully agree with that. And I also agree with the part that the evaluation of the pau training is extremely good, especially with regard to the results here, which show how much is already taken up as newly educated people incredibly favorably compared with other professional groups, without mentioning names where new graduates are not taken quite as positively; then, of course, they come after what is clear. Some of this reflects that some of the paus are older and have been in the profession for many years before they have taken an educational assistant training and this is reflected in the figures. So I'm very fond of that evaluation, but most of all I'm glad about this because it seems that the pau labour market has really gotten off the ground. It has actually been a source of great surprise to me that in every conceivable context we are talking about having more practice, we need more internship, and then we have not been employed from the training that can do all that. This has been started now, and I think that is a huge gain both for the children, but of course also for recruitment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201057	Thank you to the Minister for Children and Education. There are no further brief comments to be made to the Minister in this area. Now I would like to welcome the Minister of Education and Research. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201109	Thank you. Here is another socialist speech in the debate here and a contribution to the discussion, which I think has again shown recognition of the importance of the subject and a political interest in strengthening it. This applies to recognition of it, recruitment for it, quality of training, working conditions, etc. I agree with all of this, and I also think that there are some additional angles to where we started. Mrs Lotte Rod is talking about the need to sniff out the training and the subject, and perhaps you can find some ways of doing that, but I would really like to add to what I have said earlier that, in order to recruit more and raise awareness of the subject, it is a part of what I think is important, namely that we make up a little bit in our society, that the more academic an education is, the more fine it is as having to take on the fact that then we put more prestige into it. We can really do this, for example. the teaching profession makes a huge difference to others, as they will benefit from the rest of their lives and also at a very important time in life when we are talking about day care institutions or in the labour market, Mr. Jakob Silverhøj has mentioned, with some more vulnerable people of also an adult age who need skilled social educators. So maybe you can, but what this curl was supposed to end with was also about how the culture and guidance for young people are and where, when you finish high school, you go. Is it very much aimed at the fact that it is natural that it is the academic one seeking, or could it be just as natural to apply to professional colleges and, for example, to apply to professional colleges? a pedagogic education? In any case, it is also, I think, a place where there is a need for more people to sniff and know that the courses exist and are good and that it is a good subject to get into with very meaningful work. Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk has mentioned various of the issues we touched on before, that is, that there is too much apostasy from the profession and that there is a need for a significantly strengthened education. I agree with that, and I hope that was also reflected in my introduction. That's where we're going, and that's where we're going. process the great apostasy with a strengthened internship and guidance and feedback along the way in the training. How a pay structure committee comes out, I dare not go into today, but that, of course, is also part of this discussion. I can hear that, sir. Jakob Silverhøj has concluded on it in advance and can almost set amounts on what is to be done. I can't do that, but I would like to mention the attention that lies in the fact that the government has also set up this pay structure committee, which is going to barrage later on. Then I do not know if that was perhaps one of the things my good colleague Mrs Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil would have liked to have said, but if I were to contribute a little to the bad mood and a little more conflicting part of the discussion that began here, I would say that I fully agree with the observations that have been made and that I remember what it was like as the financial rapporteur and other things for a long time to discuss the issue of zero growth in the public sector with representatives from the previous government. Because it is something new that the Left does as if they actually think it is important for the public sector economy to follow when there are more older and more children. That's something new. Now you do not live up to it because you do not vote for this welfare law, but in the past you simply did not have that view either. There we have actively had the view that the public sector should not become larger, and I just think that we should stand by that is what has been the case. It is the same parties who are also talking about the importance of good education here, and I am glad that you think so, and hopefully we can agree to change it, to improve it, and perhaps also to find money for it. That is what is needed if we are to succeed. However, just to remind you of where we come from there, I would like to say that it has been a previous parliamentary term with annual savings on education. They stopped when this government came in and more funds were then added to the pedagogic education which we are talking about today. It's just that everyone brought the history, including those who had to listen. On the other hand, I am so pleased with the support which civil parties have also given to the agreement on the decentralization of education and local presence, because I agree with the point made by one of the rapporteurs, perhaps it was also indeed Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk that ensuring that educating education is present in many parts of the country, is one of the things we are doing with that agreement. In fact, it also involves an increased taximeter in many cases for courses at professional colleges, which are located around outside the largest cities. And just to conclude with the good atmosphere, I would like to say that I think that Mrs Gitte Willumsen made some good wordings on how to really be something for others in the teaching profession. Of course, we should not be doing advertising as a minister, but we are probably saying today that it would be a good idea for those who might be interested in this subject to apply to it. In these weeks there are many who are considering what to apply to an education; there is a deadline right around the corner to it. The ad comes here, because Copenhagen University School is riding, I think, a good slogan, which I have allowed myself to refer to sometimes: that it is not about what you want to be, but who you want to be. I think it is very good to say that this subject is really something where you are something for others, and if we can translate a discussion like this today into the benefit of the subject and benefit the children and vulnerable citizens who benefit from the educators, and if we can raise the education and attractiveness of both the job and the education, I would think we had done something good politically together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201717	Thank you, Minister. There is a request for a brief comment, and that is from Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201720	Thanks for the speech. The minister spoke earlier about the new opportunity in among other things. Odense, but if you're from Aabenraa or Haderslev there's still some way to Odense. I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether the Minister shares my view that if we really have to put something on merit education, we actually have to have courses in all municipalities, so also parents who are educators and have small children and may not be able to drive all the way to the nearest place of education, will have much better opportunity to take a credit course • so if there was such a volume that you could have the courses quite locally in your own municipality.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201801	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201803	It will be possible to train both educational assistants and credit teachers in all municipalities, but it will then be associated with a professional college in the vicinity where the training exists. It will do so in many parts of the country, among others. As a result of the agreement which the Radical Left unfortunately does not share, there are various reasons for this, and it is another debate which ensures that there are also educational opportunities at professional colleges close to them, even in the years that come now when we have falling youth years. What I mentioned was specifically the switching model, which until now only existed in Copenhagen, but now also comes to Aarhus and Odense. It is among other things. aimed at unemployed academics and others. But the fact that local authorities are concerned that they have trained staff and that they use the opportunities offered by educational assistants or credit teachers, I would strongly recommend and encourage them to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201902	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201904	I would also like to ask the Minister whether he will be involved in promoting combined positions where educators can work a few days a week in a kindergarten or nursery and some days a week teaching on a pedagogy education.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201916	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607201917	In any case, I would say that on some of the visits I have been to, among other things. in Slagelse at Absalon, and where I have met with educators students we have now brought Mrs Astrid Carøe to the Parliament Hall for the upcoming debate, and she has been on some of the visits to be the teachers who have themselves been educators, after all, highlighted by the educators. They can relate to everyday life and be good at linking the things you experience in everyday life as a teacher with theoretical teaching. So it clearly has a quality, I think, that in this way one has had a leg in both camps. How they choose to hire at the individual professional college I cannot decide, but I clearly believe there is a quality in having someone who also has that experience from everyday life. If you can fit it into the training, I would also like to have someone in an institution in everyday life, so that you can connect the two weekdays closely together. I also think there are professional colleges that are experimenting with it, and let us see if it is not something that will spread if it is successful.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607202025	There are no further brief comments to be made to the Minister. Thank you, Minister. Since no more people have been asked to speak, the debate has ended and, as I said, the vote on the proposals for adoption will not take place until tomorrow, Wednesday, 8 June.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607202046	I would also point out here that the vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until tomorrow, Wednesday 8 June. I can therefore begin by giving the floor to the rapporteur of the questioners, and that is Mrs Katrine Robsøe, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607202132	Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the Left, the SF, the Enhedslisten and the Conservatives for helping to put the question and, of course, also thank the other parties present and the Minister for their time. I am very pleased that we in this Parliament have the opportunity to discuss distrust among our students and possible initiatives, because I am deeply concerned about the growing distrust that exists among young people, including in our educational institutions. In the latest Health Profile, more than one in three women and one in five men between the ages of 16 and 24 indicated that they have poor mental health. 19% In the latest version of the study Education Zoom, students at higher education state that they always or often experience strong symptoms of stress in their everyday life in the programme. I do not imagine that we can solve everything this evening, but I hope that in this debate we can have a very good preliminary discussion on how we can move towards more action and steps in the right direction.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607202243	Thank you to the rapporteur for the questioners for justifying the question. And I can give the floor to the Minister for Education and Research for an answer. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607202255	Thank you. Thank you to the parties behind the debate here and to Mrs Katrine Robsøe for the explanatory statement. The benefit of higher education students is an important issue and, of course, is part of a discussion that is at all about the growing distrust we see. The Ministry of Education and Research collected data on student stress and loneliness for the first time in 2018. The debate and focus on dissatisfaction among a number of young people were already present, but the figures that emerged were, after all, another basis for the relevance of the debate that we will continue today. One in five students replied that they always or often had severe stress symptoms in daily life, and one in ten that they always or often felt lonely. And although it is of course a special life to be a student and there is also naturally a pressure on students in connection with exams and to have to acquire a lot of material, it must be said that these were high figures. At the same time, figures from the State Institute for Public Health in 2019 and now again with the latest inventory in 2021 showed that for many young people too, mental health is bad at all. A large proportion of young people are in higher education or are entering education, and therefore the education system can also be an obvious place to take action to support and strengthen the well-being of young people, students. There are several places in the education system where action can be taken when strengthening the well-being. For example: the latest figures from the Danish Study Survey show that 31%. of the students agree with or agree that they hold back from asking questions and participating actively in order not to risk looking stupid in the teaching. And it tells me that there will be a focus on communities, on learning culture, on the security of being in the learning situation in higher education. It may also reflect a culture of perfection, which sneaks in at all and is a very unhappy phenomenon in our society. But there are these attention points, and we do not currently have frameworks that fully promote curiosity, learning and well-being, and a learning culture that supports those things. Recently I saw Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen, who, as you know, is Secretary-General of the Save Children and one of our former colleagues here in the Danish Parliament, say that there is probably a need for a little less Pippi Longstocking and a little more Harry Potter in relation to the well-being of children and young people. And I really appreciate the very strong and independent girl in Astrid Lindgren's universe, who lives alone and solves her problems himself and in many ways is a very strong person, but there is also the point that the challenges you meet do not necessarily have to be solved alone and that you are not a failure if things do not succeed or you feel bad. This does not mean that you just have to pull yourself together or that you fail as a single person or as a student, and that is where we may need a little more Harry Potter in the debate and as a figure. In that universe, the sorcerer's boy fights the greatest evil in cooperation with others with different forces and abilities. Harry Potter could not have won the fight if it were not for the community around him, both the helpful and supportive friends and the adults who guide and protect him and indeed sometimes forgive him if he has stepped wrong every now and then. Most of the time, he's gone wrong because he actually tried to do the good. The growing distrust is a complex problem, and this also applies to the answer. But we come the longest if we support strong inclusive communities, I mean. It must not be the responsibility of the individual; it is not just a stressed or lonely student who has to pull himself together and solve his or her things a little faster. We can afford to have expectations of each other. It is clear, and we all have responsibilities, that we have to live up to, but the framework is what is very crucial for the individual. And it is a responsibility that we all have as parents, politicians, teachers or fellow students to try to lift and support each other. I also think it is important to be aware that this is not a problem that applies in isolation to our students or the education system. We see across children and youth generations that there are challenges with mental health, loneliness, anxiety and mental disorders. So we cannot solve the whole challenge of higher education, but it is an important arena in the lives of many young people, so there are several meaningful places we can put in. Many important initiatives have already been taken to strengthen the well-being, for example. through stronger communities. Some of the initiatives are structural. in relation to the abolition of the education ceiling, and this is the case with the forthcoming negotiations on the changes to the admission system for higher education, which I hope will also help address this discussion. These initiatives have been and can help to remove some of the pressures that young people are experiencing, for example. In relation to grades, you have to choose correctly in all facets of life, including study choices. We are turning on some of the big more structural wheels that can make a difference in relation to the wheel. There are also several things that must not and cannot be resolved by us politically, but instead must be resolved at the institutions where the framework for students is created in everyday life. We have, among other things. supported by means for well-being-oriented activities both before and in connection with the covid-19 closures. Other initiatives are about concrete changes at higher education institutions, where well-being, learning and the environment are closely linked with the teaching. That's why there's one of them. written objectives of learning and well-being into the institutions' strategic framework contracts. This is something that we, as a government, have been focusing on in that dialogue with the institutions. The process of institutions has been completed and it is a very general thing that work on the well-being of students is part of what the institutions themselves say they will commit themselves to working on in the coming years. I think it is very positive that this way we listen down and that signal and the problem as an institution. There are other examples that I think are worth highlighting. Student counselling and University of Southern Denmark have developed a digital offer that, with a slightly dull English expression, onboards students 14 days before the start of studies. 20,000 new students will meet the offer this year, and it will support security in the transition to education. It is good for the individual student's well-being that you get a good start and can quickly feel that you become part of the community in the programme. Another good example of how distrust can be reduced among students is Aarhus Architects' School, which has halved the students' experienced stress. They have done so, among other things. to train teachers and mentors to support students and help them to more realistic expectations of what an architect student is and what is expected of them. Several of the initiatives already live in the best way out in higher education institutions, for example. via the framework contracts I mentioned before. This means that there is already a lot of bottom-up, that is, from the individual institution, which I hope can be an inspiration to others and which can also continue without us taking new political initiatives in this way. And this everyday focus is a prerequisite if students' well-being is to be seriously strengthened. But we cannot let go of the agenda in here at Christiansborg. Sustained focus and continued attention to well-being are important in the various political discussions we have. I would therefore also like to thank the authors of the question again for the opportunity to give an overview and some examples of the work to strengthen the well-being of students. I think it is good that we in the Folketing continue to have this focus and an intention to address this very important issue, which for some is very intrusive and for others to a lesser extent, but where we can do it better than we do today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203151	Thank you. One brief comment from the rapporteurs is now available. The first goes to Mrs Katrine Robsøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203158	Thank you. I'm always happy when the minister can involve both Harry Potter and strong inclusive communities in a speech... then you hit pretty well. So thank you for that. When we discuss social problems in this Parliament, we sometimes think that we can solve everything from in here. I very much agree with the Minister that we cannot do that. In connection with this question debate, I have spoken with the organisation Saga, which is working on the involvement of young people in decision-making processes, and I would therefore like to know whether the Minister has any suggestions on how to get young people to come forward with solutions to this challenge that we face in relation to the well-being of our higher education and the distrust of young people, so that we actually get them into the solution room.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203300	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203302	Thank you. Yeah, that's a good question and another good angle on this subject. It can be said that there is of course something particularly authoritative about the fact that it is also young people and students themselves who help to come up with some of the solutions. I think it is important to do this in everyday life in the institutions, in other words to support active student environments and to try to involve students in the decisions that are being taken in the associations and organizations that exist. I also think it is important that we do so from a political point of view. After all, there is support for those organisations, but also that we listen to some of the same organisations when we make political decisions. I am in the process of preparing for this debate on the recording system, and this is the latest example of how I think it was last week that I had a series of representatives of youth organisations, student organisations, student movements in my office to listen to them in connection with that work. I have to work hard to do that in all these relationships that affect students.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203421	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Astrid Carøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203425	Thank you. I very much agree with the Minister that this is a wide-ranging issue, and I do not think that there are any quick solutions. This is also something that we clearly see in the whole education system, not only in higher education. But one of the things that young people often mention when asked what makes them miserable is this constant momentum needed in their education, whether it is in upper secondary education or in higher education. But now we're talking about higher education today. And I'm really glad that we've got more and more of these drive measures from the drive reform in the grave, but there's still some of the jokes out there, and we hear about students who experience that they're not being taken up by their educational institution with their needs, but that they have to fit into the system. That is why I would just like to ask the Minister whether we should not look at whether there are still some things left from the drive reform that we need to put right into the grave.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203535	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203537	Thank you. I agree that it is good that various political initiatives have been taken to change the issues that have been discussed a great deal in the past. Of course, it cannot be the case that we completely stop having a look at the fact that there is a momentum. And I would say that it actually also helps to strengthen the individual's sense that things are going well in the study, and that you actually experience that you have a progression and move on, pass exams and come closer to being finished. So that is a perspective that is also important to hold on to. However, the more specific things that Mrs Carøe might think about here and where there are some examples of some inappropriateness, I would like to hear about and discuss and discuss without being able to give any specific commitments in advance. So I hope that you can hear the balance and nuances of my answer, that is to say that there is a glance at the fact that it is actually important to move forward and not to get stuck while there are no inappropriate pressure situations either. I guess that's the balance we're gonna try to find.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203641	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Victoria Velasquez. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203645	Thank you. It could be exciting if we did not have to look at the activity and performance subsidies for example. universities, which, of course, are helping to push it. That is one economic aspect, but it is another economic aspect I would like to ask about. I agree that well-being is complex, and now the Minister himself grabbed Pippi Longstocking, and Pippi Longstocking is very rich. She has a coffin filled with gold, and that is not quite the picture we see among youth. On the contrary, there is a growing inequality. There is a skewed access to the housing market, and the su has been hollowed out with just under 5,000 kroner. a year. I would therefore like to know what the Minister's thoughts are about, whether the economic situation does not also have an impact on the well-being of young people in this complexity.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203734	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203736	Of course, it has a meaning. I would say that, just as not all young people have a casket full of gold, we do not have it as a government, so that you can accommodate everything you would like. But I also think we have to say that there is something here that in our society is yes, what should we say a little more paradoxical, because most young people in Denmark will end up having an education and doing well. We have high employment, good opportunities to take education. I think it is important that we have the good su system that we have in Denmark, and although some people give me a little hump for it, I was also quick to say that the proposal to convert su into loans on Master's degree programmes I do not agree with. It's not one the government wants to promote. But even if we have such good conditions as we have in an international comparison, we still have problems of dissatisfaction. So even if the economy plays a role, we must also look at other things, I think, in order to understand everything and actually address it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203849	Thank you to the Minister this time. We shall now proceed to the debate and to the general rules for short remarks. The first rapporteur is the rapporteur for the authors, Mrs Katrine Robsøe from the Radical Left, who does not need to panic, but can come up here now. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607203913	I think it takes a little more for me to panic. But thank you for the floor. When you are young today sitting in your dorm room, there is a lot that can be difficult. You may have just left home, you have started an education, you have a few courses that you may not be as happy about as you had hoped, and it may make you doubt whether you have chosen the right studio and if you can do it. You may not have found quite as many new friends as you dreamed of, and you may feel alone sometimes. Perhaps you feel an expectation pressure from yourself, your parents, or all sorts of others. But I guess it's not so much different than it was for generation before us. Nevertheless, the figures only go in one direction when we look at the well-being of young people, and that is the wrong way to go. Perhaps this is because for you who live in the dorm room, you should both be good at the studio and go to the Friday bar. You must have both the top-of-the-line study-relevant work and have the meaningful volunteer job next door. You are torn and torn in because you and your peers have to solve all the problems of the world from the climate crisis to the lack of hands in health care. Your generation will secure enough hands in the care of the elderly, in the kindergarten in the engineering firm, on the construction site, in the primary school and much more. You must be innovative, adaptable, innovative, good at working with others, good at working independently, etc. I am almost out of breath just saying it, so I understand that young people can also be breathed in their everyday lives. When I'm sneaking it up like this, it's to make it clear that it's probably not just one thing that's causing the increased distrust, but also that I'm not trying to tell you or anyone else that I have all the solutions to this problem. But I think there are places where we can put in. Something is more straightforward than anything else, but I hope that together we can find a variety of measures that together can help make a difference. I think that we, as politicians, are extremely wise not to talk about this as a problem for young people, because it is not. Young people are not weak or without resistance, but we have a social problem when so many people still feel pressured and we have a social problem that is neither easy nor simple. There are measures that we have talked about in the past, on which I, of course, still believe action should be taken. They cannot, of course, be entirely confined to the area of higher education, nor are they proposals which necessarily make a direct difference there, but overall I believe that this can help to make a difference for young people. I believe, among other things, as the Minister also mentioned, that we need to have a look at the rating scale that can benefit our entire education system. I am more than ready to look at our admission system, where it is extremely important for Radicals that we try to find a model where young people are less pressured. I am a huge advocate of more guidance for educational choices, but also for study guidance, because all children and young people deserve guidance for their educational choices, so that they have the best conditions for choosing what is right for them. But all students may actually also need guidance on what it's like to be a student, because it's something you have to learn, and there are a lot of choices and challenges along the way. However, as I said earlier, it is by no means all the solutions that I have here. That is why I hope that together we can find a way to get both experts, but to a large extent also young people themselves involved in finding solutions, without placing young people responsible for the challenge. We have a responsibility as politicians, but I think we can find the best solutions in terms of the well-being of our higher education together with those who are currently in those educations. That is why I also hope that we can at least consider such a thing as a welfare commission for our higher education, so that we can have a comprehensive overview of the possibilities and do so together with our educational institutions and young people. It's one idea, but I'm open to all sorts of other ideas. What is important to me is that we do something about what we can do about, in order to find solutions and put action behind words. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607204412	Thank you very much to the rapporteur for the questions. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Kasper Roug of the Social Democrats. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607204438	Thank you for that, President. First of all, I would like to thank the proposers for putting this important issue on the agenda. After all, the study period has the potential to be the best years in a student's life, at least some of us remember it as well, and fortunately there are a lot of others who can, but for too many years of study and youth are associated with stress and displeasure. The figures speak their own worrying language. The latest health profile shows that more than one in three women and one in five men between the ages of 16 and 24 indicate that they have poor mental health. That is a lot of people, and it is extremely worrying. It is worrying that we are building a society that does not adequately address the misfortune of young people. We do not know for sure what the causes are, but in the latest version of the study Education Zoom says 19 per cent. of students in higher education that they experience strong symptoms of stress in their everyday life on the programme. This suggests that education also plays a role. We have been focusing on the issue for a long time, and we have taken important steps to meet the challenge. On the one hand, we have abolished the ceiling on education and, on the other, we have improved the economy of education, so that more education and feedback can be given priority in the institutions. Of course, we do not imagine that this has been resolved, and therefore I am delighted that we in the Danish Parliament have a constant focus on the issue. Today's debate also bears witness to this, and I hope that in future we will also be able to agree to follow developments closely, and on behalf of S, SF, RV, EL, KF and FG, I would like to make the following: proposals for adoption • A majority of the parties of the Folketing are concerned about the growing distrust among young people today. 19% of higher education students state that they always or often experience strong symptoms of stress in their everyday life in the programme. We want a society and a culture where as many people as possible are well, and a culture of education with a focus on empowerment, education, learning and well-being. The parties note that several efforts have been made to promote the well-being of students, among others. by actively thinking well-being and learning into the framework of higher education institutions. For example: objectives have been set for learning and well-being in higher education, strategic framework contracts, and funds have been allocated both before and during the covid-19 closures. The majority see youth distrust as a serious and complex social problem requiring sustained focus and action. Therefore, the majority expect the government to follow up today's question by autumn 2022 with discussions on possible actions. • 22.00].
ParlaMint-DK_20220607204745	Thank you for giving me the text, which we will just check for formalities. There are a few brief comments and the first is from Mrs Astrid Carøe of the Socialist People's Party. I saw that Mrs. Katrine Robsøe was enrolled but disappeared. I'm sorry, I'm just the one who can't figure out the technique up here. It is not Mrs Astrid Carøe, but Mrs Katrine Robsøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607204812	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. I would really like to try to listen to this with guidance when you're a student. I would like to know whether we could not find solutions to this jointly with the Social Democratic Party. I certainly believe that some of what we can do to help promote the thriving is, if you actually have someone, that you can actually ask for advice on all these questions you have when you are a student. There are plenty of rules you can be afraid of going wrong and therefore get hit by something you can't change, and therefore you can be nervous about if you're doing the right thing. So I'm really into this, about whether we can't do anything to get more guidance in. I would really like that if the Social Democratic Party could also see some music in it, also in relation to when we have to talk recording system and our entire study rift.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607204905	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607204909	Thank you. I shall not be able to reject anything in advance in relation to what can work, but there is no doubt that I have great confidence that guidance can also be managed by the educational institutions themselves. Nevertheless, I do not really think that we are going to have to look at just one thing, such as. guidance. I think we are going to have to look at a lot of different facets in terms of how we can increase the prosperity of young people. I mean, that's one way of doing that. also be other • what to call the information and other knowledge we have about the size of the study environments or other. There's a lot of good experience out there. I think that we need to look at a great many of them and that we need to look at them broadly, and then we need to see what can be done.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607204958	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205000	It certainly sounds as if we have support for a welfare commission when we are going to look so wide. I am asking because, in connection with the Ministry of Education's reviews and thematic meetings on the admission system, we have talked a lot about how to reduce apostasy. Apostasy can of course have both a very, very good reason, but it can also be because you feel really bad about your study and you are miserable. So I could see that we could actually reduce distrust and reduce apostasy at the same time, and that is why I very much hope that the Social Democratic Party will also take a look at this part.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205034	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205035	There's no doubt that we're looking at this widely; of course we have to do that too. We're going to look even wider at what works in relation to the thriving. Several things have already been introduced, for example. This is something which also bears witness to the fact that we in the government and, of course, not least in the Social Democratic Party are aware that this is something we need to look at widely.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205109	Thank you. Now I give the floor to Mrs Astrid Carøe from the SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205113	Thank you. You want the floor, but I do not think Mrs Katrine Robsøe should be cheated. I would really like to follow up on what Mrs Katrine Robsøe said, namely this apostasy. One of the things we also see is that the apostasy is the greatest among the young people who have the most difficulty going the straight way, that is, the young people who cannot just take a long higher education of five years. It may be because you have a diagnosis, but it may also be because you have children at home, or it may be anything else. What I dream about is that we have a system of education that suits the individual and where there is flexibility, so that it is adapted to where you are in life, so that people who are a little longer in life also have the opportunity to take an education. Should we not look at the flexibility of those educations in terms of well-being?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205205	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205205-2	I think that there is already a high degree of flexibility in education and training, which can be used in relation to the education and training programmes. There is, of course, a complete freedom of method in relation to, among others. guidance for individual students. A lot of resources are being spent on counselling out there already now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205228	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205229	One of the things the students experience is that they meet a rather rigid system when they, for example, meet. ask about postponement or leave if they have been ill or such things. I think it's because some parts of the drive reform are still joking. But then there are some very specific things, for example. Such a thing with, if you have a disability that makes you study at a reduced time, and when you go on an internship as an educator, you can go on reduced time, but then it goes beyond the pay you receive during your internship, and this makes it difficult for the vast majority of educators to make it work together. It is an obvious place for us to take action in relation to students with disabilities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205311	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205313	I think there might be some reasoning in one way or another. My point is, of course, just that I think that there are a lot of small things going on in people's everyday lives. However, I would still say that the training courses out there have the opportunity to act in relation to it, and we are actually spending a lot of resources on that. Already, for example, we have. the development projects from Student counselling, which is therefore a little more effort, especially on the basis of covid-19 and especially on the basis that people have felt abandoned at home.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205351	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Victoria Velasquez. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205352	Thank you. When we talk about the well-being of young people, we cannot ignore the fact that we are also talking about what kind of framework there is around young people, for example. in their degree programmes. And some of what we've been discussing a lot and where we've also done some good things in this period is about momentum. Compared to the result grant in the study time grant, it is quite clear that it is one of the driving elements. So I would like to hear the rapporteur's reflection that we are removing the last 5% where we can see that this has an impact on the fact that the progress reform is still going to be a joke and that we are pushing young people and students unnecessarily. Is that something you're positive about looking at removing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205440	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205441	Well, we do not reject in advance any changes to our whole system in advance, of course; we should not do so. But I think we should also look at the wider issue than that, also in relation to what is now of culture. For many students there is also a zero error culture, which actually makes you make quite high demands on yourself. Well, that is a challenge for the whole of society, and that is, of course, something that the individual must take on. But that is something that education can still help with out there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205520	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205521	Thank you. But part of that zero error culture comes from Christiansborg. I spoke, for example. with a student yesterday who is so pressured that he has to blank his exam in order to get some time to read, but who now has to, in relation to the exam that is coming, to have to pass. Because if you don't, you're just gonna get hit by these mechanisms. And it is, of course, a zero error culture that comes from legislation from Christiansborg. Then there are some other things that also come from Christiansborg. It is, for example, that you cannot get an exemption if you have some study-related work, and so would like to focus on some work • perhaps not have any study or study in reduced time. Should we not release a little in the university law so that you can better manage locally how you want to do it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205603	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205604	I think there are many good opportunities in terms of how we can look at the composition of the training itself. We will also be looking at this in the future, both in the short and in the long term, of course. I actually think there are several areas that could be looked at. We are already looking at an evaluation of the admission system from the outset. And, of course, it is clear that later we will also have to look at an opportunity to improve the well-being that is now for the students.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205638	Thank you very much to the Socialist rapporteur. There was a formal error in the read text, which was 16 words too long, speaking of this with pressure via a zero error culture. So I must ask the Socialist rapporteur to take part in an editing process and come up and read the text again at the end of the debate. The next speaker is the rapporteur of the Left. Mrs. Heidi Bank, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607205718	Thank you for that and thank you for having the debate in this Chamber today, which affects so many young people out there. Daily stress and massive loneliness should not be an ongoing part of life regardless of age. However, it is particularly alarming when children or young people are affected when life becomes incalculable and it can be difficult to find its way in everything you want to, and your own and others' expectations when everyone else's lives look perfect, because we do not always see what the facade covers. In the Left, we are now optimistic on behalf of our young people, our students. They contain so much good, so much will and desire for life. But we are also concerned because we can see that too many feel pressure in everyday life and stress and loneliness and too many mistrust. One out of every five students finds that this restricts them in their everyday lives. Words such as burnout and labor pressure and, above all, loneliness are put on it. Special attention is paid to how corona has affected young people, for young people are clearly so affected by a time when the physical study environment was replaced by the virtual and that was all too long with contact with few comrades and fellow students and cancelled social events at educational institutions and in the community. In short, it was all the places where young people meet and where there is extra pulse and good energy. In the Capital Region alone, the reference to children's and youth's psychiatry in the wake of corona has increased by 27%. The references are so serious, and among other things. stress, anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts take up. It calls for an active and quick action. This is about our young people, because there is a need for a healthy and active study environment. There is a need for communities and to create a study environment that embraces and benefits and that provides security and well-being for students. This is crucial for learning and professional development and socialisation, belonging and identity. We know that the individual educational institutions are aware and that they work with well-being and how they can support a good study environment. We know that they are also aware that more can be done. To do more requires sustained effort. Remediation requires something extra. How do we prevent too many people from dropping out? What about the ones on the edge? What about their families and relatives? When young people are miserable, the whole family is challenged. It's wearing out. Young people and their loved ones have waited far too long. The Left believes that action is needed now, not even in the autumn, but now. There is a need for concrete action. Therefore, we will require the government to call for real negotiations on a new 10-year plan for psychiatry by the end of July 2022. The government has promised and promised, but very little is happening. It creates insecurity and young students who do not receive the necessary help with the risk that the negative spiral will be worse than it had to be, with great human costs. That is why the Left wants something to be done now so that the new initiatives can be implemented, among other things. the country's educational institutions at the start of the semester, including meeting the need for a strengthened family effort, so that our young people quickly return to a good spiral and well-being with the opportunity to have an active leisure life with strong commitment communities and opportunities to meet other young people in social contexts. We believe that we can do better politically, and that is why we are sitting here today debating what we are doing. We also believe that we owe it to young people and to their families. Then I shall read out a text of adoption from the Left and the Danish People's Party: Proposals for adoption • Too many young people are disillusioned, and the distrust among this particular age group is markedly increasing. Especially corona, which restricted young people's freedom spaces, has given young people psychic bruises. This is particularly felt in children's and adolescents' psychiatry, to which young people are referred with stress, anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. It calls for active and rapid action. Young people's dissatisfaction, stress and loneliness clearly challenge not only the opportunities for education but also the opportunities for young people to have active leisure time with strong commitment social communities. The Danish Parliament points out that the government's high school agreement does not help the many vulnerable young people, as the agreement forces them out of their communities and social life. By the end of June 2022, the Danish Parliament is instructing the government to call for substantive negotiations on a new 10-year plan for psychiatry, so that new initiatives can be launched, inter alia: the country's educational institutions at the start of the semester. • V 104).
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210234	Thank you very much. There are some brief comments. First from Mrs Astrid Carøe, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210239	Thank you. I fully agree with the Left that we must do something in the field of psychiatry. It has simply gone far too slowly. But I would also just like to say that I think this area is much bigger than that. I mean, it's the weakest people, fortunately, who have to get into our psychiatry, and this is about some numbers saying up to half, isn't it? Fortunately, they're not going into our psychiatry. So I just want to hear what the Left is thinking: is it resolved with the psychiatry negotiations, or is there more to do?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210313	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210315	Thank you. It is the case that there is a great deal of work going on in educational establishments. We have already discussed some of this in this Chamber today, and there has been an answer to that, and the Minister has mentioned some of the things that are going on. We have also worked on some of the challenges of equality in our educational institutions in the committee where I am chairing the Equal Opportunities Committee. That is why there is already work going on today, and that is why I believe that many of the good initiatives that are needed know what is needed in reality. Well, it is not something where we try to push it far into the future; it is something where you can go in to look at what it is then that we can do. And one of the things we can actually see that needs to be done is to get an agreement for psychiatry, which means that some of those most affected out there can get some help. When I was reading some material here, I came across that 80%. of students seeking student counselling are to be compared with those for outpatient psychiatric treatment. Well, these are completely wild numbers that we're dealing with here. After all, we must not think that these are particularly weak young people, because there will be a great many young people in the numbers we see who are actually strong, healthy young people, but who are affected by the psyche and need us to do something more.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210437	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210439	Thank you. So what I have to understand is that we have to move on the psychiatry. We must also fully agree on this. But do we really think that the initiatives that are under way are enough, or how? Because I certainly do not agree with that at all. I don't think it can be said at all that if we just do things in psychiatry, we're like the goal. Because these are alarming figures, but it is not people who are going into psychiatry. These are people we need to help get a better student life. And one way we can do that is by putting the last momentum things into the grave, so that you will be able to adapt your education more individually than you can today. Will the Left be involved in this as an additional initiative in addition to the good initiatives that we have already launched?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210518	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210520	What I was trying to say is that I really think that we are parking something when I say that they already know what is going to happen out there. There are plenty of inputs coming in to us all the time about what it is of different solutions that can be made. That is why it is good that we should have this debate today. But I also think a little that we say: well, then we turn it over to some work that the government can do sometime in the autumn. We all know there's a choice right around the corner, maybe. Therefore, what we are focused on in the Left, so to speak, is what could be done now and here? That's one of them. to solve it with the fact that there are actually students and, indeed, perhaps, as the figures appear, more than we really want to be about who are having such difficulty that there is a need to give some extra help in the educational institutions to lift the measures that make it possible to get proper psychological guidance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210605	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Victoria Velasquez. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210608	Thank you. I would really like to know whether the rapporteur is aware that the cuts made in education by the Left have had some of the consequences that the rapporteur has mentioned in his speech. We can just see that it has had an impact on poorer feedback; that the teachers have fewer hours to help, teach and guide the students; and that it has also had an impact on how much study guidance you have been able to get and how much help you have been able to get. I mean, all these things are gonna help make the misfortune even bigger. Is the rapporteur of the Left aware of that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210646	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210648	Now it can be said that it is easy to question whether some of the cuts that have been made over the years have been made in the right places and whether proper priorities have been set. But it is also the case that it would be quite natural that in every organization, that is to say, if you talk business and everything else, you keep looking at what you can do better and how you can change something. That's what has also been in that saving, that's how you can do this differently, so you get more for the resources that are there. So I can't say that everything has just been the right way to go. On the other hand, I cannot say that it was all bad, because it is also a question of using the resources we have in the best way possible so that we can use them elsewhere.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210728	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210730	But if the money was not to be taken from feedback, from lessons or from study counseling or the parts, where is it that the money should be taken from? Because I have a little difficulty in seeing how it will not hit the individual student when the resources you give to the individual student get smaller and smaller. I would also like to hear: we know that there has been a shepherd's letter about those who are miserable and about those who have reduced their function, which requires universities to do some things. The economy is also being pointed out here. Would the Left with this knowledge be interested in actually promising that they won't cut their education again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210813	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210815	In the Left, we are happy to engage in a lot of dialogue, but that requires a call for negotiations on it. Our focus here is what we can solve before a choice, and what can we provide a framework for. And there we really think it would be a good idea for the Enhedslisten and some of the other parties to push more in terms of getting something done about what is in demand. We see that there is student counselling, where 80%. of those who come is in such a bad situation that it actually corresponds to being an outpatient psychiatric patient, that is, it is a huge problem. But I also hear from some of the other parties that you see as a problem, but it is also relevant to address it and deal with it, because some of them are the worst affected.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210858	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Katrine Robsøe from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607210902	Thank you. I can at least hear from the rapporteur from the Left that the Left is counting on a choice to be made, with the speech that has been delivered here. I am really a little sorry that it is being drawn up this way in this debate. I have not called the parties and gathered the parties so that this would be such a conflict debate for something else. I was actually hoping that we could have a discussion on some of the things that can actually be done in our field, in other words in the field of higher education. I don't see it as a contradiction to the other one at all. I would very much like to help push for negotiations to be held on health issues too, but I also think that we should look at the things we can do in the area of further education. That is why I want to hear why the Left does not want to be involved in making sure that we look at some of the things that we can actually do something about here. Because I certainly do not share the view of the Left that what they have to deal with in the institutions is something that we should not do anything about here. Things cost money, too. If we want to have more guidance for both study choices, but also to be able to find out how to be a student; if we want to make it easier to be a student along the way, then we need to take action on it. I really hope that the Left could contribute constructively to finding solutions there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211025	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211027	But then I do not think the rapporteur has quite heard what I have said. We would like to go in and discuss in debates some of the things that have been mentioned today. We think it is very serious. I also think that this is very clearly explained in my speech. The distrust there is, the loneliness there is, the stress there is, the pressure that many young people are experiencing, we take deeply seriously. I have children of 20 and 23 years of age myself. I meet their buddies. I am well aware of their reality. What this is all about is that we want to see action. That is actually what I see as Mrs Katrine Robsøe's wish. At least that's what I heard was also spoken about. However, we are just pointing out an area where we believe it will continue to be pickled and we think it is important that we take care of the psychiatry. We also believe that this is of enormous importance to the country's students.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211122	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211124	I do not disagree with the rapporteur from the Left. I just think it is really a pity that, when we have called for a question debate with the Minister for Education and Research, we cannot get the plug on and in a strong community pressure the government to take action in this area too, so that we do not just take it over to another ministry and so that we do not put it against each other, but actually get something done in all the areas where we can do something. And this is precisely where we have the opportunity to address the problem, which is also increasing among students in our higher education.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211201	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211203	Well, we're not gonna set up a partition, or we're gonna split it up. We just go in and point out something where we think that something could be started very, very quickly and where we think it is absolutely, absolutely necessary. It's on the psychiatry. I cannot understand why the rapporteur wants this division to be increased. As far as I know, the Minister for Education and Research is part of a government, so I hope that part of the matter of going in and telling us what the Minister sees as part of the challenge for the country's students is also about pressure on some work in the field of psychiatry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211240	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Astrid Carøe from the SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211248	Thank you. I think I would like to start by thanking Mrs Katrine Robsøe for bringing us together parties to stand together on this question. I think it is strong when we can stand together and, unfortunately, when we can make a broad adoption text, not with all parties, but with many parties, and when we called the question, there was also a broad consensus that it should be about the young people in higher education, but it could also be about our children and young people in youth education, because they do not thrive very well either. Nor have I prepared a text for adoption today that we need a new taximeter system for youth education, because it is the Minister for Education and Research that we have in the Chamber. There have never been so many young people who are distrustful, as today, and we have been able to confirm this time and again, even several times, from speakers up here from the platform today. One in three young women and one in five young men has low mental well - being, and at the same time one in two young women and one in three young men feel stressed. I'm not kidding. The good news is that we have got it mapped out and that we can act on it, but the bad news is that the spread of distrust and stress among young people has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. When we talk about youth distrust, we do not always know the reasons why young people feel stressed or have anxiety or depression. Therefore, we must also be able to dare to ask the difficult questions about what it is in our society that makes so many young people break and end up in disarray. Why is it so difficult to be a young person and a student today? While there is something that we do not know, I would also say that there is a lot that we know very well about what it is that is pushing. These are phenomena on social media, but they are also very much the 12th century hunt, the performance society and the perfection requirements that many feel they have to live up to. If you ask the students themselves, they also say that it is the character pressure, the academic level of the study and the time pressure, there are some of the reasons why they get stressed. I think we can do a lot here from Christiansborg. Some of this is about culture and the way we deal with it. If you ask us in the SF, then today society has structures that young people cannot stand. It starts from the crèche where children are sent more quickly in kindergarten, because there is money to save the municipalities by sending them from crèche to kindergarten earlier. It continues to be measured and weighed in primary and secondary school, and when the hat is on, and you think you should have a breathing space and a well-deserved summer holiday, then everyone will know: What are you going to do next? What do you want to be? It is therefore only time for young people to be allowed to settle down, both between their education and their education, and we must help them to do so. You have to feel like you're worth something, that you're good enough as you are. It is our most important task as a society to create an inclusive culture in a secure environment. If you ask us in SF, we need to have less focus on grades and more guidance, and we need to ensure much more flexibility in education systems. Why can't you take your youth education over a long period of time, for example? Have a diagnosis? Why is it so difficult for young people with diagnoses in higher education to have their education taken? I do not think we will find one solution, because then we would probably have found it, and I do not think I have all the answers, but I think that we can get closer and that we should, in general, make greater efforts to support a good framework in higher education in order to promote the well-being and communities of students. I think I will end by mentioning a few things. We have already mentioned it a little, but I think it is relevant that we should have a new admission system as soon as possible. It's been stuck in the brake for a while, and we've been asking for it for a long time. We also need a new grade scale. And then I think that we should have more flexibility and more feedback in the teaching and counselling services... that I think I could help the students. I have also asked about this a few times with the last remnants of the progress reform, and it is therefore due to the fact that, although we have put a great deal of it in here, it is still joking out there, especially because universities are very dependent on the economy of it, which means that there are people who are being pressured to take their education more quickly than they may need and who fit them. I've tried it myself. I was a student when I was elected to the Danish Parliament and I couldn't take a break and a break. I was supposed to continue to be a student, otherwise I passed to maximum study time. I finished my bachelor's degree, so it worked out, and it wasn't that big a problem for me, but it was a bigger problem for my friend who had just had a little child and had to finish her candidate, because she wasn't allowed to exceed the maximum period of study, despite having a small child at home. It's not necessarily something we have decided in here, it's the educational institutions, but we've set up a framework for the educational institutions that makes them make these rules because otherwise their finances will collapse. That is why I believe that we can do something from within culturally in the context of the drive reform. I don't think that's the solution to everything, but I'm just gonna put on the little extra curl, because you're still experiencing this out there, even if we've put some of it in the grave.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211801	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Katrine Robsøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211803	Thanks for a nice speech. I would really like to ask the SF's rapporteur a question about a welfare commission, because I know that SF back in 2018, I think it was, or perhaps it was in 2017, has proposed to do so in the field of children and education. Therefore, I would like to know whether SF might be able to take part in the idea that we could get something together here that could help to do something about the well-being of higher education • to gather some knowledge and look at what it is to a lot of different pieces that can help solve some of the challenges.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211839	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211840	Thank you. I certainly think so. The question is whether it should be two divided or whether it should be put together. I mean, I think we should do something, and I think we should put some smart people together, who can give us some answers as to what the opportunities are for increasing the prosperity. But I also think we need to see our education system together. We saw, for example, that the ceiling on education, which was actually in higher education, particularly pressured young people in high school, who thought: I must understand that. So things we decide in one area can have consequences for another in terms of well-being. So it may well be that it has to be thought together, but I am certainly not at all opposed to doing anything with a commission.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211923	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607211927	I am not opposed to that idea either. It may well be that we have to think in that direction. At least that's a good point. And I very much agree that you can never just see the education system split up in the same way as we do in here. I hope that I can open an open door here with the next question, namely whether we should not jointly ensure that when we discuss the admission system, we discuss a new grade scale at the same time, so that we do this together and also put some pressure together to get more guidance so that people actually have better conditions for choosing an education that is right for them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212005	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212007	Well, that's an open door that gets kicked in. This is something we have also proposed in several rounds. I think I will make one comment on the admission system, because I can also be worried that we will have something done in the opposite direction, and we just have to pay real attention to that when we create a new admission system. Because there are just places in our education system where we have tried to do something good for the students, and then it has turned out that it had the opposite effect. So we just need to make sure that it's thoroughly checked out. And I also think that we have already had some very good meetings on the admission system, and I hope that we can continue that discussion.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212041	Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Victoria Velasquez from the Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212051	Thank you for that, President. Thank you for taking the initiative that together we can do this joint question debate. This is especially true when it is that so many young people, students, walk around with stomach pain, palpitations, have sleeping problems or feel lonely, for then it is a wakeup call for society. It is quite clear that there is something that is wrong and on which action must be taken. That is true, a great many young people, and it is reflected in all parts of the education system and in society in general, among other things. and this is the focal point of this question debate on higher education. The proportion of students in mental distrust has increased, and it has increased over the last few years, even before the coronapandemic. We can see that one in three students feels very pressured among the new students, and more than one in three experienced loneliness in the study, and the development has only gone in the wrong direction. In the autumn of 2020 during the coronapandemic, almost half of the students felt lonely in the studio, and the latest figures after the corona crisis are also alarming. The new health profile figures here from 2021 show that there is a marked decrease in young people's mental health. 34 per cent of young women aged between 16 and 24 and 21 per cent. of men of the same age have poor mental health. Compared to the most recent health profile, there has been an 8 per cent increase in miscarriage. for both sexes. The figures also show that 52 per cent. of young women between 16 and 24 years of age report high stress levels, as do 31%. by the young men. That is all, too many, and we need to take that seriously. Unfortunately, it is not something that surprises you that we see the challenge of well-being both before corona and after corona, because a string of bad political decisions has been made that have pushed young people from various sides and that make it even harder to be young and students. I would just like to mention a few examples of this: it is the quadruple character requirement in order to be able to deal with training; it is about the gradual erosion of one's financial security. In 2021, non-resident students have seen how they have received almost 5,000 DKK. Very many people spend most of their money on paying their rent; then it is an economic system in the educational institutions which we have also touched on in some of the questions today, which are pressing for the institutions to push students through even more quickly if it is that students are delayed. And there are many good reasons to be delayed, as there is in no way any flexibility to be taken into account; then there are the years of savings in education that have left the students with far too few hours and get some feedback. The fact that the framework of education, and bypassing that, we see rising housing and food prices, a accumulated corona debt from decommissioning, where many lost their study jobs but could not receive financial help. On top of that, we are now looking into the fact that the day after tomorrow we will be witnessing a majority in here that will cut the graduation rate, and I can also be concerned that some people are going to consider whether the legal requirement should be removed, as the Reform Commission has proposed. This will mean that the fellow students will be turned into each other's competitors, and it will also help to push the throes. All these things put together, of course, help to make the picture complex, but also to make you pressured from various sides, both on the training courses and on the general framework that is for a young life. And that is an important point, we think, when we talk about it, because of course the poor economy, the housing situation has an impact on the fact that you have the profits to be able to immerse yourself in your studies. We must create the very best education and study environments, but it cannot be left alone, because if young people do not have a place where they can afford to live and have to work very much alongside their studies, they cannot be properly present in their education either. So summing up, we simply have to stop tripping young people, because the fact is that young people are strong and enterprising. Young people have come through the Corona crisis of distance learning and isolation, they have come through a decade of cuts in education and increasing inequality, and they have even led the fight for climate action and a fair world, and that is inspiring, and we must support that instead of tightening our feet. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212600	Thank you very much to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212611	Thank you, President. First of all, I would like to thank the Radicals for being the driving force behind this debate we are having today about the dissatisfaction of students in higher education. When you're out among the young, you have no doubt about how they feel. They tell it, because fortunately many people are open about the fact that it can be difficult to be young. Studies show it, the figures are clear, the reports tell it, and it's not fun to always be young. Stress and loneliness are part of everyday life. Many are looking for help, and fortunately many are good at it. The other day I heard something on the radio that surprised me. I heard that the post-schools have problems holding on to young people. I know that we are discussing higher education here, but this surprised me and I simply have to tell you. In the post-schools several young people have given up being there because they are unable to be in the community. I myself have had the pleasure of post-schooling, my children have had the pleasure of it, I think it is sad that for some it has become too difficult. We have to act on the fact that young people are having a hard time, we have to take care of them, because they deserve it. We need to build some scaffolding around those who make youth a good time for something to be remembered. In Silkeborg Municipality, where I also sit on the city council, we have tried to do a little. We do not have a lot of higher education, and of course we are sorry about that, but we want to take good care of those we have. We have made an offer to help them into society, we have a strong association life, and many have actually accepted the offer. When I was a student, I helped make a revue. It was amazing. It was fun. I don't know if the teachers thought it was funny, because of course they got one on the hat, but it gave a unique community, and I actually know some of the songs yet, but I'll spare you for them. However, we must ensure that study time is a time to remember with good memories, and some of what others have mentioned here today, about the scale of character, the admission system, etc., we would really like to enter into some negotiations, just as we think that counselling should fill something more, because when you are guided and more enlightened, you can make better choices.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212921	Thank you very much to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607212934	Thank you for that, President. It is, of course, an important debate we have now, as we have also had over a long time now, and there is no doubt that there are very many elements in this. The progress reform has sent some signals to students about the way to be students who have helped to create a culture that is not appropriate. I still think that the progress reform was justified at the time, because there were some cultures that we should have pushed on. Now all we have to do is return to the fact that as a student you are also a student and not a student, because that is actually what the progress reform said. It set some square frames and said that now you show up here, then you come to your exam, then you do what you're told. And then you get used to not having to think for yourself to be a student, but you have to, and it's really important. The educational ceiling sent a signal, which was taken down by a great many students, which was now something that could not be done. Thousands and thousands of young students experienced it, although the number actually affected by it was very, very small. But again, it pushes into a culture, it pushes into an experience that has had a negative effect. That's why it's important to look at all these elements. The perfection culture can also be mentioned, social media, what they do to the students' experience of having to take an education and compare with others and keep up with others and the expectations that come. So how do we get it done better? Well, of course, it is something to ensure a better expectation vote, it is to become clearer, to make better admission criteria or admission systems, so that as a student you are actually guided to get an understanding of what it is all about. For those expectations come a long way from the students themselves, but when they come in the students' heads, they come of course, because some of the other things that have happened over time that have been created from in here help to create the images. However, I must say that at one point I had two 8th-class girls visiting me who were writing a report about their experience of stress and well-being, and they experienced themselves as pressured, they had a huge expectation pressure, but then when you talked to them a little about where they thought it came from, it wasn't their parents, it wasn't their teacher either, it was primarily themselves. It was their very clear picture when they had to say it themselves, but they also thought it was a problem that they felt that way. Then I think that it is not just us as parents who have to do things differently, so it is very much also a question of creating a framework for those cultures. I have tried to take up the discussion in the past in relation to social media and what it does to the young people and to all of us for that matter, but to a large extent by the young people in relation to their experience of what the demands are, what they are reflected in. So instead of saying that you are good enough as you are, what I really think is what you should tell all children and young people, tell them to do as well as they can, because then, as a society, we are really happy. But that is not good enough from the young people's point of view. So better expectation reconciliation, recording systems, grades, the way to deal with grades, we can talk about. Characters are really important. In fact, there are also studies which indicate that those who come from less educational homes are actually very fond of grades and are very comfortable with grades, because they can relate to them. So we must also be careful that we do not remove some things that are actually good in some contexts. But getting the dialogue and talking about how we can work on this is, of course, really important. Then there are those groups that really need extra help, where we need the psychiatry to be in place too, and of course we also need that part. It is important for those in the large groups where it is the great culture that we have to work with, and I hope we can do that together. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607213340	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no brief comments. And so the trip has come to the Minister of Education and Research. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607213352	Thank you. Thank you, too, for many good speeches in the discussion here and one, I can tell you, joint efforts to want to see among the young people in Denmark not as much as today, groups and people who are affected by distrust in various degrees. I cannot go into every speech that has been made in this way, but I would still like to make some cuts and make some comments. First of all, there are many who, I think, support what I also tried to say in my introductory speech, namely that something is about the education system, and we, as rapporteurs and politicians here, can do something about that, but what we see in the experiences that young people bring about is also coming from many other parts of society, and that some of the phenomena we see also reflect problems that are more general in our society and among our young people. Mrs. Katrine Robsøe began, I think, with many good considerations about what it is all about, i.e. a culture of perfection, an experience of trying to be a success on all parameters all the time: that it should go well in your studio, that you should have the right job, that you should want to have a boyfriend and lots of friends. Social media are mentioned, and there are always some who have had a cooler day than you when you open Facebook out on the evening, right? And if that is what meets you all the time, and what you are also being struck by, then it is clear that there will be a feeling of inadequacy and of not being able to live up to it by being perfect, successful and looking good all the time... none of us can. So of course it also affects many of the young people who report these kinds of distrust or insecurity or whatever it may be. I would like to refer some figures from the Danish Study Survey for how it has been in recent years. The latest figures from 2021 show that 74 per cent. Says: I generally feel very comfortable with my education. 79% Says: I can get help and support from my fellow students when I need it. 74 per cent Says: There is a good social environment on my education. 83% Says: There is a good professional environment on my education. All these figures have deteriorated over the last three years and are to some extent also marked by corona, and it is not at the same level as it was before. Politically, we have actually slowed down the annual savings made under the previous government, with progress reform, training ceilings and other things that have been mentioned. But Corona and, I think, the general development of society are the hallmarks of these figures, which are not really very bad in themselves. In fact, there are many who provide excellent feedback here; there are some excellent feedback levels here for how you assess that you are feeling or how the environment is on your education. However, in all cases they have deteriorated over recent years, and of course we need to take this seriously, take stock of it and keep a close eye on it, and we need to make sure that the efforts we are making move the other way, with the grip we can now, in the field of education. But when I say that, it is also because I think that there is also a need for a debate now that we have talked through a long debate about many of the problems that we are careful not to get a whole generation of young people sickened, because that is not the case either. Many young people are therefore extremely committed, knowledgeable and talented, but are in a way also affected by the need to be perfect in all areas all the time and may be affected by a sense of inadequacy. But on the other hand, it is also important, I think, that we do not sicken them. With regard to those who really feel this way and who really also need psychiatric help, I agree that this is extremely important and probably also a under-debate part of our health services over a long period of time. So it's not my resort, but I just want to remind you that there was it on the last or the previous Finance Act? kr. More to psychiatry. The Minister of Health is working on a 10-year plan and has a dialogue with the Danish Parliament's parties. However, I think it was perhaps the wrong speech that the rapporteur of the Left had made today, or the wrong rapporteur who had been sent, because I had the same experience as Mrs Katrine Robsøe that we really have a constructive discussion here about what we can do to reduce distrust, but that the election campaign has just started for the Left. Yes, that may not have been the most constructive way to go about it. And may I remind you, as Mrs Velasquez has said, that we have stopped the annual savings on education that took place under the previous government, which, as Mrs Velasquez has said, has barely made any profits on the institutions for guidance and feedback and for teaching forms where one is closer to one's teachers, instead of major lecture halls, etc.; the challenges have hardly been improved by the course that was under the previous government if I just briefly have to replicate on it. And then I will return to some of the more constructive attempts to address this discussion. These questions about expectation pressure and social media are one of the points raised by the Danish People's Party's rapporteur, Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl. As I said, I think that is very true. Mrs Gitte Willumsen has raised this issue of association, and I would really like to support that, and I have done so in a recent speech at a conference on how voluntary association and education can play together in order to increase the well-being of young people. Being involved in society at all I think is very edifying for all people, and having something next to your study or next to your work where you are human in a different way than in the function of student or employee, I think is very good. And it can be with other students, but it can also be in society at all, as Mrs Gitte Willumsen has said. So I would also like to call on you today to cooperate with society. I was in my speech about the recording system. It has been stressed by several rapporteurs that we are very interested in moving forward. I take that on board, and I look forward to calling the rapporteurs for discussions on it. As I was revealed in a reply to Mrs Katrine Robsøe, I have also had various students and representatives of the student movement inside to provide assessments of some of the issues that we have had on the agenda in our thematic meetings and which I think we will also get up to in our political discussions. I hope to be able to do that soon. There are many other points about how to organise education, guidance, etc., which I also think are relevant. We can work with the funds we have as an educational institution and other major efforts, of course, it will require that we can find funding for which I do not have immediately, but we as a party are welcome to continue to press for priority to be given to the places where it is possible to negotiate. Finally, I would like to say that a genuine Commission on well-being does not have the government right on the drawing board; it is another element that has been mentioned in the debate. There is also a risk that it might become too isolated in the field of higher education, in relation to the fact that this whole debate may also reflect some other challenges in our society. However, in relation to a number of the points that were also mentioned by the Socialist rapporteur on welfare-enhancing projects in education, welfare-enhancing development projects in Student counselling and various initiatives at educational institutions in connection with covid-19, I would like to say that we are supposed to pick up on the experiences that have been made in all those places and that we can hopefully gain some experience from that, in terms of what we can do more of things that have had a beneficial effect. Should there be more than that? I will not deny that at all. However, I would just like to announce that we will actually have some experience here, even without setting up a new Commission, which we will be able to take stock of politically. Part of this is about covid-19, and I would like to say that it is of course something that was really hard for many and, as I said, I think it is also reflected in the fact that some of the figures I mentioned before have gone down. But I also think that we need to say to each other on top of the round we went through, that it will also be an example of something we actually did. Even though it was hard, it was something that we managed as a society and as citizens and as a student, and the fact that you can actually overcome some major challenges is, in fact, one of the things that can help lift you and make a more robust and give a belief in yourself as a human being. So on that positive note, in addition to all the challenges we have, I think we can also say to each other that we actually do a lot of things and let us be raised together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214402	Thank you. There are a number of brief remarks. First, it's Mrs. Katrine Robsøe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214407	Thank you. For many of us, I think, it has been a very good and constructive debate that we have had today, but we are also in the Assembly, so I would just like to follow up on what the Minister said, since we in the other parties can push for money for the area if we think it is important. We think this is important, but after all I also have a hope and an expectation that the government, which is based on a paper of understanding, which talks about increasing the prosperity of children and young people, also believes that this should be promoted. So, during this last year, is the Social Democratic Party in case the rapporteur of the Left is not right in saying that the elections are just above and above some things you want to promote in this area without the rest of us perhaps pressing for it a long time before?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214507	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214509	Indeed, as I have said, various initiatives have already been taken during the parliamentary term, including those involving important economic priorities. All these funds have not yet been used, but they can continue to be used, and that will also lead to the gathering of experiences from several of them which we will be able to use further. A very specific point is also the work on the recording system, which plays a role for many things, but which hopefully can also be improved in a way that helps address this problem of distrust. That's not what can solve it all, but it's an element among several.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214601	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214603	I just think I need to get the Minister to elaborate on what money it is that is coming back and that we can then start doing well with. It would be very nice to know what kind of funds it is and also how many we are talking about. Because it could be nice for the other parties here, too, yes, for all of us if we have some money to implement some initiatives to promote the thriving, to make our education better, so to know what kind of funds we are talking about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214638	Thank you, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214640	It is a good thing that I have the follow-up question, because we do not have any additional funds here. In the past, however, quite large amounts of money have been set aside for the management of corona to promote well-being in various parts of the institutions. If they were not all used immediately, what they did not do, then it is not someone who has disappeared from there, but it is not new funds that we have for distribution between the parties here. Now the President is standing up, so in conclusion I would just like to express my agreement that it has been first and foremost constructive and good. And I look forward to working further with the parties to address the issue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214716	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Astrid Krag. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214721	Thank you. Yes, you cannot exactly accuse this question of being an election campaign question, because we are very much in agreement that something should be done in this area, and I think that is actually a good thing. Because I like it when it cannot be heated debates, but that we can also get closer to what we can agree on, as we do together. I am also very pleased that the Minister, just as he emphasizes where things are going well and where the figures are good, is going in the wrong direction, and it is very clear that we really must take seriously. I am also very pleased that the Minister emphasizes that we should not sicken our young people, and it was a great deal of will that I did not mention that we, for example. had received free psychological assistance for young people. I think it is fantastic, but when there is a need for free psychological assistance, the damage has already been done in some way, and what we are also very concerned about is how to prevent it. Of course it has to be free to get help if you get sick, but most of all we have to go somewhere, how far, much less need that help, and I think that we are doing very well together in this area. But what I would like to ask is when the Minister imagines that these negotiations on the admission system are going to happen. Because I do not think we have heard that quite clearly from the Minister this evening.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214832	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214834	No, that's right, I admit it blankly. I have not put time on that in what I have mentioned here, but it is still my hope and expectation that it will happen here before we go on a summer break, and it is for a first discussion. We're not gonna finish it, but we can start it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214848	Here you go, a follow-up note.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214854	What a pleasant surprise, because I thought the Minister would say that we should not start until after the summer break, but it is wonderful if we can get started already before. Another area, which is very much in line with the admission system, because the admission system is pushing young people on their average grade, is this, too, with a desire for a new scale of characters, and we would very much like to see the two things being parallel, i.e. negotiating a new admission system and a new scale of characters more or less in parallel. I know that the rating scale is different from that of the minister, but is it possible to reveal what the government has in the pipeline in relation to a new grade scale?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214928	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607214930	Mrs Astrid Carøe is right that this is not my resort. That is why I will not go into it in detail, but then just say again what I think we agree on, so there are some obvious challenges with how it has a description of the steps that are very much about subtracting. Instead of showing how well you handled some things, there is such a very negative way of doing it, and it must certainly be included, and it is important to me that we change it, and I would like to say that here. But otherwise, I think it is right that the Minister for Children and Education should answer questions about the scale of grades.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215013	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Heidi Bank. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215018	Thank you. In fact, I think it is quite crazy that there is a minister saying that the Left has sent the wrong rapporteur. I am actually a little surprised that it is not taken down enormously constructively, that the Left actually points out some of what the Danish Students' Joint Council has also been out to tell that there is a need. We need to look at the psychological help that our young students can get and how they also get better access to clinical assistance. That's what we're trying to talk about. We also agree that all sorts of other elements must be looked at and that we must listen to what they are doing in the educational establishments. But let it go. What I really want to ask the Minister is about the Reform Commission: can the Minister point out some concrete steps in the work that Nina Smith and the Commission have done, which the Minister believes will be quite concrete in relation to the well-being?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215114	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215116	When I said, as I did, it is because the Left, although I think that the Left has very, very little to have a criticism of the government and of what has happened in this parliamentary term, in a very confrontational way in a discussion where, I think, we have been trying quite constructively to find out what we agree on where we see some problems and how we can address them. I stand here with the text adopted by Mrs Heidi Bank, which is about the government doing too badly under the Corona, although we are probably among the countries that have handled it best; that the high school agreement, which has nothing to do with this debate on higher education, should be quite terrible for vulnerable young people. I disagree with the description, and I do not think it has anything to do with the discussion we have here, but it is still included in the text of the adoption that the Left is making. Finally, there is a point about a 10-year plan for psychiatry which deals with something for which the Minister for Health is responsible. That is what today is about the Left. That must then be either the wrong speech or the wrong rapporteur. We are simply doing something different from what the rest of us are doing. It's very clear to me.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215226	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215229	I can see now that the Minister did not choose to answer my question, but I hope the Minister will do so in his next reply. I think that all the things we put on our young people help to create well-being and have an impact on how they feel about their education. It may be that the Minister does not see a connection, but I think that much of what has been mentioned, among other things. by the rapporteur on the Radical Left, precisely the many, many different elements are helping to influence it. I actually heard the Minister praise Mrs Katrine Robsøe for that. Maybe it's just that it's someone from the Left who says it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215302	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215304	I reacted in my previous reply to the fact that it would, as it were, be too bad for me to have criticised the contribution of the Left and I think I have explained why I did so. On the second question, which is what I assume one would have liked to have had an answer to in the first brief remark, I would say that I think it is of course exciting what the Reform Commission has come up with, but we are not in favour of converting the Su on Master's degree programme into loans which were the policy of the Left. I do not know if it still is, but the Left has already proposed it in the last parliamentary term. Then I think there are some thoughts about the recording system, for example. That quota 2 is not working as intended today, and that is right. This could be some of what we discussed in the discussions on the recording system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215347	Thank you. The next question is Mrs Victoria Velasquez from the Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215351	Thank you. I'd like to address this part about not having to mess with a whole generation of kids. I am also thinking of these figures, of course, that we must always take it seriously when some people feel bad that the reason why it should in any case make the alarm bells ring politically is that it is an indication that there is a structural problem. When we see that, far more than it used to be in a generation, we see these things, there's something structuralally quite wrong. There we have a responsibility on the part of Christiansborg. There I think it might be exciting to hear a little about the question today about how the government will work with it. In relation to this framework, which is around study life in higher education, it is so that something could be done about, for example. the requirement for maximum study time or the automatic admission to the first year's examination or the thesis or the financial system that we have talked about how to do it, so that the programmes are financially motivated to press the students • or other things you could do that would enable us to strengthen the well-being and remove some of the distrust among the students?
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215503	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215504	Of such structural regulatory things, there are, for example: what we have talked about sometimes, about the admission system and also the character system. Although I cannot go into it much now, these are examples of things we can do politically. I am also always open to a discussion on the other issues raised by Mrs Victoria Velasquez here, but it is not something where I can give an immediate undertaking that we are changing some of those things here. I would like to repeat the nuance I tried to give in my previous answer, namely where people have previously experienced someone who did not really move on or got stuck in the thesis or whatever it was, and that was not a good situation either. As a society and responsible for the economy, we must also try to find the balance between giving a certain space and flexibility to live life and being exposed to different things while you are a student, and that we are also interested in completing our education, moving on, experiencing a progression with the confidence that it also gives you that you actually experience progress.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215613	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215616	The reason why I did not just ask about this is that we are going to be included in the system, which is also very much the character of the recording system, is that we know that these negotiations are coming. Of course, we can discuss when, and then we wait for some other things in the government to settle down, or what do I know we can discuss that. But I am also interested in what follows, because it has a huge significance. I certainly hope that this is something the government will help to look at and then perhaps also look at what other things you can do to get people to finish their thesis on time. Because we can see that people are falling from the fact that people are being delayed, so this economic incentive is not enough, in fact it can sometimes have negative consequences.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215658	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215700	Thank you for the comments and suggestions that I will take as such. And again, the latter I just interpret as a way of saying that the framework of writing thesis and the instructions along the way are also places that you might want to improve on. It was absolutely not to be cheeky or to push the ball on to others that I said in my previous answer that it could also be something you take up. But it's just to make the open realization that I like many things where I can see that we can do more, but it's also a question of the financial framework, and they become narrower in these years, and we're going to have to have to prioritize within the space we now have.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215737	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215742	Thank you. I would also like to thank the Minister for reminding us that not all young people feel ill. In fact, there are a great many who are doing well, as the Minister also mentioned. And thank you for welcoming my proposal on association life, which I believe can contribute to this agenda of well-being. Then the SF's rapporteur came before me about the negotiations on the recording system, so I would like to ask something else. Will the Minister at some point invite us to discuss together this matter of well-being in such a more confidential space so that we can come closer to some solutions? After all, the Reform Commission offers some suggestions in their report.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215830	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215832	Thank you for your comments at the beginning of the speech. And yes to pick up on these various well-being projects and initiatives that have been at the educational institutions; so pick them up and review them to see if there is any obvious experience here that we can take with us. This is something I would like to call the rapporteurs to at a relevant time, and this is probably a time in the autumn of this year.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215910	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215911	Thank you. We will look forward to that. It might also be useful for a new rapporteur such as myself to have a list of what initiatives have been set in motion. It is difficult to have an overview of such a large complex area. I also think that there are others who might benefit from seeing what is really in good shape, because then it is easier to see where we can find some holes that each of us can fill out a little.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215940	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607215941	Thank you. But both in relation to some of the figures I have referred to here and what else lies with suitable data and some of the projects under way, which Mrs Gitte Willumsen would also like to have an overview of, I would certainly like to provide it to the committee. Ask the relevant committee question and I will see to it that this information is passed on to the committee and can be something that everyone here can benefit from for the further discussion on the matter. Of course I'll see to that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607220011	Thank you very much to the Minister for Education and Research. No one else has asked for the floor. We are now going to the second round, where Mr. Kasper Roug of the Social Democrats will come up here and among other things. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words about the proposal for adoption, which now amounts to 150 words or less, as the formal rule prescribes. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607220032	Thank you, Mr President. Sometimes when your heart is filled with words, it spills out on the text, and then the text suddenly becomes too long. The last 16 words I think we've found now. I will read the text again: Proposals for adoption • A majority of Parliament's parties are concerned about the growing dissatisfaction among young people today. 19% of higher education students state that they always or often experience strong symptoms of stress in their everyday life in the programme. We want a society and a culture where as many people as possible are well, and a culture of education with a focus on empowerment, education, learning and well-being. The parties note that several efforts have been made to promote the well-being of students, among others. by actively thinking well-being and learning into the framework of higher education institutions, and funds have been allocated both before and during the covid-19 closures. The majority see youth distrust as a serious and complex social problem requiring sustained focus and action. Therefore, the majority expect the government to follow up today's question by autumn 2022 with discussions on possible actions. • V 105). Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607220149	Thank you very much to the rapporteur. May I have the text so that it can be included in the further negotiations? Thank you. I actually thought it sounded like exactly 149 words. Thank you. In conclusion, I would like to give the floor to the rapporteur for the authors of the motion for a resolution to round off. Mrs. Katrine Robsøe from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607220213	Thank you for that and thank you very much to all the rapporteurs and the Minister for the debate. I'm really glad we could have this tonight. I really think that with all the speakers we have been very well elucidated, how complex a challenge we are facing and how many elements we are dealing with, why there are so many things we have to juggle with there. We have a political responsibility from in here to actually act on the basis of the worrying figures we see and the developments that are going on and are going on for a few years now. I think that a great many good things have come out in the debate. I very much agree with Mrs Gitte Willumsen about the fact that our associations can also help to make sure that you feel that you are part of a community, both outside and within the walls of our educational institutions. I think it is really important that we talk about flexibility, as both the SF and the Enhedslisten have said, in terms of giving the individual the freedom to be able to put together his own education. Because we have different prerequisites for what we can and how we can take our education when we get started on it. But I also think it is important to remember that being in education is also about being part of a community. When you enter an educational establishment, there are a lot of people who need to become part of a community. I can admit that I probably wouldn't have gotten through the studio if I hadn't had all my good fellow students. When a trade was just a bit sluggish, and when there was a trade I wasn't the best at, they were there to make sure it was fun anyway. Having a study group helped to make sure that I understood what was a little difficult in the first place. So it's about the community and the freedom to choose for yourself. These are the two things that I believe we must try from in here to find a good framework in which to be able to promote even more. That is also why we have written in the text of the adoption here kindly but certainly that we expect to be convened by the autumn at the latest for discussions on this in the Ministry. Because I meet a minister who, in fact, I still hope is interested in finding solutions and acting in relation to this challenge. I believe that we can do this together, and I very much hope that we can also work together here to get them involved, namely young people, and to hear them about how we are going to solve the challenges they face and how we are going to make their daily lives and their places of education better and a better place to be. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607220510	Thank you very much to the radical rapporteur. No one else has asked to speak, and so this debate is over.
ParlaMint-DK_20220607220522	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Wednesday 8 June 2022, kl. 13.00. I refer to the agenda that will appear on the Danish Parliament's website.
