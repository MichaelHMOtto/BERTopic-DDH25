ParlaMint-DK_20220126130111	The first question is to the Foreign Minister of Sikandar Siddique, Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130122	Go to Sikandar Siddique to read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130129	Thank you to the President and thank the Minister for coming on short notice. We witnessed the ethnic cleansing...
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130143	Excuse me, sir. Sikandar Siddique, in the first place you just read the question itself. Sikandar Siddique I do. ) Thank you, for then it is the Minister's turn, and then Mr. Sikandar Siddique just saw the question itself, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130158	Then we start with the question. Will the Foreign Minister explain whether the Government considers that humanitarian intervention may be necessary to stop the ongoing...
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130209	Excuse me, sir. Sikandar Siddique. What I see you reading now is Question No. 2 on the agenda. The question that has been asked as No. 1 According to my papers, will the Foreign Minister explain how the government is dealing with the escalating unrest that has occurred over the past six months in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is there a mistake in this? Sikandar Siddique There are errors in that). Is that the question that has been left out, so that is Question No 1? 2, we need answers to? Sikandar Siddique Yes). Is the Secretary of State prepared for that? The Foreign Minister Yes, I am prepared to do so). Good.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130236	Now, I think we've done all the middle bills, and Mr. Cole... Sikandar Siddique read question No. 2 on the agenda?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130245	Okay, so we will try again: will the Foreign Minister explain whether the government considers that humanitarian intervention may be necessary to stop the ongoing conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to avoid a repeat of the humanitarian disaster that struck the region in the 1990s?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130303	Minister of Foreign Affairs, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130305	Thank you, sir. Sikandar Siddique to raise this important question. For the time being, this is not a humanitarian crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but a political crisis. It is not an armed conflict either, but a political conflict. That is why it is far too early to start talking about humanitarian intervention. The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is critical, indeed very critical, but for the time being it is the political sabre raging of Republika Srpska. The leader of the Serbian entity, Milorad Dodik, has previously threatened with secession. So far, that threat has gone on. The humanitarian disaster that struck the country in the 1990s was the result of a terrible and bloody civil war, and that is quite simply not the situation we are seeing today. This does not mean that we should not take the situation very seriously, and I can assure you that the situation in the country is being monitored very closely here, in Brussels, in Washington. And if there is a need to put further pressure on Milorad Dodik and Republika Srpska, then I will work for that to happen; that is of course clear. But we must also remember that Bosnia and Herzegovina is an independent state. In 1995 the international community could twist the arms of the Bosnian leaders to bring an end to a terrible and bloody civil war. That is not the situation we are facing today. The Bosnian leaders must together find a way out of the present morass, and this will probably require a new constitution, electoral reforms and this is something that the European Union has been calling for for for a long time. However, the initiative must also come from the Bosnian leaders themselves. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130457	Sikandar Siddique, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130459	But we were all witnessing the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. 100,000 people lost their lives, millions were driven on the run, and the offensive and genocide in Bosnia did not stop until NATO intervened when it was militarily stopped. Today, as the Minister has also explained here, we are again seeing an escalation in rhetoric, an escalation in relation to mobilization. We see that the Serbian separatists in Bosnia are once again demanding secession, but they are also in contact with Russia, Hungary, Serbia, and this is of course of concern to the Bosnian people, but it is also of concern to the international community. And we must not see the situation escalate and watch passively, so we will again end up where we were in the 1990s. That is why I would like to ask the Minister: is this a priority for the Danish Government and has the government done something so far? Is the Danish Government in contact with e.g. the Bosnian Government? Is the government in contact with e.g. the Serbian Government, which also plays a key role in this? Is the Minister planning to take the initiative so that we can prevent a possible humanitarian disaster and a conflict?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130627	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130628	Thank you. The Dayton Agreement, which provided for the division of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was an important agreement to settle the terrible ethnic-religious civil war that was then in 1995. We are now in favour of 26 years ago, an agreement which was intended to be temporary and which would then be followed by constitutional reforms, electoral reforms, so that a genuinely functioning state, Bosnia and Herzegovina, could be established. That is what we are pushing for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130704	Sir. Sikandar Siddique, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130705	That's very good, but we just mustn't ignore the signals that are out there right now. We must not ignore the mobilisation, the rhetoric that we see from the separatists in Bosnia and from the Serbian Government. So I would like to end by asking the Minister: will the Minister guarantee to the many worried Bosnians that if the situation escalates further, Denmark will take the initiative and enter into a conflict?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130739	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130740	I can guarantee that we are doing everything we can, together with our partners in the European Union, together with the international community, together with our American allies, together with all the forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina that would like to settle and move forward from the ethnic and religious tensions that exist, in order to have real reforms, electoral reforms, in order to build a viable Bosnia and Herzegovina state that respects the rights of the various ethnic groups. That is what we are working hard on with the European Union. We are also ready to use sanctions if, for example, we are prepared to use sanctions. Dodice or anyone else doesn't do what we ask.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130815	Thank you. There's one last question for Mr. Sikandar Siddique. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130817	I believe that the Minister has included in the last part of his reply the fact that sanctions are ready to be applied. In any case, I can tell the Minister that the Free Greens will be watching this conflict, and the many worried Bosnians who are currently addressing us, we therefore believe in the Free Greens that we should take seriously. We must not end up in a situation as we did in the 1990s. And yes, we're not there right now, but the rhetoric and mobilization and the contacts and what's going on down there require us to have a watchful eye on this internationally.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130858	Minister of Foreign Affairs, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130900	Yes, everything, sir. Sikandar Siddique has just said, I fully agree, and that is why we are working hard to build a viable reformed Bosnia and Herzegovina which can overcome ethnic and religious tensions and where people can live together in peace and security. We are doing this very actively with our EU partners, with the Americans and here in Denmark, and I myself have also personally met with the Bosnian community here in Denmark, which is also very active in helping here. So we are in complete agreement on the objective.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130926	Thank you. The question is closed, thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and thank you, Mr President. Sikandar Siddique. We move on to the next question, which concerns the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply, and now the questioner is Mr. Lars Christian Lilleholt, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130941	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130942	Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126130958	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131000	The questioner and, incidentally, my predecessor in the post at the time, it was also called the Ministry of Energy, Supply and Climate; now it is called the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Supply, but it was the same area of responsibility that points to something very important here. Unfortunately, we still have too much dependence on natural gas in Denmark, and this applies to some district heating customers, about 40,000 if I do not remember much wrong, and to a much larger number of individual gas customers in Denmark who have individual gas pine, and that is hundreds of thousands we are talking about here. And, of course, something needs to be done. It is about a climate effect that we would like to achieve, of course. Natural gas is fossil fuel. But of course it is also about making ourselves independent, and of course it is also something that needs to be seen in the context of our overall strategy that we in Denmark want to shut down the extraction of oil and gas in the North Sea by 2050, and that is why it is of course part of the government's overall strategy, just as it has also been a major part of the energy agreement of which the author's party is fortunately a part and which we made last year.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131116	Lars Christian Lilleholt, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131116-2	Thank you, sir. Minister, and thank you for a good answer to a difficult question. What concerns us, of course, and why we are asking this question, is that we will push a little in relation to that process. Are there such political considerations in relation to the fact that this is now being looked at? I am also thinking of this in relation to the high gas prices, which affect not least the 300,000-400,000 households which have individual natural gas and which are located in areas which are relatively heavily burdened, one can well say where they see both the electricity price rising and the price of natural gas rising. The annual price of natural gas is almost sevenfold over the last year, and I have a feeling that this is something that concerns both my own party and, above all, the Minister's party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131207	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131208	Thank you for that, and it is certainly a pressure that I welcome. For it is clear that the solutions we have to make on the part that is about organising our energy policy, so we get rid of natural gas, I hope that we will do together what we have done so far. In fact, the schemes we have made also mean that there are much more people going to use district heating these years, including district heating, which is not based on natural gas, which is of course the vast majority. Fortunately, this also means that thousands of Danes will have their oil pine replaced, and indeed their gas pine with the support of the public, because we have agreed on this together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131243	Lars Christian Lilleholt, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131244	Thank you for your answer. I am also wondering whether, through a dialogue with possibly Danish District Heating and other actors, there are some possibilities that you might be able to ignore at a faster pace some of the limitations that exist today in relation to being able to replace an individual natural gas boiler with district heating.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131302	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131304	Fortunately, in the agreement we have made with the Left, we have also actually removed a great many of the obstacles that could be and the things that made it more troublesome. If there are other good ideas, I'd be happy to listen. We are only prepared for it to take place as cheaply and as painlessly as possible out there where you want it. However, as I have said, we have made it a lot easier here in recent years.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131334	Here I forgot to announce that there are co-questions on, and that is there. Because now it's the co-questioner. It's sir. Carsten Kissmeyer. Here you go. One minute.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131339	Thank you. However, following on from the previous question, I would like to make it quite clear that the arrangements we have for phasing out have given rise to some challenges with the fact that there has been a queue and that it has actually been difficult to get through and that it may cause some dents. Does the Minister have any other thoughts on how to speed up the phasing-out, where bureaucracy was less? Could it, for example? Is it a tax credit when you replaced your natural gas guy for a district heating solution or alternatively for a heat pump?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131424	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131426	No, I don't think we're about to start inventing a new model of payout. Now I have not heard that proposal in detail before, but I will immediately intuitively think that it will be at least as bureaucratic, perhaps even more bureaucratic. I think we should look at it in such a way that we are so fortunate that there is a broad political majority in Denmark to spend even very large amounts of money supporting Danes who would like to switch from oil or natural gas to individual heat pumps. You have really good opportunities to apply in different pools in Denmark, even a lot of money, and fortunately it works really well. It is clear that when there is something that is a success, and there are a lot of people who are looking for it, it also has the inherent challenge in it that there is pressure on the systems. It is clear that none of us think that anyone should be in line or that there should be problems with that. But it is also my clear impression that it has been dealt with and that it should work far better in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131525	Carsten Kissmeyer, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131526	A tax credit will not now present significant challenges bureaucratically. Would it be possible to encourage municipalities and heating companies to launch a campaign in which they say that we believe that district heating is coming, so that users knew more about what they were looking forward to?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131545	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131547	Well, the Left is welcome to include the proposal in the conciliation circle on how we would rather do things than the way we have done it so far. This is the first time I have heard the proposal, including in the negotiations we have had. Although I do not normally quote from the negotiating table, I think it is fair enough that I say this. It's a new idea. And bring the final one into the circle if you think it can solve a problem. I must say now that I am actually quite happy that we have a system in which some funding can be allocated quite quickly and flexibly to those areas where there is a need.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131622	Thank you. Then it's the main questioner, sir. Lars Christian Lilleholt, for the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131633	Thank you for that, President. Years ago, a global heating plan was drawn up for the whole of Denmark. It was done in cooperation with the municipalities, which is of course a local heat plan authority. Sometimes I have thought that it would not really be possible to consider whether an overall plan should be drawn up for district heating and where it makes sense to develop with individual electric heat pumps etc. Are these considerations being considered? It can be said that not least the current crisis of natural gas and energy in general makes us wonder whether such overall planning should not be carried out with the CO2
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131715	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131716	Immediately, I like the idea, and I am absolutely sure that we will enter into very close dialogue with the municipalities towards the energy and supply initiative we will be making in the spring. Having said that, however, there is also the factor to take into account that there must be some room for manoeuvre. I think so, and I am sure the questioner will agree with me to also plan out there locally, where you have knowledge of what is going on. Quite a lot of places in Denmark are actually quite entrepreneurial when it comes to finding new solutions. Odense, as we both know well, is a pretty good example of how you've really worked hard to make this transition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131750	Thank you. The question is over. We'll continue with the same crew, I almost said. Now it's sir. Carsten Kissmeyer, who is the main questioner, and Mr. Lars Christian Lilleholt, who is a co-questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131759	Sir. Carsten Kissmeyer for reading the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131802	Thank you. I'm asking the question, sir. Minister. When is the government's ambition that Denmark should be independent of natural gas supply from geopolitically unstable areas?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131818	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131820	It can be said that the fact that we have to be independent of natural gas, because it comes from geopolitically unstable areas, is of course an important point of reference, and it is clear that if you go back in time and look at when the green transition started in Denmark, then it did so before someone called it green, namely in the 1970s during the energy crisis. And I certainly regard this as an essential objective for us in the future too. However, I would like to say that what guides our policy in this area is that we must be free of fossil fuels. It has the side effect that we also free ourselves of these suppliers, which we might rather not be in our pockets. Because it can be said that the pace with which we intend to carry out the green transition in this country is indeed a very high rate, which fortunately means that we will also have a much greater degree of security for our energy supply, but of course also with some challenges which the questioner knows very well about and which we may be able to discuss a little more here in a moment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131930	Sir. Carsten Kissmeyer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126131931	Thank you for your answer. When we ask this question, it is of course because it is one of the reasons why we are currently looking into a very, very high priced natural gas which has also helped to push electricity prices. Specifically, I could ask the Minister: is this something that the Minister is travelling in an EU context? Because it's in this context that a challenge of this nature has to be dealt with. So it's in the minister's black book... I almost said... or whatever it is for a road map the minister has?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132009	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132010	Yes, I can assure you of that. Only last week, Friday and Saturday, I attended an informal Council of Ministers in France, where the French Presidency had put this on the agenda. It's a Danish priority. I would also like my good friends in the Left and Conservatives to try to influence their MEPs a little in that direction too, because unfortunately they are right now on a line where they will support showing both nuclear power but also natural gas becoming part of the EU's taxonomy, that is to say it has to count as green investment. I don't think that's helpful.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132045	Sir. Carsten Kissmeyer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132046	That is exactly what we in the Left are very much prepared to discuss, and the discussion about precisely what is green and what is not green is being updated by the current European debate. So we are content to have a dialogue on this. But has the Minister actually set the agenda, just as he asked: okay, what are we doing in this context?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132116	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132117	Yes, the Danish position has been quite clear from the start. It is very important that we do not make major structural changes that will damage the green transition in order to solve a short-term problem. This may seem a matter of course to us in Denmark, because I do not think anyone will support this kind of change, but it is certainly not elsewhere in Europe. Some people have used this agenda as an argument for us to build even more European infrastructure for gas imports, thus making us dependent on Russia, and I do not think that is the way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132151	Then it's the co-questioner, sir. Lars Christian Lilleholt. It's 1 minute. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132200	Thank you for that opportunity. It is also the European Union's track that I would like to go a little further on in relation to what considerations are being considered. I myself have been a little spokesman in the past for the fact that gas was better than coal, and I would like to know there: what kind of discussion is going on between your colleagues and you in the European Union about what kind of location is being given to natural gas in the future? It is a little in line with what Carsten Kissmeyer also mentioned.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132223	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132224	It is clear that, in isolation, gas is also better than coal. You can just look at emitted CO2 but that is not the same as supporting new large European infrastructure in relation to gas. There may be good reasons for developing gas infrastructure if, for example, it does so. is biogas, which we do on Lolland-Falster ourselves. But when we talk about very large investments in natural gas, we do not think that is the right way to go. I would also like that to be the case with the civil parties. In fact, I have some doubts about where the Left lies there, and it may be that the questioner can clarify it. However, as I have seen, I believe that the Left is, unfortunately, one of the parties which supports the fact that it should count as a green investment in the EU's taxonomy, and I would warn against that, if necessary.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132309	Lars Christian Lilleholt, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132310	This is something we need to look at. However, I would like to ask a question with regard to Nord Stream 2, which is one of the issues which has also been on the agenda of security policy recently. In the past, we managed to make agreements and restrictions in relation to the fact that we also had to distribute to other countries and that others should have the opportunity to get gas from the pipeline in question, and that it was sensible to get it into a European context as well. Are discussions continuing around Nord Stream 2 and the reason behind that project?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132338	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132339	I'm quite sure it does. It was not on the agenda of the weekend meeting to which I referred, nor was it the last time we had the Council of Ministers on this issue. There it was clearly about taxonomy. That is why I also welcome the fact that the Left will be discussing it internally, because I really do not think it seems, unfortunately, that your position in the European Parliament is quite a place where we would normally say that it would be in Denmark's interest.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132404	The last question to the main questioner, sir. Carsten Kissmeyer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132413	When we in the Left have chosen to put some questions to the Minister in this context, it is of course because we have a concern, both in the short and the long term, about energy prices. It is our view that energy prices play an important role in the welfare society that we have, and that is why we have chosen that the first two issues here have such a rather long perspective, and the subsequent issues have a slightly more short perspective in relation to the current situation. So our approach is to say thank you to the Minister for the answers, and we really do not have any more questions right now. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132457	Thank you. And the Minister has 1⁄2 minutes to answer that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132500	Thank you for that and for an excellent discussion. And we're not that far apart in it, so I thank you for the questions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132508	We say thank you to the two authors. We continue with a question to the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply, but now the questioner is Mrs Marie Bjerre, and the questioner is Mrs Louise Schack Elholm, both from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132530	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132533	Does the Minister believe that it is reasonable to allocate only 100 million? kr. in a heat package to counter high energy prices, when at the same time the state is expected to save large sums of money on the situation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132538	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132539	In other words, the 100 million. I think we should refer to the money we have set aside for the municipalities in order to help them bear the costs that will certainly be incurred in relation to the fact that pensioners and others who may not have so much money and are in a situation of pressure can receive support to cope with the situation when energy prices rise a great deal. So it is of course an aid to it potentially, but also really much larger amounts that are given out there so it cannot be seen in isolation. I have noted so well that the Left would like to raise that amount by 50 million. kr. This is a sympathetic proposal, and we are taking that into account, but I think I have to say that it will certainly not solve the major problem, namely that there are very many people in Denmark who are currently suffering from very high prices, and so it is not only pensioners and early retirement pensioners and others who can have a much-pressed economy; it can therefore also be other income groups in the country. That is what we are analysing now, and we will soon come up with a proposal from the government on what can actually be done about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132650	Marie Bjerre, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132650-2	Thank you for your answer. That is quite correctly understood. The 100 million. kr., to which I refer in the question, is the 100 million. kr. for a heat package. This is the only further thing the government is doing in this situation, where a great many Danes are experiencing increasing electricity and heating bills. And it hits very, very wrong. Some Danes get some heat bills that they can't pay at all. As perhaps the Minister's attention has not been ignored, we in the Left believe that it is a very serious situation that this is an exceptional situation. At any rate, I do not recall that at any time in my lifetime I have seen as much price increases as we are seeing right now. That is why we want to make it very clear here today that we want to make an extraordinary effort. And 100 million. kr. In a heat package, not many Danes benefit. It's a very, very small help. That is why my question is also: is it reasonable that this is the only further initiative to be taken? I am well aware of what the Minister is also referring to, that there are some existing arrangements already today to help this group of people. But they're 100 million. kr. the only further action that will be taken? And is it fair when we have received a reply to the effect that 2.7 billion will be saved at the same time? kr. in 2022 by paying less renewable aid because prices are as high as they are? Would it not be more reasonable to do more to bring some of that money back to the Danes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132817	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132818	I replied in the first place, but perhaps the questioner did not hear any more. So I can repeat that it is not the only thing. There will be more, and there will be soon. I note, however, that the Left only wants to increase that amount by 50 million. kr. I'd say all right, if the 100 million. kr. doesn't solve the problem, makes 50 million. kr. I guess not on top of that either. But it is not now to polemicise more about it, and I think the questioner himself is quite well aware of that. I guess I'm gonna have to arrest the President. ) Oh, no.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132853	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132853-2	If the Minister thinks that the Minister replied to the question in the first round, I also assume it is because the government can see that it is not reasonable to allocate only 100 million. kr. in a heat package. Then I would like to know whether the Minister can lift a little bit of the veil for what is then to be presented. On the left side, we have said that we would like to look at a reduction in the electricity tax. I have now noted that since the question was asked on Friday, an agreement has been reached, but only with a very small reduction in the electricity tax. Could you look at relaxing the electricity tax somewhat more, or do you have other initiatives?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132928	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126132928-2	I think I have to say that it is of course regrettable that the Left is not part of the agreement that lowers the electricity tax, but peace be with it now. It's in another negotiating room. This equation of saying that this year some support for renewable energy has been saved, and that money should then be used to compensate, for example. in relation to the electricity tax, I would like to know whether that is the new policy of the Left in this area. Is this the way we should do it, in relation to support for renewable energy, that in the years when there is a surplus in the goose-eyes, we can spend the money on something else?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133002	Thank you. Then it's the co-questioner, Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm. Here you go. It's 1 minute.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133007	I will then follow up on the previous question, because if the Minister thinks that all that needs to be done now is that it should be forever, is that a sign that the Minister does not think that we are in an extraordinary situation? Very many Danes experience some heat bills that are soaring. They're under pressure on the private economy. Does the Minister think that we should not do anything extraordinary now? When the Minister says that we need to change the whole system if we are going to do something now, is that a sign that it is because we will not do anything extraordinary in relation to the people who are in trouble here and now?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133041	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133042	No, and that's gonna be the fourth time I've said it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133045	Yes, but that is just how it could be understood, because when the Left proposes to spend some of the money that the state gets extra into saved costs by covering the lower costs here, we indicate how to finance the extraordinary support there is. But the Minister says that it should be changed in general. Does the Minister not think that an extraordinary measure can be taken and financed in this way? Is that an impossibility, according to the Minister?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133108	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133109	We come up with our own proposal. But I should like to hear: is the Left in the process of resigning from the energy settlements where these subsidies have been made? In other words, we cannot just start now to allocate funds, as it has already been decided how to be part of the economy, and where some years go up, some years go down. But is it a new policy for the Left that this is the way to look at the system of support for renewable energy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133133	Then we will have the final question from Mrs Marie Bjerre. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133136	We can understand from this questioning round that the Minister would like to do something, that it is not reasonable that 100 million should be set aside alone. kr. I would also like to point out that the government is making a proposal on what will then be done. That's how much I understand. But when we ask this question, it's because nothing has happened and it's right now that the Danes get these heating bills. This is a huge problem, and so far nothing has happened. That is why I would like to take this opportunity to ask here at the end: when is the government going to make such a presentation and what is it that you are going to look at? Is it a larger heat pool, or is it a greater relaxation of the electricity tax?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133217	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133218	Yes, this is going to be so fifth time I can say that we take it seriously we even take it very seriously. We were even a little ahead of the ball when we said in the autumn that this is going to be a very serious situation for the Danes. We have some pools that can already be used for people like pensioners, early retirement and others who have a squeezed economy, and we then add 100 million. kr. Upstairs. We are making an agreement with the district heating companies that they can allow district heating providers to stretch their bill over a longer period of time so that it will be a small increase. So we did a lot of things, but there's more coming.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133254	The question is closed. We continue with almost the same team setup, but now it is Mrs Louise Schack Elholm who is the main questioner and Mrs Bjerre, who is the co-questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133302	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133303	Does the Minister think that the 2.7 billion? kr., which the state saves on subsidies for renewable energy, should be returned to Danish consumers in the form of lower taxes or other measures that can reduce electricity and heat prices for Danish consumers?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133319	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133320	We are going to have to provide some kind of funding for the package we are bringing, of course, but exactly what it will be, I will present when I represent our proposal. But I simply have to say again that I do not understand what the Left wants. So, is it a new policy on the part of the Left that if there is money saved in the eyes of the goose, and you cannot even say that, for some years it goes up and other years it goes down, but that if there are years when the need for support goes down, the money to crowns should be reversed in tax breaks? Is it the new policy of the Left and, if so, will they step out of the conciliation that they are involved in?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133357	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133358	What the Minister is saying is simply nonsense. As I understood it, the Minister said that the money saved on support for RE measures was money that had already been spent in the Finance Act. But as I can see from the answer to the FIU alm. Part 23, it has been answered that of the marginal changes in renewable energy support compared to the 2022 Finance Act, where a lot of the money has apparently been spent, which has been saved, so you have been able to take the money out of the energy conciliation circle in that case there is just barely 2.7 billion. kr. not used. Will the Minister in the proposal made by the Minister suggest that all the money will be returned to Danish consumers, or will the Minister suggest that it is a small amount that will be returned to Danish consumers, or a larger amount?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133443	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133444	We are doing this in the way that previous governments, including former Left Governments, have always done so and respect the way in which these agreements are made in reconciliations, and we will do so in the future. I am in doubt, or rather said, I am not aware that this is just political teasing, but now I am teasing back and saying: well, can we then be told that this is the way in which the Left is going to conduct policy in the future, that is to say that the money that goes in the goose-eyes is being saved in the years when there are less support needs, should be returned to the consumers, and how will it be possible to cover the costs in those years when things are going the opposite way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133517	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133518	I think I'm going to ask the question again because I didn't get an answer to my question. Will the Minister suggest that the aid package that the government fortunately brings with it, but at an unknown time it is exciting whether it comes, while the Danes still have problems with the heating bill, will remain at the level that has been saved, i.e. the 2.7 billion. kr., under or above?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133539	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133540	When I don't answer it directly, it's because I've answered it six times before, and now I answer it the seventh time. We are going to come up with a proposal, but I will not stand here with all due respect in front of these two questioners today and present the government's proposals. We'll do that as soon as we're ready.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133556	Then it's the co-questioner, Mrs. Marie Bjerre. One minute. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133558	Thank you. I'm afraid we're running a little in circles. The Minister keeps saying that the Minister has answered the question and that the problem is taken seriously. But the thing is, you don't take the problem seriously. The government has only come up with a very, very small heat pool, one has only made a very small reduction in the electricity tax, in fact it is much smaller than one had proposed itself. In the autumn, when the government came up with its proposal... Denmark can do more I... it was proposed to relax the electricity tax in 2022 by 1.8 billion. kr., and with the agreement made last Friday, only 680 million will be relaxed. kr. in 2022. Nor have we been called for any negotiations on what can be done in this situation where the electricity and heating bill is increasing so much for the Danes. We have only had a few short discussions where there was a table round that gave us the opportunity to come up with solutions. But the government has not presented anything, and that is why we are asking these questions and taking the debate down here in Parliament, because we think it is a serious problem and we do not see the government taking it seriously enough.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133700	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133701	I do not know whether the questioner has not checked his calendar or his box, but the questioner has been called for a debate tomorrow morning.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133710	Here you go, Mrs. Marie Bjerre.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133711	We have had discussions and now we have finally been called to a negotiating meeting tomorrow, I am glad that the Minister now calls it a negotiating meeting, and then I look forward to presenting something concrete. The fact is that the government has not presented any solution to this problem, and I would hope, in a way, that the debate will be taken a little more publicly and that it will show the Danes that it is something that is actually taken seriously. So if the Minister can now unveil some of the proposals that will be made, then I think there will be a lot of people watching here who will be happy about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133745	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133746	I wonder if most people who may see or may have watched here have gradually turned off or turned down the sound, when I get the question for the eighth time now, it must be whether I am going to reveal what I am going to tell the questioner tomorrow morning for the negotiations. I don't think I will.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133804	Then it is for her final question the main questioner, Mrs Louise Schack Elholm. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133808	It is therefore clear that the Minister does not wish to answer the questions. We keep being told: there will be a good solution tomorrow! if I am going to quote a former chairman of the Social Democratic Party. That is more or less what we are told. We cannot be told because the Minister would like to hold it back so that the Minister can tell someone other than us. But after all, the Minister should try to answer the questions put in the Chamber. I actually think that's very good style. So the Minister must be able to say something about it. When will the Minister make a proposal? And how big will it be?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133842	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133843	After all, many new standards are being set by the Left this afternoon. Should I understand that if the Left gets power at some point, which, after all, is not, even if it looks a little bad right now, can be rejected 100 per cent and then an opposition party stands up and says: the Left owes it to present their proposals in this Chamber before they do so tomorrow or the week after or the week after a negotiating meeting, will they do so? It's just teasing. But more seriously in terms of substance, we are being asked to lower the electricity tax. In fact, we have done so with that agreement, and so we have done more than the Left, because the Left is not part of that agreement. Then it may well be that the Left says: Well we will lower it even more. But will you vote for what we are now lowering it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133919	The question is over. Thank you to the authors and thank you to the Minister. This means that we go further, but now it is with questions to the Minister for Transport, and that is by Mrs Susanne Zimmer, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133936	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133938	Thank you and thank the Minister for answering my question. It's quiet...
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133948	Mrs Susanne Zimmer can just read the question itself and then we will take the debate afterwards.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126133949	Thanks, and I'm sorry. In connection with the launch of the construction project Lynetteholmen on 17 January 2022, the Minister refused to allow a journalist from B.T. ask questions unless the journalist concerned would confirm the Minister's claim that the project is financially resting in itself. On this basis, would the Minister please explain whether it is the Government's view that journalists should accept and confirm the cabinet's presentation of cases before conducting interviews?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134020	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134021	Thank you very much for your question, first of all. In the few minutes we have to deal with this Article 20 question, we will hardly be able to reverse all the elements of the month-long history of B.T.'s misleading articles. And that's why I'm glad that Mr. Sikandar Siddique, when I invited him last week to a meeting where we could go through these things because Mr. Sikandar Siddique had spoken on the matter in the media, also suggested that Mrs Susanne Zimmer attend the meeting. I look forward to that very much so that we can get it all through. I shall try to reply to the few minutes that are here to the question of whether journalists should accept and confirm a statement. Of course they shouldn't. But I also agree that the clip shown shows a strange scene where B.T. has a question about an interview and where the conclusion is that I do not want to participate in an interview where the background is that B.T. will continue to mix the economy in the plant of Lynetteholm itself with any future urban development. B.T. The following articles have, inter alia, been published in the Official Journal of the European Union: The Ministry of Transport has unfortunately had to recover B.T.'s misleading premise from a rebuttal, which can also be read on the Ministry's website. I fully agree that it is a prerequisite for a well-functioning democracy that I should answer questions and be open about what we are doing. The press can also write and mean completely what it wants, and I am endeavouring to provide the media with answers in the form they would prefer. In this isolated case, I've just experienced that coverage in B.T. in this case is so misleading that I am simply not comfortable running for interviews, but instead answer all the media's questions in writing. Before I went over here, I have looked into it and I understand that there are no questions like B.T. have not been able to obtain a written reply in this case. So in other words, all B.T.'s questions have been answered. So it is about the form and not about the content in this context.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134228	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134229	Thank you. And thank you for your answer. In other words, when readers have to read the newspapers, it is the content they are interested in, and I understand that the Minister thinks that all questions should be answered, whether you agree or not. I am delighted, of course, because in a democratic society we need a free press that does not just have to ask questions if it agrees with the Minister as in this case. So that means that another time the Minister will answer such questions if the Minister finds himself in the same situation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134303	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134304	In this extraordinary situation, I didn't realize that B.T. would use the discussion of the premise for a possible interview to make an article about it. If I had known, it's clear that I would have rolled up the whole month-long history of B.T. Time and time again I regret to say that the articles have not been reproduced and that they have not been used, as I have said in a true and fair context. And that is why, as I said, in this very extraordinary situation, I choose not to run for interviews but to answer the media's questions in writing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134341	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134341-2	Now I ask, does it matter whether a journalist asks questions with a camera on it or whether the journalist asks without a camera on it? And then again I doubt whether the Minister will reply only if the interviewer or journalist has understood the premise put forward by the Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134403	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134404	It may be difficult to know whether journalist and media have understood a connection when writing articles continuously, which do not reproduce knowledge fairly, especially because other media, for example. Berlingske, who has written exactly the same articles with exactly the same sources, does not write any other critical articles misleadingly. Then it is clear that you can sit back with an insecurity that what you say is being used in a rightful context.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134437	Susanne Zimmer for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134438	Then I have to hear: when the Minister speaks of a fair understanding, does that really mean that the Minister says that there is one truth and that if the journalist thinks that one can understand the financial framework for • in this case, Lynetteholm • in a different way than the Minister, does it not justify asking questions and having an interview?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134500	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134501	There is a very comprehensive review of the information provided by B.T. has rewritten and is not true. They are located on the Ministry's website under the heading of Recovery. It would lead too far if I had to go through all this here, unfortunately, because there have been many misunderstandings. But I would like to make it clear once again that I will, of course, answer all B.T. I will continue to do so if there are any more questions. I just do not want to run in any form whatsoever, and I can explain that further when Mr. Sikandar Siddique and Mrs Susanne Zimmer are coming to a meeting.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134539	Thank you. The question is over. We move on to the next question, and that is to the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. It is Mette Thiesen of New Citizens who has asked the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134549	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134551	Thank you so much. Does the Minister think that politicians and authorities are better at deciding what the Danes consume of food than the Danes themselves?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134605	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134607	Well, the short answer is no. It is simply the Danes themselves who have to decide what they put in their mouths, what they want to eat, it is our own individual choice. No doubt about it. Having said that, it is no secret that there are many Danes who care about health, and also a lot of people who care about climate. And there we know that it is the case that we have been working with dietary advice for many years, in other words, where the leading experts in this area think about what is healthy to eat. When we could then hear that many Danes were also concerned about the climate, and that it actually turns out that what you have to eat to be healthy is the same as what you have to eat to think about the climate, we have chosen to beat several flies with a spanking and join them together to great enthusiasm for the many organisations. It is the case that the Cancer Society, the Diabetes Association, the Heart Association, the Arthritis Association and others say that diet advice is important, so the Danes get some good advice on how to eat healthier. And we also know that there are probably three out of five Danes who would like to eat more climate-friendly, and then it is also a good idea to inspire the Danes on how to put their meals together, so that you also reduce CO2 It is common sense. That's why we've put forward these dietary advices for free inspiration for the Danes. No one decides what to do, but you can choose to use them if you want to. And we can see that there are still more Danes who are inspired by it and who really want to use the dietary advice. There is, in fact, a greater interest in it now that we have introduced climate than where it was only health. I think that's amazing. I would just like to draw your attention to today's edition of the newspaper Denmark, where I am with a number of large organisations.I now mentioned patient organisations before, with there are also Denmark's Sports Association, DGI, the Consumer Council Think and others who say that dietary advice is a great idea, because the Danes must decide for themselves what to eat, but they may be inspired by good, sensible advice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134803	Mrs. Mette Thiesen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134805	It is good that I can hear that the Minister for Food knows what I am asking about here. I criticized the other day on Facebook that the minister and his board are spending tax dollars teaching the Danes about the consumption of broccoli. B.T. has subsequently revealed that in 2021 the Danish Food Authority, which now recommends a more plant-based diet, has spent a total of DKK 3,131,000. to inform about the new climate-friendly dietary advice. In addition, the board expects to spend DKK 800,000. on campaigns about dietary advice. So the government has bought broccoli for almost 4 million. kr. That's pretty crazy. The minister told B.T. that it is a super good and absolutely necessary campaign and that it is actually quite cheap. I probably got the coffee in my throat when I read it, to be honest. 3 million kr., almost 4 million. kr., that's quite a lot of money. Can the Minister document the effect of this information campaign, or is it really just the purpose of the election campaign on the taxpayer's account?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134915	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134916	Well, I'm actually really glad that this issue is being addressed, because I really think it's an exceptionally cheap campaign. So there is no question of spending 3 million. kr. 1 year. The 3 billion. kr. has been used over 2 years. And then there's 800,000 kroner being spent here for an extra year. So that's an average of 1.3 million. kr. So we're down to 25 cents a year, so we're down to 25 cents a year. Dane. We can just look at what the effect might be of this. The University of Copenhagen has carried out a study showing that there is a health effect, just the health effect for 12 billion. kr. a year. So that's 2,000 kroner. per Dane.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134955	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Mette Thiesen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126134956	Thank you so much. I therefore think it is quite crazy how the Minister vigorously defends spending the hard-earned tax dollars of Danes on educational campaigns that lack some proof of effect. It smells a bit like burning not only itself but also its resort area. So dear Minister: The government is not a teacher for the Danes. Politicians and authorities should not decide everything about the Danes, nor their intake of food. On Facebook, the Minister also wrote a little harshly and wrongly that I am against the prevention of serious diseases. Does the Minister believe that Danes who criticise lax handling of Danes' tax money are against preventing serious diseases?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135039	Thank you. Then we get an answer from the Minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135040	I simply do not think that this is a lax approach to the Danes' money. Making information, information and campaigns is something we have been doing for many years in Denmark with huge success. Think of the effort to inform the Danes not to drive drunk driving; it is something that has really worked. Look at the campaign from the 1980s and 1990s against smoking; it is something that has really worked. There is one example after another that information, information and inspiration have actually moved something. We can also see that with the dietary advice. The Danes begin to eat more climate-friendly and more healthy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135116	Then it is Mrs Mette Thiesen to the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135118	It's a little crazy sometimes what to hear before the ears fall off drunk driving compared to the consumption of broccoli. No, in my and New Citizens' optics politicians must decide less, and the Danes must decide much more for themselves. The official dietary councils were introduced back in the 1970s, and historically it has probably been quite reasonable to inform the Danes about the importance of eating healthy and varied. It has not really changed so much since then. And since then students have also been taught, for example, the food pyramid; I have done so myself in home education. But the Danes are a very enlightened people, which is why the broccoli campaign also seems completely meaningless and indifferent to me.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135156	Thank you. Then we get an answer from the Minister. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135158	I fully agree with Mrs Mette Thiesen that the Danes are a very enlightened people, also very curious. Therefore, it is also important that, when new knowledge is constantly being gained, we actually use some effort and modest amounts to provide information about this. Remember, if we actually eat after these diets, there's a potential of 12 billion. kr., which we can save on health expenses. That's 2,000 kroner. per Dane! The cost we spend on developing it and informing and informing about it here is 25 cents per cent. Dane.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135233	Thank you. This debate was going on. I would like to thank both the questioner and the Minister. Now we move on to a question to the Minister for Industry by Mrs Bjerre. The questioner is Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm. Both are from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135251	Here you go to Mrs. Marie Bjerre for the reading of the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135253	Thank you. Has the government considered whether it should also support the business community in order to counter the sharp rise in energy prices, and if so how?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135305	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135307	Thank you. I can say that we are following developments very closely in energy prices from the government, and currently it is the prices of gas and electricity that are significantly higher than the last firing season, and this is not something that just applies in Denmark, it is actually true throughout Europe. The good news is that there is a prospect that these prices will fall again, but on the other hand there is no doubt that the current high energy prices will of course affect both households and businesses. That is why, in November, we presented a heat package aimed at economically disadvantaged citizens, among others. with a pool of 100 million. kr., which should therefore be targeted at pensioners and cash benefits recipients. Right now, as the rapporteur knows, the Minister for Climate Affairs is discussing the situation with the parties of the Folketing, including whether further action is needed. I also understand that many companies are concerned and especially those who use very much energy in their production. But it can also be said that there is a reason why it is the families in particular that are the focus of this debate, because, contrary to the individual household, companies actually have the opportunity to pass on the bill. They can raise prices, and it is also the expectation that they will do so. We can, for example. already see that several of our grocery stores have announced that they are starting to raise the prices of various grocery products such as. cheese and butter, and that is an expected consequence of the fact that it takes a lot of energy to produce food. At the same time this is a common challenge, you can also say, in other words across countries, and it also means that the competitiveness of Danish companies is not really significantly affected by this. It is also an assessment I share with Danish Industry, so it is something that is like common understanding, i.e. that this is what reality looks like. Danish Industry generally estimates that companies are also not threatened with life. So it is consumers, in the end, that will be affected by this, and that is why it is also with the citizens that we believe is the right place to take action.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135513	Mrs. Marie Bjerre, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135515	Thank you for your answer. It is good to hear that the government is following this closely and that the Minister of Business is following it. In the Left, we have a very, very big focus on this problem, and we also see it from the citizens and consumers, and we have just run a round with the Minister of Climate, Energy and Supply, in relation to what you can do to the Danes. In the Left we have proposed higher heat pools and lower electricity charges. But we are not blind to what this is doing to the business community either, which is why I would really like to focus this issue solely on companies. The companies are also very hard hit, not only are we ordinary Danes hard hit, and this is also the case in North Jutland, where we are both elected, that is where the Minister and I are elected, and I think it is important that the government also knows that it hurts those companies, and I would therefore like to mention two specific examples from North Jutland, which I hope the Minister will take on board. For example, it is the merchant from Øster Brønderslev who has received an electricity bill of DKK 78.000. in January, and last year it amounted to DKK 34,000. It is also the company Danauk in Ulsted that has doubled their electricity bill, and this has meant that they have had to turn down the heat in their storage hall of 1,000m2 It can of course not continue to go for such companies that you have to do so. This means that we are going to lose jobs, which means that we are going to lose welfare, just as it cannot go for the rest of the country either. In fact, Dansk Industri says that companies' energy bills this year total 9.5 billion. kr. more expensive compared to 2019. I would therefore like to know if the government sees that there are any opportunities to help the business community in some way with these big bills that you are seeing right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135706	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135706-2	I share the assessment that what the rapporteur says cannot, of course, continue to go on and that is why I am looking very carefully at what the Danish Industry has said on this matter. They say that, in general, companies are not threatened with life, and they also expect this to return to normal. That is what we have the prospect of, namely that energy prices will normalise. And then there is the economic logic here that companies have the opportunity to pass it on by raising prices, and consumers do not, and that is why it is with consumers that I think is the right place to take action.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135742	Then it's Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm. No, I'm sorry, there was one more question from Mrs. Marie Bjerre. We're not gonna cheat each other, so go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135753	Thanks for what I thought I had one more round. I just need to understand the answer. So, does this mean that, as things stand at the moment, the government does not think that anything extraordinary should be done to help businesses, and does this mean that it is thought that it is enough to expect that prices will fall again, that they will normalise and that instead they will only help consumers?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135815	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135816	I mean, I'm saying a new heat package of 100 million has been made. kr., which was made last year. It targets the most economically disadvantaged citizens. Then right now, the Minister for Climate Affairs has negotiations and discussions with the Danish Parliament's parties to assess whether further action is needed. I am just trying to put the fact into the debate that companies have the opportunity to raise their prices and thus recover their additional costs. A Dane who consumes does not have it in the same way. That is why this is where I think we should take action. And that is also what we have announced with the heat package, and then, of course, we have to follow this situation closely, which we expect to normalise.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135853	Thank you. Now it is co-questioner Louise Schack Elholm who has 1 minute. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135856	It is of course very interesting to hear that discussion too, because the Minister, as I understand it, indicates that it is not assumed that this is causing the big problems for companies. I would like to know whether the Minister believes that this is a distortion of competition where people, for example, are concerned. walks away from the physical stores like SuperBrugsen or others and to the web-based stores, i.e. to the sort of thing like.com. For the physical shops must have a room that people can enter, and they must have coolers that have cooled down even if you open the door. The virtual shops don't have to do that. So does the Minister see that there can be a distortion of competition where people walk away from physical shops?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135934	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126135936	So, I think I should start by correcting what was said at the outset. I repeat my assessment of the case, which actually escapes with the Danish Industry's assessment of the case, which is • and now I actually quote Troels Ranis from Danish Industry: "In general, companies are not threatened with life. But it is clear that we are following developments closely and we are looking into how the market develops. But the expectation is that it will normalize itself. Then it is clear that there will be an overshoot. That's what companies will do... it always happens in such situations... and that's why it will land on the individual consumer, the individual Dane, and that's why we've played out with putting in there. Now we are discussing with the parties of the Folketing whether further action is needed, and there are different ways of entering the debate. The left then comes with some bids here on where you think there is a relationship that needs to be addressed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140025	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140027	I would like to ask the Minister whether the Minister considers that there is a distortion. I am quite well aware that Danish export companies are really capable of saving energy compared to their foreign competitors. So in this way it is actually a competitive advantage if one can put it that way; that is, it is also a little rough, but the foreign ones will experience it to a greater extent than they themselves will. The shops can put it on to the consumers, but the web shops do not experience the same price increase, or that is what I am asking the Minister, i.e. whether the Minister perceives that online shops, like.com and others, have the same price increases as those experienced in the physical shops.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140101	Thank you. Then it's the minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140103	Well, it's not an assessment I've had the opportunity to make up for this answer, but if there's a wish, you can of course always try to get deeper into the numbers. I believe that when energy prices generally rise, there will be different exposure compared to where you stand as a company. It is clear that energy-intensive companies will be hit harder, but in general the assessment is that from me as minister, and it is also from the Danish Industry that this does not threaten the companies' lives, and that it is a temporary thing that we come across again. Until then, it is wise to take action in relation to helping Danish consumers, and that is what we are proposing to do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140139	Then it is Mrs Marie Bjerre, on the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140141	Thank you. I would very much like to follow up on this, because the Minister replied very clearly that this is temporary and that it is not something that threatens companies and that the government will therefore instead focus on consumers. That is why I just want to know whether this is the correct conclusion I am making, namely that the government does not currently have any plans to do anything for Danish business.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140202	Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140203	Now I would just like to point out once again that the assessment I am making today is an assessment that I share with Danish Industry: that this does not in general threaten the lives of companies and that it is the expectation that it is a temporary phenomenon. Then I tell you that we have played out with a heat package that is targeted to consumers and that right now the climate minister is having discussions with the Danish Parliament's parties on whether further action is needed. And they are, but it is true that the heat package that has been launched is targeted at consumers, and I also think that this is where the problem must be greatest because companies have the opportunity to pass on prices to consumers, and it is the expectation that they will do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140237	The question is closed. Thank you to the Minister, thank you to Mrs Schack Elholm and thank you to Mrs Bjerre. Now we move on to a question to the Minister for Employment by Mr. Lars Christian Lilleholt, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140252	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140254	Thank you for that President-in-Office. What is the government's rationale behind the government having just set aside 100 million? kr. for a so-called heat pool for the municipalities' increased costs of personal allowances for pensioners and cash benefit recipients, for example?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140309	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140311	Thank you for the question. It's a cold time that we live in /all walking around and freezing. ▪ That's how Kim Larsen sang back in 1976. We know only the Danish winter too well with all its darkness and cold, and this very year the global prices of energy increase extraordinarily much. Fortunately, many of us can do that, but there are also people in our society who find it difficult to find money for the unforeseen costs that they have been given here without blame. The government will help them. It is basically about solidarity in an extraordinary situation. Therefore, the government, together with a majority of the Danish Parliament's parties, has set aside a pool of 100 million. kr. to support local authorities' assistance to special recipients of cash benefits and pensioners. The fact that we have just landed on that amount is due to several things. Firstly, the pool is a complement to the existing aid schemes that we have. Pensioners can, for example: have a heating supplement which is regulated according to their income and which may be increased in the case of significantly rising prices. Secondly, we have looked at the costs of those schemes in previous years, and we assume, based on our figures, that some municipalities in the country are affected more than others, for example. because they have many citizens with individual gas pine. The government is monitoring developments and is monitoring whether there is a need for more targeted initiatives to mitigate the consequences of rising energy prices. That is why last week the Minister of Climate, Energy and Supply also invited the conciliation parties to discuss energy prices. It is really a cold time we live in, but no one deserves to go around and freeze at home because of price increases out there in the big world. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140454	Lars Christian Lilleholt, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140456	Thank you for your answer, Minister. I very much agree that this is a cold time we are living in, and it is also a cold time for not least many pensioners and low-wage families to deal with the very, very large increase that has occurred. And it is not just an increase which has been this year, as the Minister said, but an increase which has been going on for a whole year now. Many families experience price increases in the order of several thousand kroner a month, and this also applies to pensioners. You distribute this 100 million. kr., it may be 200, 300 or 400 kr. per pensioners or married couples. Is that battery anything at all? When you get a price increase of perhaps a few thousand kroner, you get a handout of 300 or 400 kroner. I think there are many pensioners who think that that is all, far too little.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140540	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140543	Yeah, well, for now, it's better than nothing. As I also mentioned in my initial reply, I also know that the questioner's own party is involved in the current discussions with the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply on whether further action is needed. After all, we have both an expectation and a hope that these are some temporary fluctuations in energy prices, but of course there is no guarantee of this, which is why I am also pleased that, in the context of the agreement on Denmark, we can more on Friday's occasion have agreed on a significant reduction in the electricity tax in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140617	Thank you. Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140622	Thank you for your answer. It can be quite difficult to predict energy prices, and there are also many assessments in this context. After all, Danish Energy expects us to do this for a longer period, perhaps even the year out, and then it can be said that perhaps there are others other than pensioners who need a helping hand. Is the government and the Minister considering this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140644	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140645	We are constantly considering the situation we are in. So, I can only stress that I find it regrettable that Europe's dependence on Russia's gas in particular has helped to push prices up, and that is why, of course, we are following this whole situation very, very closely. This is also one of the reasons why discussions are currently being held with the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply about precisely this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140710	The last question, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140713	Thank you for that, President. After all, the Minister and the government are choosing such a subsidy model, a heat pool. Is there not the risk that this will be extremely bureaucratic and that the money will end up in the municipal funds instead of with pensioners?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140726	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140727	In other words, the pool provides direct and full compensation to the municipalities that are experiencing increased costs of personal allowances and aid for individual costs due to the rising energy prices. And that is what we think, at least at the time this pool was agreed, a good response to the rising costs of precisely those groups of citizens who may be particularly badly affected. But it is also true that we are following the situation very, very closely, which is why it is also gratifying that the questioner's own party is also in discussions with the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140801	Thank you, sir. Lars Christian Lilleholt. The question is over. We will continue with a question to the Minister for Employment, but now the questioner is Mrs Louise Schack Elholm, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140811	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140818	Thank you. The government has only set aside 100 million. kr. to a grant pool for transfer recipients is it evidence that the government believes that employees have no problems with the rising energy prices?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140826	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140828	Thank you for the question. The government, to which the questioner rightly refers, together with a broad majority in the Folketing, has set aside a pool of 100 million. kr. to support the help of the municipalities to those in our society who have the least and who are therefore hit hardest by the rising prices of electricity and heat. When we saw that the prices of heat and electricity began to rise, it was our absolute top priority to hold hands under the cash aid recipients and pensioners who have the very least on the coffin floor. It is basically about solidarity, and that is, as I see it, the core of the welfare society. That is not to say that no other citizen can get a scare when the next heating bill dumps into the letterbox. Therefore, we are also following developments closely in the government and are monitoring whether there is a need for more targeted initiatives to mitigate the consequences of rising energy prices, and therefore the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply also invited the parties of the Danish Parliament to discuss the rising energy prices last week. Because there should be no doubt that it is the government's view that no one deserves to freeze in their own homes because of price increases in the world, which they themselves have not mastered either pensioners, cash benefit recipients or employees. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140941	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140943	Should I understand that with regard to the scare that I understand employees have been given in relation to energy prices, is that something the government would like to look at and try to counter with some other initiatives?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140956	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126140958	In any case, it must be understood that this is something that we take very seriously and that we do not rule out taking any initiatives. In the first place, this is also why the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply has called for discussions on this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141013	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141014	Well, there has not yet been any government action on what to do to help the other groups. Our view is that of course this is really difficult for those who are on transfers, but it is also a problem for a great many employees who find it difficult to make everyday life stick together when they see that their heating bills multiply. Then there is a proposal from the government on what can be done for the other groups?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141037	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141038	I kind of share that. There are indeed very many employees' families who do not have very high incomes, who are also at risk of being hit hard by this, and that is one of the reasons why in the very good agreement that we made last Friday • Denmark can more • Denmark has chosen to lower electricity charges. It is also something that means that the result of that agreement is that the working families are some of the ones on the bottom line that will gain the most from that reform and, of course, be those who will experience the greatest reductions in the electricity tax.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141112	Thank you. The last question, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141113	We are also pleased that, after all, the government also chose to do, as the Left has also proposed, in other words to lower the electricity tax. Although it is not very much, it does help a little. Nevertheless, it may help to a limited extent the customers most affected by rising prices, namely those dependent on natural gas. For their taxes do not fall, but their heating bills multiply. So is the government going to do something about those who are actually experiencing the rising heat bills?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141139	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141140	That is absolutely correct, and it is also for precisely the reason that the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply has called for discussions on this very issue. And, of course, we hope that, contrary to Friday's agreement, a wide selection of Parliament's parties will help to discuss what good solutions are available.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141203	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the Minister and thank you to Mrs Schack Elholm. Then we move on to the Minister for the Environment, and the questioner is Mr. Hans Andersen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141218	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141220	Thank you. Does the Minister consider that the many growing concerns of citizens and municipalities concerned in and around the Tisvilde Hegn and Horserød Hegn are being taken into account democratically and satisfactorily in the ongoing process of designating the next ten national parks?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141242	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141243	Thank you for the question. That we now give a historical boost to Danish nature with among others. National parks were a promise that we made to the Danes before the elections, and we are now delivering on that, where we are naturally concerned about finding good local solutions everywhere. The involvement of the citizens of the next ten national parks started with the possibility of returning areas in June last year. The subsequent natural migrations are one of several processes of involvement, and I was also part of the Tisvilde Fence in connection with the natural migration there. There has been ongoing dialogue and input from researchers, municipalities, citizens and stakeholders, and here the contract circle has among others. set up a stakeholder working group with representatives of inter alia: The Free Air Council, the Danish Cycle Union, the Danish Sports Association and the Scouts to name just a few and they have all contributed with their perspectives to the selection of the National Parks, and we are also in dialogue with the municipalities. On the basis of the many inputs in the process, we decided to give more time to delve thoroughly into the material and also have a follow-up dialogue here in the new year, and we are also in full swing with that. And of course this also applies to Tisvilde Fences and Horserød Fences, and after the selection • very important • the dialogue and involvement will of course continue, among other things. with the creation of local project groups and the preparation of project plans and management plans tailored to each area and also in public consultation. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141419	Sir. Hans Andersen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141420	Thank you. The minister mentions that this must be an historic boost, that there must be good local solutions, and mentions that there have been natural migrations. But the Minister also mentions that the appointment of the ten specific national parks has been postponed, and that leads me to ask whether the Minister really thinks that process has been good enough, whether it has been inclusive enough. The other day there was a demonstration in Tisvildeleje involving perhaps 150 people, and I just wanted to say that my impression from that demonstration was that they do not share the Minister's view that that process has been involving enough. And that is what I would like to hear from the Minister today, i.e. whether the Minister really thinks that this has been involving enough, that we have actually listened to the many concerns that are out there in relation to nature parks, and here it is specifically Tisvilde Fence and Horserød Fence.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141538	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141540	Thank you. It is true that I mentioned that what we are doing is a historic boost of Danish nature, and this is so much needed. That is why I can be appalled at the fact that it is certainly not one of the issues on which the Left is focusing, either when we are debating in this Chamber today or when we have debated natural parks. Because there is therefore a need for us to do something for the Danish nature. Does this mean that we must ensure good involvement and good local solutions? Yes, of course, and that is exactly what we are doing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141609	Hans Andersen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141612	We fully agree that we need to have more nature and better biodiversity. But what may wonder is that when you look at the Tisvilde Fence, it is actually an area where biodiversity is very good. And I just have to say that when I talk to orientation runners, mountain bike riders, sleddog drivers and riders and users of Tisvilde Hegn in general, they don't see this as a good process. And that is what I am asking the Minister: is it really the Minister's view that this process is good enough?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141648	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141649	That is also quite fair to ask. I just do not think it is right for the rapporteur to say that we fully agree that nature must also have a helping hand, because we know what the professional recommendations are: large, coherent natural areas where nature is also allowed to be more wild. That's exactly what we're doing. There we can just see that the Left is questioning it: is there even a natural crisis? Are we even gonna do something about this? And that's too bad, because there are also meetings with the orientation runners and with the mountain bikers and with the riders, and I actually find that they are also concerned that we have to look after nature. These are precisely the common quantities that we are in the process of finding.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141723	Sir. Hans Andersen, last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141725	Thank you. My clear call to the Minister here today is to pause that process because the frustration is great. The experience is that areas now need to be fenced in. And with the conflict it can cause and the fear and frustration it brings to very many users, my call today is to the Minister: put the process on hold, and let us now sit down together and find the right solutions, because we also question whether there is only one solution now, and that is to decouple areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141801	Thank you. Then it's the minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141802	The questioner then contradicts a little himself if he first says that we are in complete agreement and that we have to do this and then says: no, we should not do this; we are in fact very doubtful about that. That's why you get a little doubt about the Left's course in this area. Will biodiversity really be better protected in Denmark? That's what this is all about. We have said all the way: Of course it must provide exciting natural experiences. We have made a tripartite agreement with the Free Air Council and the DN, and we meet with these open air organisations because it is important that you can also be active in the wild, and we would really like that. But it just doesn't change that the starting point for this is that we have to help the Danish nature.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141836	Thank you. The question is closed. But we will continue with questions to the Minister for the Environment, and it is still away from Mr. Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141842	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141844	Thank you for that: will the Minister ensure that a vvm study is carried out in connection with the establishment of the Gribskov Natural National Park and following on from the many critical consultation responses?
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141856	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126141857	Thank you for the question. The Danish Nature Agency has notified a screening of the project Naturnationalpark Gribskov, and in order to unfold it, I would say that the National Natural Park is assessed to be covered by the Environmental Assessment Act. It is therefore against this background that the Danish Nature Agency has notified this screening of the project in Gribskov and here has taken the view that the project does not need to undergo a full environmental assessment because the project is considered not to have a significant impact on the environment. The assessment is that the project will help to improve natural conditions. It is the Danish EPA which then is the competent authority that carries out the screening of the project. The screening carried out by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency is an assessment of whether the applied project can be expected to have significant effects on the environment, and prior to the screening decision, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency must then consult the interested parties, including the municipality. If, in its screening decision, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency arrives at the conclusion that the applied project is not expected to have a significant impact on the environment, the applied project shall not undergo an environmental assessment. The environmental screening of the project Naturnationalpark Gribskov is still under preparation and the Danish Environmental Protection Agency expects to announce the decision in April of this year.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142008	Sir. Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142009	Thank you. Since there are a lot of people who are affected by such a designation of Gribskov as a national park I saw the other day that there are horsemen, including horsemen with vehicles who fear that you can no longer walk in the future fence of Gribskov, and there are scouts who ask how they should move in this forest forward-looking • I think that it could be a very good model to conduct a proper, thorough vvm study of this project. Because it has a significant impact, not only on the environment, but also on the surrounding natural area, the surrounding municipalities and citizens who are affected by it here. Therefore, my request is that the Minister should now take the initiative to ensure that we actually carry out a proper and thorough vvm study of this, because that is what it is necessary to do, I believe, so that we have a thorough involvement of all the parties concerned, and I do not think it is reasonable to confine ourselves to screening.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142138	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142139	Now we are in charge of environmental impact assessment, and that is why it is the process that is being carried out here and that follows the process that is under way in Nature National Park Gribskov exactly common practice. After all, we have competent authorities in this country who can carry out such assessments, and in this case the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, so I am very surprised if the Left is not confident that the Danish Environmental Protection Agency can decide this on the basis of completely professional criteria.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142211	Sir. Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142212	I would just like to call on the Minister to listen now to the municipalities concerned, affected citizens and users of Gribskov in general and to carry out the thorough environmental impact analysis on the basis of a designation of Gribskov as a future national park. And I think that the Minister should give the benefit of the doubt to the interested parties here. So I don't understand the resistance to including the area and the project in a vvm study.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142248	Thank you. Then it's the minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142249	But this is not a political position, but a question of saying that we have some rules in Denmark that must be respected. Here we have some professional authorities which make some decisions, such as: in relation to vvm, and there the Danish Nature Agency has decided as a developer that it can be a screening. It must then be described, and it is the Danish Nature Agency as the authority that decides it. So should I understand that the Left does not believe that it is an authority decision? In relation to the involvement and the hearing, including on the management plan, there has been public consultation on this, and we are, as I said, fully involved.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142323	The last question to Mr. Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142326	I certainly think that the Minister should let the citizens and the municipalities concerned speak out more thoroughly than has been the case. The frustration is great, the insecurity is great, and therefore I do not understand why the Minister cannot allow the doubt to benefit the interested parties and listen to them and thus also listen in the way that a vvm study is being carried out, which is therefore more thorough than a screening. I do not understand why the Minister is so concerned to settle for a screening when the model could be an investigation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142400	Thank you. Then it's the minister. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142402	But that's turning it all upside down. As I said before, we would be delighted to be involved. I myself have been to Gribskov several times, both to meet with the municipality and with open-air organisations, for example. The orientation runners. Of course, we have to do all this. There is also a local project group that talks about how to make this work in everyday life, so that you can enjoy the exciting nature. But this is, of course, a decision of authority, and I know that the Left does not usually stand where there is no confidence in the Danish authorities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142429	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the Minister, and thank you, Mr President. Hans Andersen. That concludes Question Time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220126142436	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Thursday 27 January 2022, kl. 10:00. I refer to the agenda that will appear on the Danish Parliament's website.
