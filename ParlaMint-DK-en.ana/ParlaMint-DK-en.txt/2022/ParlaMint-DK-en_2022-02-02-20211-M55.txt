ParlaMint-DK_20220202130002	The meeting is open. Today there are the following reviews: Minister for Employment (Peter Hummelgaard): Bill no. L 115 (Proposal for a Law amending the Act on Active Employment, Act on Active Social Policy, Law on Unemployment Insurance, etc.) law prohibiting discrimination on the labour market, etc. Sikandar Siddique (FG) and others: Motion for a resolution (Doc. B 80 (Proposal for a Parliament resolution on the abolition of the land-use rule for the sale of housing) and motion for a resolution No. B 81 (Proposal for a Parliament resolution on a Climate Act 2.0 which ensures ambitious reductions in Denmark's total greenhouse gas emissions). Titles on notified cases will appear in www.folketingstidende.dk (cf. above).
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130030	The first question is to the tax minister, and that is Mr. René Christensen, Dansk Folkeparti, who is asking.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130040	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130041	Thank you and thank you for coming. Will the Minister speed up a reduction in the electricity tax, which will benefit ordinary Danes and business? That's the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130051	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130052	Thank you for that, President, and thank you for the question. As the questioner knows, the author's party and the government, together with the SF, the Radical Left and the Christian Democrats, reached a comprehensive agreement on 21 January on what we have called a new reform package for the Danish economy. It is an agreement that makes Denmark stronger, which strengthens the green transition and which also creates more jobs. This is a very good agreement for Denmark at all. The agreement also provides for a significant reduction in the general electricity tax. From July of this year, the general electricity tax will be reduced by 14 øre per year. kWh rising to 17 cents until 2030. This reduction in the electricity tax in the new agreement then comes on top of the reductions that have already been made, which the party of the questioner has also been involved in the energy agreement back from 2018. So, overall, this is a significant reduction, and in isolation, with the agreement we made last Friday, there is an agreement which, for the average family, means a saving of approx. 850 kr. annual. This is a very good agreement, which is entirely in line with the fact that we in Denmark have electricity generation which is increasingly based on renewable energy, and therefore what the government and the author's party have done together is the right thing to do. It benefits the green transition, it benefits families, and it is extremely important.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130226	The asker, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130227	Thank you. Thank you for your answer, and I would also like to acknowledge the cooperation that has been achieved, and we are also pleased with the agreement that exists. But there is now just one challenge, and it was actually the case that it was another minister I had called down here to answer the question about the electricity tax, namely the Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply, and it was because we are now negotiating whether to give a package of aid because of these high energy prices. It is actually the case that a lot of Danes now experience that it is really difficult to make the economy work together. For example, if you live in a house of 100 m2, two adults and two children, and if you have a gas guy, you have experienced an additional price of DKK 1,230. a month, and I guess that's after tax. On the other hand, if you have electric heating, i.e. with electric panels, you have received an additional cost of DKr 1,880. a month, I guess, after tax, too. So it really does run up, and it's almost 6,000 kr., it just can run up with electric heating in a few months. Then it is true that we have been part of an agreement where we also deal with some of these challenges, but what then lies a little bit in it is that the government in the negotiations that we are holding is putting up for the debate, and the tax minister is also part of the government • that you need a lot of effort to help the gas customers, but not so much effort to help the electricity customers. That is why our proposal was actually to look at whether we could bring forward some parts of the agreement that we have concluded and which we are pleased about, that is to say that this reduction in the tax was achieved in the past, that is to say to spend some economy on it, precisely in order to accommodate the families who have actually done what we have said across parties, namely to replace their gas boiler or replace their oil boiler and use electric heating. Because that is what we need, we need an electrified society, and now they get these very, very high bills, and the government wants us to go out and compensate those who use gas. Can the Minister not see that there is such a bit of a challenge in that and that perhaps there was an opportunity to move our agreement closer?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130416	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130417	Thank you for that, President. I am glad that the questioner also thinks that this is a good agreement we have made, because it really is, and it is an agreement that binds Denmark better together and which gives money between the hands of ordinary families. This is important for the Social Democracy and the Government, and it is important for the Danish People's Party, I also understand, and otherwise we would of course not have made the agreement either. But this is particularly important here, because after all it also helps to give a little more air to the economy, since we are already starting to reduce the ordinary electricity tax this year. So that's it. The questioner then asks about negotiations that are going on with a colleague and I think it is best that they are going on there and not here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130456	Sir. René Christensen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130457	The challenge is, of course, as the Minister also said, and we are, of course, on the goal of having what lies in the agreement on lowering taxes until 2030, so it is absolutely right that it is about DKK 800. a year, there is a saving on. It's really healthy for the individual Dane. The challenge is that some now have an additional cost of DKK 1,880. a month. Then you could say that the 800 kroner. A year may not be what makes it possible to stay, or not to go to Ribers, or not to get out on a slippery slope in relation to your economy. Therefore, although negotiations are elsewhere, can the Minister not see that there is a challenge?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130534	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130535	There certainly is. There is no doubt that the energy and climate crisis that is basically underneath this is a huge challenge, and that is why the government has also called for negotiations, and I know that discussions are going on with my good colleague, the climate minister, who usually sits here next to me in the Chamber. I also understand that they are in good shape. It is important, and there are families who, because of the extra bills that dump through the letterbox or come in the e-Boksen now, are challenged. That is one of the things we are discussing at the negotiating table of the Minister for Climate Change.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130611	René Christensen with his last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130612	Thank you. Of course, I fully understand that the Minister cannot answer that, and that is also why I am a little sorry that it is the tax minister who is here and that it is not the climate minister who is here. But the challenge is that what you have on the table is 800 kroner. a year, and what the Danes experience is that they get an expense of 1.880 DKK. a month. The two things are in stark contrast to each other. At the same time, the government has made a presentation saying that you will go in and support black gas, but not green electricity. I really hope that the negotiations that will take place with the other minister, the climate minister, will be positive in relation to the Danes. But we'll see what happens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130645	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130647	At any rate, I am very confident about the negotiations. After all, the government has said this very, very clearly: there is a challenge here that needs to be solved, and hopefully we can come together to resolve it together. It sounds like the government and the Danish People's Party are at least agreed on the challenge. Then it is clear that there is also a bill to be paid. We came together to resolve this in the context of the reform package. One thing, of course, is the reduction in the ordinary electricity tax, but when the questioner now has a hold of the tax minister, it should also be borne in mind that there is also an increase in the tax credit, which, as it is phased in, will also provide a further relief for ordinary families.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130723	The question is over. Thank you to the Minister for Taxation, and thank you to Mr. Simpson. René Christensen. We are moving forward, and now that is the question to the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. It's sir. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130736	Here you go for the reading of the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130738	Does the Minister think that broken breastbones on chickens are a necessary price that the individual hen must pay so that the Danes can continue to eat eggs?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130754	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130755	First of all, I am very pleased that this issue is being raised. This is something we have been working on in depth for a long time; it is something we take very seriously. To answer the question very briefly, of course, I do not think it is fair that these chickens should be subjected to it, that they break the sternum with any pain it may cause. I'd like to say that I was very upset and upset when I heard this story about that whole 85%. of our laying hens and it is well and bad, no matter what kind of chicken they are, whether they are organic or free-range, or in cages or any other kind of chicken suffers from this. This is deeply unacceptable. I have had meetings with the industry and with experts, and what I understand is that it is not possible to do so much at management level, in other words in relation to egg producers. It is with those who make breeding programmes for laying hens that the problem lies. I am familiar with two large companies - one in Germany and one in France - which are the ones responsible for breeding these laying hens. That is where the problem lies. That is why I have taken it up at EU level, where I was very pleased that there was broad support from all EU ministers for us to take this very seriously, to include it in our animal welfare policy in the European Union and to stop the breeding programmes that lie with the companies concerned, so that in future the laying hens do not get too small and lay too large eggs, so that you get this problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130932	Sir. Torsten Gejl, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202130933	The problem we are addressing with these questions is, of course, as the Minister also says, 85%. of Danish hens, caged hens, free-range hens, even organic hens, break the sternum when laying eggs. This means that over 80%. of the eggs we eat for breakfast are laid by a hen that has broken the sternum by laying, many of them several times. Everything suggests that it is associated with great pain for the chicken. The problem is that we have bred chickens that cannot stand to lay almost one egg a day. In the old days, chickens laid perhaps 20 eggs a year; now they lay more than 300 of them a year. I also told the Prime Minister in this Chamber, and she seemed really surprised and touched by it, just as the Minister for Food does, and just as everyone we're talking about does. The Prime Minister said that she would take it up with the Minister for Food when I presented the problem to her, so my question is therefore: Has the Prime Minister addressed the matter with the Minister for Food? And to what might the request have led?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131035	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131037	There is no doubt that animal welfare is very high on the government's agenda, which is why I have had talks with the Prime Minister about this. And, as I mentioned in my first speech, we have done so that we have written to all the EU ministers in this area that we have taken up at the Council meeting and received support for an EU investigation work, and then there is also the fact that we are writing it with laying hens' animal welfare as a focus of EU policy in this area. So it's going to work hard. There is also a piece of research and something else going on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131115	Thank you. Sir. Torsten Gejl, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131116	In other words, the problem we are addressing is something that is happening right now to millions of chickens out there who are experiencing great pain by breaking their sternum and, as I hear it, the breeding initiative that is under way may last for 10-15 years. Does it not take too long for us to wait for the European Union? Can't we do something to stop it here in Denmark? Well, I guess we'll have to be able to legislate so from this thing that we'll have it stopped sooner?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131149	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131150	Well, I totally agree that things can only go too slowly. Well, every day, there's a hen that has to suffer from this is a day too much. No doubt about it. However, regardless of what we have legislation in Denmark, it does not change the fact that they have laying hens in a way that makes us have the challenge, so if we are going to solve it, it takes place in the breeding programme. The positive thing is that it does not then take 8-10 years, as Mr. Torsten Gejl has mentioned, but that it may be possible to do so in a shorter period of time. So that's what we're working on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131223	Sir. Torsten Gejl for his last question, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131224	Well, in the alternative, we are in doubt whether the problem will be solved by the industry within the next 10-15 years. We can, on the basis of the initiatives taken to resolve it in the last few years, let chickens produce fewer eggs have not helped. Therefore, we also think that if the alternative puts forward a resolution in this Chamber which tightens up the animal welfare law in such a way that it is not legal for chickens to be subjected to bone fractures and pain in Denmark, would the Minister and the Social Democrats consider voting for such a proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131256	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131257	My best conviction is that the whole industry is deeply affected by this and is working dedicatedly to solving this problem. The fact is that over a number of years it has been changed in such a way that it is a few companies that you get those laying hens from. So we can't change it in a short time on Danish soil, but you do everything you can to change this as soon as possible, and we on the part of the government support that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131324	The question is over. Thank you, sir. Torsten Gejl. We will continue with questions to the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, but now it is Mr. Per Larsen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131335	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131336	Thank you. Will the Minister explain why a mink team ban continues to be maintained in 2022 when corona is no longer a social-critical disease?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131349	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131350	First of all, many thanks to Mr. Per Larsen for focusing on this issue, which there is no doubt a great interest in with the mink farmers concerned, so thank you for that. The political decision to extend the temporary prohibition of mink teams until the end of 2022 was taken on the basis of the Statens Serum Institut's risk assessment from 14 June 2021 and 28 September 2021. So these were the two times when we received advice from the Serum Institute and where we also had meetings with the rapporteurs on it. In September 2021, when the State Serum Institute confirmed their risk assessment from June 2021, covid-19 was also not categorised as a social-critical disease. So the situation was the same as today: It was not a social - critical disease. At that time, the State Serum Institute stressed the need for winter to gain more knowledge about vaccination coverage, about the duration of post-vaccination immunity and about the efficacy of vaccines against new viral variants, which is still the case. The situation is thus unchanged. We must therefore, on the other side of the winter, before the Statens Serum Institute can carry out a new risk assessment, and then we can then take the political discussion on continuing mink breeding in Denmark. I understand that the mink growers who have not decided to shut down are tripping for clarification, but we cannot open up overnight. As I have said before, we need the necessary professional assessments to be put on the table, and on that basis we must take a political decision. Fortunately, we are now in a very good place in Denmark in relation to the whole of the Covid-19 issue, and we must not put that at risk by making hasty decisions. That is where we need to listen to our authorities, including the Serum Institute.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131549	Sir. Per Larsen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131550	Thank you. Now we can always discuss whether the situation is very different. Well, we've just downgraded covid as a social-critical disease because we stand as good a place as we do. And the mink farmers are in a very difficult situation. They must at the moment decide whether to expropriate their farm or whether to continue with mink breeding. So does the Minister not also believe that it is essential that they be assured as soon as possible whether mink can be bred in Denmark in the future?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131622	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131623	These poor mink growers have been in a very difficult situation and they need answers as quickly as possible. But we have officials who we lean on in relation to when it is reasonable, and there we have been told that we need the winter to look into what the whole situation is like and on that basis we can take a position, and we are awaiting that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131648	Per Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131649	I have great respect for caution, but we just have to say that Denmark is one of the places where we are really, really strong because we have such a high level of vaccination in the population as we do. And we can see that there is mink breeding both in Sweden and in Finland and in Poland and elsewhere, which is why it is surprising that we are not actually already going in and asking for a description from the health authorities of a setup where, for example, we are going in. do as in Sweden and Finland, where the minks are vaccinated.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131724	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131726	What we've been told from the State Serum Institute is that you need the winter months to look into what this whole situation is like. So there's kind of a month left before we can get a review. I don't know how fast you can be ready with it. But on the basis of that, we need to look into what is possible to start up again. That is what we have talked about with the rapporteurs; that is what we have talked about with the State's Serum Institute. What is just important is that we do not put public health at risk, and that is what we are focusing on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131800	Per Larsen, last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131801	Thank you. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Minister believes it is important that we get mink growing back in Denmark from an economic point of view. We know that it is many billions that will be used for expropriation. If, for example, is 10%. Of the mink farmers who want to continue, perhaps as much as 2 billion can be saved. kr. So does the Minister think that it would be appropriate for us to re-establish mink farming in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131832	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131834	After all, we have been in an extraordinary, special situation in relation to mink breeding, where there was this possibility of infection and also of the storage of infection in these minks, which is why the decision was taken back in November 2020. This has meant that we have made a broad agreement in the Folketing to make a full and complete compensation for these mink growers, so that they can be kept harmless. What we can see is that the vast majority have chosen that scheme. Now we must ensure that there is clarification for those who are left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131909	Thank you. The question is closed. Thank you, sir. Per Larsen, and thank you to the Minister. Then we move on to the next question, and it is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration by Mrs Kathrine Oldag, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131933	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131935	What is the Minister's view that young people born and raised in Denmark are refused a permanent residence permit solely because they choose to change the direction of education?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131952	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202131953	The short answer is, I'm tired of it. A permanent residence permit is, of course, a commitment to a more permanent and more permanent stay in this country, and it is therefore both sensible and reasonable that we should normally make strict demands that we have contributed to society and integrated before we can obtain permanent residence permits; I am in favour of that. That means, as the clear starting point, among other things. a requirement for employment. But we also have a rule that we have to take a little account of young foreigners, who are obviously at an age where you are not so much in employment but where you are more educated, and that is why we have a special rule that young people under the age of 19 can obtain a permanent residence permit if the young person has been in full-time employment or in education since primary school and meets the other conditions for permanent residence, that is to say, with the exception of the employment requirement. So we do not demand that the young person has been in employment for 31⁄2 years in the last four years. On the other hand, we demand that the young person have had a full-time job or been in education since primary school. At the same time, the young person must meet, among other things: the duration of the stay, the Danish examination requirements and self-reliance requirements, and also have not committed certain types of crime. I have been quoted several times as saying that we must have a strict but not a crazy foreign policy, and I still think so. I therefore also recognise that there may be a need to make these rules for the 18-19-year-olds more flexible so that they will have the desired effect and so that we do not see these examples of successful young people getting into trouble. Against this background, I have now asked my officials to examine the rules and how they work in practice. The objective is that we should have some rules for permanent stay for those 18-19-year-olds who are tight, but not crazy. This means, among other things, that I want to stick to the demand that we have not committed serious crime, but that I can see that there is a need to adjust the rules on how we understand education and full-time employment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132153	Mrs. Kathrine On Saturday, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132154	It is fantastic news that the Minister now actually intends to look at these rules and adjust them. It will be exciting to go into that work and see what it really means. We will, of course, get into dialogue about this. The reason why I am asking this question at all is that we have a very topical case with Tajma Mehic from Horsens, who is caught up in these rules, since she has changed youth education in the middle of a school year and thus not been what you might generally call student activity for 3 months, although she has been enrolled in two courses at once. So we have a group of young people who have a different ancestry and yet have fallen into Denmark, and my question is really: what is the general consideration behind not recognizing Tajma, who is subject to these rules, and others like her, who were born and raised in Denmark, as Danish? And now that we are still looking at the rules for permanent residence permits, could we not also have the employment requirement changed, so it also included training?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132256	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132257	With regard to the general rules on permanent residence, we think it is sensible that we should have an employment requirement. We have also said in the past that when you assess whether people have been in employment, all employment has to count, and that also means that if you, for example, have been in employment. We also think that this should be counted as employment under the employment requirement. Conversely, we don't think it should count if you've been on su. We are going to put forward proposals for this by the government, and we are going to look at these rules as well.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132330	Kathrine illdag, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132334	Will the Minister, with the amendments to be made now, guarantee that, in future, for young people who, like Tajma, change their course of study, it will not go beyond their ability to obtain permanent residence permits that they should not fear it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132347	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132349	Well, the rules that generally apply today, such as... I want to maintain the fact that no serious crime has been committed, and I also want to maintain the rules that relate to the fact that you have not received cash aid for long periods and that you do not owe public money. Then we also have a rule that you should have been in full-time employment or education since primary school, and I think it's to say that you shouldn't be at home on the couch. But we must probably also recognise today that many young people are changing between youth education. I've done that myself. I dropped out of high school after 4 months, and then it also took a little time before I started technical school. That is perfectly normal, and we should not make that a problem, even for young people who do not have Danish passports.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132424	Kathrine Ollldag for last question, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132425	This isn't the first time we've heard about this kind of thing. My inbox is filled with requests from citizens who get caught up in crazy alien laws. So I have a proposal: in relation to young people born and raised in Denmark, we could start by reintroducing the access to citizenship that we introduced together with the Social Democracy in 2014. It is not fair that young people who are as Danish as you and I should feel alienated in their own country. Would the Minister like to take a look at this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132451	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132452	So, the immigration authorities make almost 100,000 decisions a year. That's insanely many. And we cannot expect all the people involved in these matters to be happy, because some are granted a residence permit and some are refused. So I am very sceptical about the fact that you say that every time you see a single case, we have to get in and change the legislation. This is among other things. some of what has stressed foreign law and created sloppy over the years. But, of course, we have to listen with open eyes, general curiosity and interest to those people who have been affected by alien law and then consider with ourselves whether it is an expression of being tight or crazy. And if that's the last thing, we have to clean up after ourselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132527	The question is over. Thank you to the questioner. We will continue with questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration, but now it is Mr. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132542	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132543	Thank you to the President and thank you to the Minister. I can't see the time. President. - The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: The question is: With reference to the Minister's statement that I do not think we should accept that a person will not shake hands with a person of the opposite sex in the article "Tesfaye on handshake case": It is a Danish value that one can greet each other regardless of sex • brought in Jyllands-Posten on 19 January 2022, does the Minister believe that it is up to the State to decide who should greet who with physical touch?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132629	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132631	The short answer is no. The government doesn't think the state should decide how we greet each other. However, I am pleased that the questioner has put on a T-shirt today, which gives us an opportunity to discuss equality. And we believe that the handshake is also a question of equality. It can be between rich and poor; it can be between young and old; it can be between woman and man. I am glad that we greet each other in the same way across differences in Denmark. I think this is beautiful and an expression of the fact that we have come a long way with equality in Denmark. I am provoked when you hear of greetings in other countries that are different, depending on whether you greet a rich or a poor, a casteless or one of the upper classes. That is why I am provoked when you hear about people in this country who do not want to greet each other, for example. in the opposite sex, in the same way as you greet someone of your own sex. So for me it is a question of equality, and the article in Jyllands-Posten, to which the questioner refers, came in continuation of a discussion in my own municipality, Albertslund, where there were two teacher students who would not shake hands with their internship counsellors. It provokes me.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132746	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132748	But there are many ways of greeting each other, and I know there is no custom or culture or religion at least not the religion in question here, i.e. Islam that forbids you to greet the opposite sex. It's just another way to greet each other that women don't physically greet men and that men don't physically greet women. You say hello to each other. So the premise for the conclusion made by the Minister is wrong and false, because we are greeting each other; that is just another way of doing it. In this context, I would like to ask: who is it that the Minister thinks is being oppressed? Who is being oppressed? Who is the victim of unequal treatment? In this case, women do not physically greet men, and men do not physically greet women, so who is it that is oppressed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132856	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132857	You can relative these discussions, but I actually think they're quite important. After all, we belong on the same side of the Assembly, and we should like to be those who are in favour of information, equality, democracy and dignity. We need to be careful about relativizing this. Everywhere in the world where there is no gender equality, it is women who lose. We greet each other in the same way in Denmark. It is an expression of equality. Every time someone breaks it, equality takes a step backwards. The vast majority of the world's Muslims have no problem shaking hands with each other. After all, it is a radicalised extreme that has chosen a different solution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132935	Sir. Sikandar Siddique, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202132936	We need to be careful about relativeising, but we also need to be careful about demonising. The case in question, on which the Minister gave his opinion, was that a court board considered that it was discrimination when the two women were fired for not wanting to greet the opposite sex with handshakes. They were told that 25,000 kroner had been allocated to them. Does the Minister acknowledge that according to the Minister's particular Danish value, it is contrary to current legislation, cf. the decision of the court in the case in question?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133012	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133014	I would like to stress that no court has taken a position on anything. There is an equal treatment board that has taken a decision, and they themselves must stand up for it. But I note that my own municipality, Albertslund Municipality, has asked for this matter to be dealt with in the courts and I will follow it very closely, because I think it is an important matter. I would just like to insist that there is a value struggle going on in European societies, but also in many Middle Eastern societies, where democracy and freedom of expression and equality are being pushed back by secularism and some fundamentalists are taking a step forward. And here we have to decide which side we want to stand on. The people who don't want to shake hands are on the wrong side.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133048	Sikandar Siddique for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133049	I would say that it is still a bit crazy to hear the country's Minister for Integration call two teacher students fundamentalists and extremists and everything that is now being said about that I still think that is crazy. The Equal Opportunities Board, which is a board we have set up in our society to combat discrimination and ensure that people are not discriminated against, says that what the Minister is in favour of is discrimination. Will the Minister acknowledge that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133123	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133125	I don't want to call the two teacher students fundamentalists I've never met them, and I don't know them. But showing up at a workplace and not wanting to shake hands with an internship counsellor because he belongs to the other sex, I think is a fundamentalist act, and these are values that do not belong to Danish society. They must be combated and repressed; we must not support them and defend them and wrap them up in all manner of chatter. It is a problem that those values are advancing in Danish society, and I am pleased with that school's attitude, and I am glad that the municipality has appealed to the courts. I really hope that we will end up in a situation where we all recognise each other in Danish society regardless of gender.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133159	That's the end of the question. But we continue with both the minister and the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133206	Here you go, sir. Sikandar Siddique for reading the next question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133206-2	Thank you, President. Thank you, Minister. The question is: On 30 June 2020, Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said about the Assad regime in Syria that we are entering the 10th year of the conflict in Syria. But the crimes of the Syrian regime continue. Bombs, toxic gas attacks, chemical attacks, torture... The regime is known for torture and arbitrary detentions, as well as people who disappear into the regime's prisons. Numerous reports describe the worst forms of torture, does the Minister of Foreign Affairs consider that it is a satisfactory and credible assessment that it is safe to send war refugees back to Syria as long as the country has been ravaged by the Assad regime, which the Minister's own government has condemned for war crimes described in detail by the Government's Foreign Minister?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133301	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133302	I would like to start by saying that I agree with every word of what the Foreign Minister has said. In 2015, a broad majority of the Folketing agreed that asylum permits granted on the basis of the general circumstances should be withdrawn or refused if there has been an improvement in the general conditions of the home Member State. That was seven years ago. This is true regardless of the fact that the situation remains serious, fragile and unpredictable as long as the improvements are not of a temporary nature. It is on the basis of that law that the authorities make their decision, and it is of course the assessment that the legislation is within the framework of Denmark's international obligations. There have also been no cases against Denmark in this regard. In other words, it means that those from Syria who have been told to go home have been informed because the authorities have considered that they no longer have a need for protection and are therefore no longer refugees. People who continue to have a need to protect them are, after all, most people because they risk persecution or abuse are, of course, allowed to stay in Denmark. They will be granted an extension of their residence permit. The same applies if Denmark's other international obligations say that the person should be allowed to stay in the country. It is, especially if there is a concern for the unity of the family, which is protected by what is called Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having said that, I cannot, nor will I, interfere in the judgements or decisions of the authorities. It is a principle, the so-called arm's length principle, which not only this government, but also earlier and hopefully subsequent governments will comply with. I have faith in the authorities' professional judgements. I trust that they will make decisions in accordance with both Danish and international law. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133448	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133450	Well, the rules for repatriation are politically determined, so this is a political question. This is not about the arm's length principle. But let me try to correct the question. So, the statements by the Foreign Minister came two days after the government issued a press release stating that it was now going to review these cases of Syrian refugees' protection needs, and at the same time the Foreign Affairs Agency began to deprive Syrian refugees of their residence permit and said that it was safe to go home. So that was two days later. On the one hand, the government allows refugees to return to Syria, while on the other hand, the government believes that the Assad regime exposes its own people to torture and war crimes. Okay, on the one hand, we want to send them home, that is safe enough, and on the other hand, the government says that the Assad regime exposes people to torture and war crimes. Does the Minister think that it is acceptable for the government to allow the repatriation of refugees to a regime which the government itself accuses of torture, war crimes and to make people disappear? That is the specific point I would like the Minister to make.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133559	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133600	But I think I have to make it clear that whether people need protection is an individual assessment of their specific needs. You may need protection even if you come from Germany or Sweden. There are no dictatorships there. But it may be that you have a specific need for protection attached to your person. On the other hand, you can apply for asylum and come from a terrible dictatorship somewhere in Africa without having any individual protection needs. We are not helping people because there is an evil government. We help people because they are at risk of persecution or torture. And these are individual assessments.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133635	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133636	But, Minister, I just have to say that the Minister has now been in an EU hearing where Social Democratic colleagues asked the Minister: How can you sleep at night? We are talking about our neighbouring Germany, where in December 2021 a federal court considered that Denmark is no longer a safe third country for refugees. Earlier this year, the Minister received harsh criticism from EU colleagues. After all, the government is left alone with that attitude. That is why I would just like to repeat the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133711	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133712	I should like to start by saying that the Danish Government has not been in the European Parliament for questioning. We have attended a meeting of the Committee of the European Parliament which is working on some of these issues. And it is true that there is one from such a slightly extreme party, I would judge it to say: How can you sleep at night? I myself have been thinking a little bit about this issue, because I really do not think that we in Europe should sleep calmly at night with the current asylum system. Many of us woke up and were appalled when we saw a picture of a six-year-old boy washed up on a European coast. I think we were both appalled by that. But 22,000 people have died in the Mediterranean last year. We should:
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133750	Thank you! Then that is the last question from Mr. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133752	Now I had prepared another question, but the answer really gives us reason to ask more, but okay. Finally, I would like to ask the Minister: will the government support a proposal for a refugee policy that complies with the UN Refugee Convention, which gives refugees the right not to be sent back to war or persecution, or insists on sending refugees back to poison attacks, chemical attacks and torture in the government's own words? Now the Minister will have the opportunity, with this open question, to remedy the failed policy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133832	Then the Minister will have the opportunity to reply. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133833	The question is: will the government support a rule that complies with the UN Convention on Refugees and ensure that people are not sent home for persecution or torture? To that is the answer: yes. But there is no reason to introduce that rule, because it has already been part of Danish legislation for years. Denmark was the first country to sign the Refugee Convention. We're the last country to leave it. In the annual assessment of legal standards worldwide, Denmark has been no more than 6 consecutive years. One in what's called Rule of Law Index. There is no reason to fear that the Danish legal system, including the Refugee Board, does not meet the international obligations of which we are part.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133910	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you, sir. Sikandar Siddique, thank you to the Minister. Mr Sikandar Siddique, thank you to the President, thank you to the Minister. Now we move on, and now that is the question to the Minister for Employment, and it is from Mrs Anni Matthiesen, the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133919	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133921	Thank you for that, President. What is the Minister's view that, in the light of the government's new reform agreement in the future, it will pay better to be on the daily allowance rather than in the work of 126,000 Danes according to a study by the DA?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133939	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202133941	Thank you for the question. The daily allowance system is a cornerstone of the Danish flexicurity model, which contributes with security to employees and flexibility to employers. I am therefore very pleased that, with a new reform package for the Danish economy, we have agreed to invest in the unemployment benefit system, so that we ensure the future of the Danish model. The investment takes place among other things. for an employment allowance at the beginning of the benefit period, so that it will be possible to get up to 23,000 DKK. during the first three months of the benefit period. The employment allowance applies to people who have been in work and loyally supported the community in the benefit system for a number of years. And that applies, as it is today, which is important to remember that the maximum level of compensation in the benefit system remains at a maximum of 90 per cent. of one's previous salary. The fact that the supplement lapses after 3 months also ensures that there is still an incentive to look for work. This also applies during the first three months of the benefit period. I believe that we have found a good balance between security and the incentive to find work. In conclusion, it is my and the government's clear view that no Danes dream of being on daily allowances. They want to work. However, if unemployment should nevertheless occur, I am very pleased that we are increasing income security in the benefit system in a balanced way. At the same time, I am pleased that the employment allowance is part of a comprehensive and balanced agreement which, overall, increases structural employment by approx. Twelve thousand full-time people and increase our gross domestic product by 17.5 billion. kr. in 2030. All we need now is for the Left to pull on the work clothes, put away the hatchet and back up the agreement so that we can get the many good moves to work quickly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134124	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134125	I can then start by saying that in the Left we are always in work clothes. In fact, I think you are obliged to be a member of parliament as well. When I get around my local area, one of the things I hear most as chairman of the Danish Parliament's Enterprise Committee is that industry is simply screaming for labour. That is why I think there are some shortcomings in some way adjusting it now. And it may well be that the Minister says that it is a guarantee of the future of the benefit system, but does the Minister not agree with me that it can actually have the meaning that fewer people will get to work?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134209	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134210	Basically, I do not believe that. And in reality, I would also like to be honest and say that this measure is one of the measures. We have also been taken in view of the fact that the Corona crisis has revealed to all of us that, regardless of what social relationship we have, we can become unemployed. And there we can see that there has been a need to say: how do we go in and ensure that, if you go without your own fault and become unemployed, whether it is due to a virus from the distant world or a financial crisis or the like, then in the first few months of unemployment you can feel safe? That's what this proposal does. Furthermore, if the Left is in the working clothes, we would very much like to help ensure that the initiatives contained in the reform agreement can be put into effect.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134252	Thank you. It sometimes helps to speed up, but the speaking time is still exceeded. Mrs. Anni Matthiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134256	Thank you. In other words, when, in fact, we have been calling for a long time in various sectors of the economy for labour shortages, we in the Left believe that more is needed. And I would like to acknowledge that the agreement, which the government among other things... has entered into with its support parties, helps to close a gap. But does the Minister think that is enough?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134325	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134327	Well, that actually does more than just help close a hole. I am pleased with what Mrs Anni Matthiesen says and will encourage her to go back and talk to her parliamentary group as well. For what is currently holding these initiatives, among other things. The change in the rates of graduating, which I know is also a Left wish, from going out and working, is, of course, that the conciliation circle in the field of unemployment benefits does not say: yes, for God's sake, we agree, finally get it put into effect, get it legislated on, so that these hands can come out and be available.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134358	Mrs Anni Matthiesen, last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134400	Yes, that is enough there, one can say where we disagree with the way the money is spent in relation to the graduation rate. Because we would have liked them to go for more green conversion rather than an increase in the daily allowance rate. Finally, I would like to ask: what further plans does the Minister for Employment have in order to obtain even more hands now?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134425	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134426	First of all, I would like to say that there is nothing to hold the Left or the bourgeois parties if a majority were to be obtained after the next parliamentary elections, from converting, in relation to what it is, the proceeds are to be used for a change in the graduation rates. We have found it important to have an overall balance in the benefit system. This contributes both to the release of money, but it also helps to ensure that there is a strong collective unemployment insurance system. In addition, we will, of course, legislate on the initiatives we have. We also want the government to open up the possibility of recruiting foreign labour in a controlled and limited way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134505	Thank you. The question is over. But we will continue with both the Minister and Mrs Anni Matthiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134510	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134510-2	Thank you. Does the Minister agree that it is deeply problematic that our Danish experience and tourism industry cannot provide the necessary hands to serve customers, while at the same time the government makes it more favourable for 126,000 Danes to choose the daily allowance rather than, for example, cleaning one of our many depressed hotels?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134532	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134533	Thank you again for the question. We are currently in a situation where employment is record high, unemployment is low and we have an industry crying out for labour. If companies cannot get the hands they need, then it is obvious that we are all losing. As a society, we cannot afford that, and we have done more to meet demand. On the one hand, we have reached a tripartite agreement on labour shortages in the autumn, and on the other hand, here we have a reform package of initiatives on foreign labour, more graduates in work, less set-off for pensioners and pensioners' spouses working, and an employment allowance to make it more attractive to take an extra job. It is a reform package with many elements that the bourgeois parties have asked for in the past and yet in the conciliation circles where they have something to say will not allow actually to be implemented. With the reform agreement, we are increasing structural employment by some 12 000 full-time people. One of the proposals in the agreement is an employment supplement, which is also what the questioner is talking about here, in terms of whether it is still worthwhile to work. And yes, it can. It remains the case that a maximum daily allowance rate of 90 per cent can be obtained. of the previous salary. The employment allowance does not change that. The fact that the supplement lapses after 3 months also ensures that there is still an incentive to look for work. This also applies during the first three months of the benefit period. With the agreement, we have found the right balance between security for the individual employee and, at the same time, an incentive to look for a job. It is an investment in the Danish model and the flexibility that benefits the whole of society, including the companies. Let me just remind you that there is no one dreaming of being on cash benefits. With the reform agreement, we will provide an answer to increase the structural supply of labour. I think the Left should back that up. I would therefore appeal for the Left to drop the political markings and instead support the fact that we can make the many good initiatives work as quickly as possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134735	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134737	I also believe that the Minister for Employment, with the many years of experience that the Minister has in this Parliament, is aware that there are some things that we in the Left have a great deal of difficulty with, and that is one of them. to increase the daily allowance rate and thereby ensure that it is not worthwhile to work for a great many people. I therefore hope that the Minister will also come around the country and meet some of the business owners who are now really in big, big trouble. As a tourism rapporteur, I can say that this is one of the things I meet almost daily, that is that both hotels and the whole experience industry simply lack a great many hands. I can say that if you read the Jutland West Coast and have done so in the last week's time, there have been almost daily examples of companies that could employ both 10, 20 and 30 employees as early as tomorrow if they were there. I think it is a pity that we are not doing any more to ensure that, for example, we do not. foreign labour can also come here. It is in many of the professions where there is a great need for more foreigners to come here to work. I can tell you that Lalandia in Billund lacks 120 employees. I can say that nurseries in Sønder Omme could employ 10-15 employees if they were there. That is actually why I am appealing a little to the Minister to look at how we can help these companies, because in the end, if they do not have any employees, it will affect all of us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134911	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134912	I am very happy to accept that appeal, but I can also correct it in the opposite direction. Why is it that Lalandia in Billund or the nursery schools, to which Mrs Anni Matthiesen refers, have to wait until after the next parliamentary elections for some of the initiatives that Mrs Anni Matthiesen's own party otherwise agrees to be able to work? Why is it that the reorganization of the graduation rate, which can help to free up more hands that can be available for some of the work that is being demanded, should wait until after the next parliamentary elections, simply because it is not ambitious enough?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134950	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202134951	Because it only covers the gap created by the government itself, and that is not enough. It takes more than that. Could the Minister not in some way consider whether more could be done for these companies? Because is it not correct and perhaps the Minister could confirm this in the answer to the next question that if we do not help these companies, we are actually stalling developments?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135017	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135018	I think that is quite correct, and that is also why I find myself completely incomprehensible that the Left in the conciliation groups will not just allow the initiatives which, by the way, they themselves agree to be able to work immediately and as quickly as possible, rather than delay it after the next parliamentary elections. I could understand it if it was because one was then forced to vote in favour of something one disagreed with or that one had to agree to something one disagreed with, but that is not the case. The initiatives covered solely by conciliation are all part of both the pension sector and the graduation benefit sector, which is part of the Left's own policy, and therefore Anni Matthiesen owes an explanation to Lalandia in Billund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135057	Thank you. Then that is the final question to Mrs Anni Matthiesen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135100	I can then tell the Minister here in the end that I am also talking to them. But what I also hear is that the way the government wants to spend the money is not the right way. In other words, the fact that you want to increase the rate of unemployment does not help to get more people into employment, and that is also why I am appealing to the Minister to perhaps try to rethink the situation and to think about whether we could do this in a more clever way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135128	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135129	When it is that we want to increase the security of people who become unemployed, it is quite fundamental because some of what makes Danish companies competitive compared to all sorts of other companies across Europe is that we have a labour market that is very dynamic, where it is easy to fire, and it is easy to hire, and where, moreover, there is a very, very large job turnover. The large job turnover in the labour market in Denmark is only made possible by the fact that people feel safe in the event that they become unemployed, and that security has by far been eroded. And that is why we want to ensure that we have proper security in the first few months when we have become unemployed, if we also have a firm link with the labour market.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135208	The question is over. Thank you, Mrs Matthiesen, and thank you to the Minister. Today's last question is to the Minister for the Environment, and the questioner is Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135222	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135224	Thank you. What does the Minister think about the great opposition among many Danes and in several of the country's municipal councils to the way in which a majority in the Folketing has unfortunately decided to set up natural national parks with starving animals behind high fences?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135239	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135241	Thank you. I would really like to talk about the national parks, but before I go into more detail about how we would like to give Danish nature a historic boost with among others. I would just like to start by correcting a few misunderstandings about what the questioner is beginning with. Firstly, the questioner has got animal welfare a little wrong in his throat. Of course, the animals we put behind the fences must be well served today, it is true in the future national parks so that nature and animal welfare go hand in hand and not the opposite, and that is, no matter how many false claims flourish out there in the debate. Secondly, each area that will be designated as a national park is different, and that is not true when the questioner speaks only of high fences. We all know the low two-thread fences from countless places in Agricultural Denmark, and grazing is only one of the tools that is needed to help nature along the way. We will, for example: also restore wet areas on the forest floor and make room for untouched forest, and all of this is in a dialogue with citizens, with municipalities and with associations to find good local solutions, both before the appointment, but also, of course, with the local project groups that will be created after the appointment. Our nature is in crisis, and I hope the questioner will agree with me, and that is why not enough has been done for many years, and we are changing that now. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135412	Mrs. Mette Thiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135413	Thank you. In Hillerød, where I live and until recently sat in the municipal council, I actually managed to obtain a majority for a critical consultation answer about the fences in Gribskov, and there was a clear majority to say no to the fences in Gribskov, as did Gribskov Municipality. In New Citizens we are strong champions of our natural values, because the Danish landscape is beautiful and we must take care of it because it is part of our cultural heritage. But the law on national parks makes it possible to keep domestic animals behind high fences, and the purpose could be, for example, to leave cattle or moose wild in the area. They may not be fed, but they must live on what is, and when there is no more food, they will then die of starvation. Does the Minister really believe that domestic animals behind high fences will be wild if they are not fed or cared for?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135511	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135512	I think that's exactly why it's so good to have this lifted down here in Parliament. For now I have mentioned some of the misunderstandings in the original question, and here again it is repeated that there are animals that are going to die of starvation and nothing could be more wrong. So that is not true when reference is made to the legislation in force and it is possible that animals may die of starvation. Animals must not starve, and there must be shelter, shelter and food all year round. It's our responsibility. Then the questioner says New Citizens are preoccupied with nature. But do you agree that nature is in crisis and that we need to do this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135548	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Mette Thiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135549	We certainly agree that it is a good idea with national parks; we just do not agree that it is a good idea with high fences. Because domestic animals don't just get crazy by being put behind fences and being allowed to take care of themselves. For example, there is a difference between grassers and browsers, and therefore it will also be individually which animals fit into the different areas, i.e. whether there is enough to live on at all. However, the law, which I mention, makes it possible to derogate from Article 3 and Article 9 of the Animal Welfare Act; in other words, it makes it possible to derogate from requirements to ensure the welfare of the enclosed animals. Is this not the way to accept state cruelty to animals?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135629	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135631	No. And that is also why I would like to repeat it today I did so very many times in the debate. I also think it is important for the New Citizens' rapporteur to take it back, because what I am hearing is that we should help nature, we should have natural parks, and we should have these grazing animals, which we know is a good tool for caring for our nature. They must not starve; that is not what the legislation says, and that is not possible. It is, of course, one of the things running out there, also on social media and other things, but it would be contrary to what has been agreed in this Chamber if that is what you are going around saying.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135705	Mrs Mette Thiesen for her last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135706	I just have to get the Minister to confirm that this is what I think is called L 229, where it is possible to derogate from Section 3 and Section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act, so that is what it says. But the enclosure will not be just for the animals; it will be just as much a fence that keeps many nature lovers out as animals inside. It could be the local forest children's garden that can no longer use the area because you may be worried about whether some young bulls show up, or the access conditions for elderly, poorly walking or people with disabilities become difficult so that they cannot get there. Doesn't the Minister think it's a bad idea to fence in nature so that the Danes are shut out and the animals are locked in?
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135742	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135744	In other words, in relation to what lies in L 229, it is wrong to keep saying that animals must starve. It's wrong. And so I would very much like to invite Mette Thiesen over to review what is really in this paragraph rather than want to. But it is wrong, then, when you keep saying out there in the debate that animals must starve. They can't do that. They are our responsibility... that must be sheltered, sheltered, fed all year round, and that doesn't change the law. And then, of course, we have to make sure that everyone gets out and experiences this amazing nature. Whether there are low or high fences, we would really like to invite the Danes out for exciting natural experiences.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135820	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the questioner, thank you to the Minister. That concludes Question Time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220202135827	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Thursday 3 February, at 3 pm. 10:00. I refer to the agenda that will appear on the Danish Parliament's website.
