ParlaMint-DK_20220428100121	Amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard does.
ParlaMint-DK_20220428100149	I take the floor, also because, as the contribution from our report says, we were actually a little surprised that things were mixed up, because we think we are doing that here. We are very committed to helping where we can in relation to the Ukrainians. We have gone so far that we are also voting in favour of a special law. But we were very puzzled when we realised and in the debate afterwards it seemed as if the Minister for Integration was a little surprised that Afghans also come under this scheme. After all, it is located in two ministries, i.e. also in the Ministry of Employment, so perhaps there has not been proper coordination between ministries. That is why we are asking for the proposal to be split up so that we can vote individually and so that we can give our support to Ukraine, but not to the Afghan interpreters.
ParlaMint-DK_20220428100245	After legal advice, I have to say to Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard that, since no amendment has been tabled on it, it cannot be done. It's the highest legal expertise that says this. I am told that there must have been an amendment to the Rules of Procedure. Can I make an addition?). Yes, of course, when you are not allowed to have a vote, you are allowed to add something.
ParlaMint-DK_20220428100302	Thank you. Well, I would just like to ask you to read the comments very carefully, so that you can at least fully understand what this is all about. In fact, I do not think that Parliament was at first reading. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220428100322	Then I'll see if anyone else wants to speak. As this is not the case, the debate is closed and we shall proceed to the vote.
ParlaMint-DK_20220428100328	PRESIDENT. - The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: 1-4, member of the Committee? They are adopted. Amendment No 1 shall be put to the vote. 8 outside the report by Peter Skaarup (DF), and a vote can be taken. The vote will end. In favour of voting 11 (DF, NB, Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG), Karina Adsbøl (UFG) and Lise Bech (UFG)), against voting 87 (S, V, SF, RV, EL, KF, LA, FG, SP and Nas Khader (UFG)), abstention 0. It has been rejected. I shall now look at Amendment No 17. 9, also tabled by Peter Skaarup (DF), who rejected. It has been rejected. PRESIDENT. - The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: 5-7, elected by the Committee? They are adopted. I propose that the draft law should go directly to the third reading without referral back to committee and, if no one objects, I consider it adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220428100426	For technical reasons, a short break must be made. I'm here to close the meeting. The next meeting will be held today at 2 p.m. 10:15.
