ParlaMint-DK_20220224214501	The meeting is open. I am happy to announce that the Defence Committee has finished their work. When we cannot vote now but have to postpone the vote until 8 a.m. 22.00, it has something to do with the technique; it has to be put into the system. So unless the system goes crazy, we're gonna vote at 8:00. 10:00. There are no delays in that way, because, as I said, the Defence Committee has finished their work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220224220000	The sitting is resumed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220224220009	The item listed as No. 1 on the agenda, can only be dealt with in this sitting with the agreement of the House. Are there any comments? It's a matter of course.
ParlaMint-DK_20220224220020	No amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? As this is not the case, we shall proceed to the vote.
ParlaMint-DK_20220224220040	The final adoption of the proposal shall be put to the vote and a vote may be taken. The vote will end. In favour of 90 (S, V, SF, RV, KF, DF, NB, LA, ALT and KD), against 9 (EL and FG), abstentions 0. The draft parliamentary resolution has been adopted and will be sent to the Foreign Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220224220102	There is no more to be done in this meeting of Parliament's next meeting tomorrow, Friday 25 February, at 2 pm. 10:00. I refer to the agenda on the Danish Parliament's website.
