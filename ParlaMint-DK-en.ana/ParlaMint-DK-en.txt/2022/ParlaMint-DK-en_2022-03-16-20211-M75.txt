ParlaMint-DK_20220316130201	The item listed as No. 1 on the agenda, can only be dealt with in this sitting with the agreement of the House. The vote shall be taken on consent and, in accordance with Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure, a three-quarters majority shall be required for such consent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130217	A vote can be taken. The vote will end. In favour 103 (S, V, SF, RV, EL, KF, DF, NB, LA, FG, KD and Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG), Karina Adsbøl (UFG), Lars Løkke Rasmussen (UFG) and Lise Bech (UFG)) voted against 0, abstentions 0. The consent is granted, and that means that we can now proceed with the examination of Bill No. L 145.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130240	Amendments have been tabled. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130304	Thank you. First of all, I would just like to thank the Danish Parliament's parties for a rather fine treatment so far. I think it is urgent to deal with legislation, but it is also important that we act decisively in this very violent situation. The Socialist People's Party supports the special law, but we also have some concerns about what is currently 4 people in order to be more precise and I would like to mention them here. Firstly, we fear in the SF that local resources are not available for a proper reception of refugees. Children's reception is absolutely crucial to their having a good existence in Denmark. This is particularly important if they are going to be here for many years. In the SF we have proposed a special family allowance for the municipalities to help with the reception of refugees. We are also tabling an amendment on this, and I hope that more people in this House will consider whether they will not agree to it in committee. The government hasn't clapped its hands like this for the time being, but it's pepper nuts that this costs. In the overall picture, this is not a particular expense. On the other hand, it will make a really big difference out there. That is why I hope that there will be more people who will support it; perhaps some bourgeois parties could also reconsider their position. You should not even vote in favour of some kind of funding that you do not like. Secondly, it would also be wise for the government to use this opportunity to consider whether it is really sensible policy to channel so much of the money that goes from development aid into refugee reception in Denmark. These are, therefore, some of the most poor people in the world from whom these funds go. We had the debate yesterday. It is not new, but I think that in this situation it would make good sense to think very carefully before drastically reducing the funds allocated to development aid in the world. That is why we are also tabling an amendment by the SF, the Radical Left and the Enhedslisten to change it here. Thirdly, it would be sensible to guarantee the duration of the proceedings. Unfortunately, we have seen, both in general terms in the asylum system and with other special laws, how we can promise each other in here at Christiansborg that refugees must be slushed quickly into society, only then to see the processing times running out. The law should, in my opinion, contain a ceiling on the duration of proceedings which the Folketing guarantees, also financially, so that, if the system does not comply with the times, we have an opportunity to use some additional resources and have that consumption covered by us. Fourthly and finally, I hear several municipal tremors that are nervous about what health coverage the Ukrainians will have during the processing period, from the time they have applied for residence until they have received it. Many Ukrainians are now privately accommodated or accommodated, and we must expect them to apply for a residence permit from their current address. Several of them therefore need healthcare, they are fleeing a war, but in the bill I do not see that there should be a legal basis for municipalities to bear the costs of healthcare for Ukrainians before they have received a residence permit. That is why I have also asked the Minister to indicate how the municipalities and Ukrainians have been placed during the period from their arrival here until they are applied for, and whether it is appropriate that the Ukrainians should not be able to stay in the same place during the application process and receive the necessary health care there instead of being pressured to be accommodated at a reception centre or the like. It is very nice that you can be with friends or family, or where you have now gone when you came to Denmark, and that you should not necessarily go to a reception centre in order to receive the treatment you need. These were the concerns I wanted to raise and I look forward to the further examination of the committee. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130704	Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Christian Juhl. Christian Juhl No, I would like to speak as a privateist). I'll give it to you, sir. Christian Juhl saw. Then we thank the rapporteur and move on to Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130725	Thank you. I would like to say briefly that we support the draft law. There has been a thorough examination of it and it is a very, very good legislative proposal. Then there is the part about funding, where we have tabled an amendment together with the Enhedslisten and the SF. This is where Parliament and the various parties must decide whether we should send the bill to welcome the Ukrainians to the world's poorest. There is a political majority in favour of doing so. I would just like to say that the government and the Social Democrats have drawn a picture that this is a practice that is uncontroversial because it has occurred before. I just have to say that it is so far from being uncontroversial to send the bill to the world's poorest and that it should be uncontroversial for a party which itself believes to be concerned with international solidarity, I find it extremely difficult to understand. To this end, it is possible to calculate expenditure as development aid: it can then also be discussed whether it is development-oriented to use it for asylum expenditure. That does not mean that we should not add to development aid. So there's a political choice in the Social Democratic Party. It's gonna turn out, because you still have the opportunity to change your mind that this bill should be sent to the people in the world who have the very least. I just want to ask you one more time if you in the Social Democratic Party are absolutely sure that's what you want. At least it was not when we last had this debate, namely in connection with the flow of refugees in 2015. So what has actually changed since the bill to welcome refugees now has to be paid by those who have the least in the world? Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130922	Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130926	Outsiders might get the impression that this is the first time that this so-called DAC mechanism has been used to record costs in this way. I would just like to know whether the rapporteur can confirm that this has been done in Denmark since 1992 under successive governments and that, therefore, this is not what one might get the impression of when one reads some of the statements, namely that this is a practice that has been invented over the last week's time. This has been a practice since 1992. Can the rapporteur confirm this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130956	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316130956-2	No, you could not get that impression, because I made it quite clear that it may well be that that practice has been there before, but it does not do so either uncontroversial or right. Again, it is a question of whether we want to count it as development aid, and I think that is certainly a relevant debate, but if you do, then the question is why we should not find more money for development aid. That is the crux of the matter. Why is it that we are not prepared to find alternative funding? Why should the poorest in the world pay for us in Denmark to welcome the Ukrainians? Because, of course, we have to do it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131034	Sir. Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131035	I see this as confirmation that changing governments have been doing this since 1992. I assume that the rapporteur supports this, although it was not quite clear in the answer. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131051	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131051-2	The rapporteur cannot see this as confirmation that I support the fact that it has been done. I certainly recognise that this has been done before. We were against this at the time. Moreover, the Social Democrats themselves have been opposed to this. There's Social Democracy somewhere else now. So if something has changed, it is the Social Democrats' attitude towards who should pay the bill. It is now the world's poorest.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131117	Then it is Mrs Karen Ellemann, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131118	I would like to ask the radical rapporteur what would have happened if we did not adopt this special law for Ukrainian refugees. Where, then, would the bill, that is, the cost of making various initiatives here in Denmark for Ukrainian refugees, have fallen?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131140	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131141	Well, that would depend entirely on what political choice had been made. As I have said a few times now, it is true that it can be counted as development aid. This does not mean that we would not have been able to agree to find any other means of adding to development aid. So it is entirely dependent on what a political majority in the Folketing has wanted to do in that situation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131205	Mrs. Karen Ellemann.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131206	But the truth is that if we did not adopt this special law, it would be in the asylum system alone. The second question I would like to ask the rapporteur is this: if the legislation we are discussing here is two points below, it is exactly 2 billion. kr. from the development aid account being drawn? So the rapporteur can say whether it will be exactly 2 billion. kr.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131229	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131231	To the end, I would like to say: no, I very much hope it does not. We in the Radical Left will certainly do everything in our power to ensure that this does not happen, so we hope that we will not have a lot of expenditure that will be unnecessary. After all, we all want and hope that the Ukrainians will get out very quickly and become self-supporting. In addition, we will continue to fight for more funds for development aid so that it does not become the poorest in the world.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131257	Sir. Jens Rohde, KD.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131258	In principle, I agree that this is a strange way of doing things. In 2015 it meant that Denmark was the country in the world that received most development aid funds from Denmark when we had the large flows of refugees. So I think it is sensible to go in and then discuss it at a strategic level. However, if we change a practice that has worked since 1992, there must also be a lot of money for it, because there are many conflicts along the way. If you have that indignation and the outrage about what is happening now, then you have to do something about it, and that is why the natural question is: what will the Radical Left come to the Finance Act for the coming year? What will the Radical Left stand on and where will they say: we insist that it should be financed and that there should be so many more billions in development aid?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131401	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131402	Thank you for the question and also thank you for the rapporteur's support for the principle view. We will stand on what has been a radical policy for many years, namely that we must work towards spending 1%. • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • development aid • This is a radical policy, and we have gone to the financial law negotiations year after year. We will also now work on the short-term issue of finding the means to increase the framework for development aid, among other things. in the reserve provided for in the national compromise on defence and security expenditure, where funds can also be allocated to humanitarian interventions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131440	Sir. Jens Roh.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131441	So we can count on the Radical Left next time to come to the financial law negotiations with a full-on demand that we hit the 1% and that it is totally financed in the Radical Left's financial bill. Is that how I'm supposed to understand it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131454	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131456	The rapporteur will know that the Radical Left's financial bill is always fully funded, and we will also, as we have done in the other years, make proposals on how we work towards spending 1%.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131508	Sikandar Siddique, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131509	Thank you for the floor, President, and thank you to the rapporteur. The Radical Left has said throughout this debate and throughout the week that the law here discriminates and that we should not take money from the poorest in the world. And when I ask why it is that the agreement is included, then the main argument, at least according to yesterday's debate, is that we take responsibility. But, frankly, it does not seem to me to take responsibility for agreeing to a financing agreement and then to problematize that funding. So just to get some clarity here: has the Radical Left agreed to an agreement that it is the poorest people who have to finance this, but now they regret it? Or has an agreement been reached without finding out where the funding should come from, and then you find out afterwards that the government is saying that it should now be taken from the world's poorest? What's up and down here? If the rapporteur could just explain that. Because, frankly, it doesn't seem responsible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131604	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131605	Well, I'd both like to explain and really like to find out what's up and down. Because we have not nodded to funding where it is development aid that has to finance this. We have agreed, of course, to help the Ukrainian refugees to receive as much as possible, and then we have not actually been fully informed at that time about the distribution the government wants in funding. That is why we are also tabling an amendment. So we think it is highly questionable that the government has not done so, and by the way, we are going to pursue it. But no, we have not said yes to financing where the bill was to be paid out of development aid. Now we are in a situation where we are tabling an amendment. Let's hope there are some people in here who change their minds. But otherwise we will have a choice, whether we are going to let all this very good legislation fall on it, and there we choose to say, so to speak, that we will not; we choose to stand on the right side and take responsibility for welcoming Ukrainian refugees. However, this certainly does not mean that our fight for this not to be taken out of development aid and for us to find more funds for development aid is over.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131709	Sikandar Siddique, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131711	I think it seems strange to many people that they think it is discrimination and that they think it is the wrong people who have to pay, and then you go anyway. But do I hear the rapporteur say here that an agreement has now been reached without having talked about and without being sure where the funding is found, in other words that it has gone a little too fast?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131734	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131735	I can at least confirm that we are not satisfied with the way in which the government has submitted the information to us. We have acted, absolutely, in the best faith, of these funds would not be taken out of development aid. We have been informed that some of it would be counted as development aid. But that is certainly not the same as saving 2 billion. kr. for the current year. We've never said yes to that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131802	Then it's as I see it, sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131804	Thank you. Again, I would say that rarely have I seen so many parties speak so much against a law and yet vote in favour of it. Now Radicals, SF and Enhedslisten appeal to other parties not to let the world's poorest pay for a highly discriminatory law. If it turns out that the world's poorest people are going to pay this highly discriminatory law, will Radicals consider withdrawing support to the law?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131830	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131833	No, we could not dream of voting against a law that is absolutely necessary for us to be able to welcome the Ukrainian refugees in Denmark. We could not do so, and I think that has been explained very carefully yesterday why we will not do so. However, our fight, as I have also answered the others, for us to find more funding for development aid, is not the end of today's vote in favour of the legislative proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131857	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131859	I would like to say that we had the debate at first reading yesterday in the Chamber and before it was such that, among other things, we had the debate at first reading. Radicals said that they would support the law, it was quite obvious that a great deal of money had to be taken from development aid. That is what we are nodding when it is the case that we support a law in which it has been said as a very clear premise. So I don't even understand what this is all about. How much will Radicals accept being taken by development aid to vote for this law?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131929	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131930	We have not, as we are debating the law, not the first-reader, but are negotiating the agreement that lies behind the bill, agreed that 2 billion should be taken. kr. from development aid, and we are going to fight to change that distribution. That is why we are tabling an amendment, and that is why we are continuing to fight for more funds for development aid.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131952	Then it's mr. Morten Messerschmid, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316131956	Thank you, President. Now I am not going to try to spawn oil on the waters of these beautiful dog battles in the red block, but I may have a solution to the radical rapporteur's problem. What makes it impossible for us in the Danish People's Party to vote in favour of this law, but votes yellow, is that it is not only about helping Ukrainians, but also that section 2 provides the authority and access to Afghans, Syrians, etc. who are in Ukraine and could actually just go to Poland, Hungary or one of the neighbouring countries, can now come to Denmark. It is clear that this will lead to an increase in the funds which the rapporteur seems to be afraid of coming from development aid, and that is why I would just like to call on the Radical Left to vote in favour of Amendment No. 7, so that we get them out of the law and that move gets smaller.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132046	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132047	Well, thank you for the suggestion. But no, we could never dream of voting in favour of the discriminatory amendment, because of course we will help anyone fleeing Putin's bombs.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132059	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132059-2	But is the Radical Left rapporteur not aware that the people we are talking about here, i.e. people from typically Muslim, Middle Eastern countries, are already legally entitled to be in Poland, Hungary and all other EU countries that do not have a legal reservation? Why is it partout that they are going to Denmark? So, one thing is that we should help Ukrainians, we all agree on that, but why should Denmark also spend considerable funds to help these Arabs in Denmark, when there are people, can I understand the rapporteur, who lacks the money in Africa or elsewhere? Couldn't we do more good there than help them this way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132135	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132136	For exactly the same reason that we are going to help the Ukrainians, and that is because it is people who are Arabs or not.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132147	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments, which means that we are now moving on to Mrs Rosa Lund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132200	Thank you. We in the Enhedslisten have tabled a number of amendments to this special law. The first amendment we took a long time to discuss yesterday, which concerns the target group, i.e. who is to be covered by this special law. There, in the Enhedslisten, we believe that we should get as close to the EU directive as possible, and that is why we believe that those covered by this law should be extended. We have tabled amendments to that effect. But what we have also tabled amendments on together with the SF and the Radical Left is funding. Because it simply cannot be that in this emergency that we are in now, it is the world's poorest who have to pay for the world's refugees. That is why we have tabled an amendment. And I very much hope that each of you, when you have to vote, will think about whether you really want to sit on you, that the people who are also the victims of this war, namely the people who are in a huge food crisis right now in Africa because of this war, have to pay. What we are proposing quite specifically is that we take 1.2 billion. kr. from the national compromise that you then take 600 million more. kr. from the corona war box, and then you put down the last 400 million. kr. Into the DAC system, just as we have agreed with the government, the SF and the Radical Left in the Finance Act and the Alternative also for that matter, I'm sorry, sir. Torsten Gejl. We are proposing amendments to that effect. We think this is a much more fair financing of this special law. And I have to say that I simply cannot understand that the government will not be involved in making this funding, firstly, and secondly, at least to allow the parties that are behind this agreement to share in sharing out the savings that have to be made. For it is clear that, in the situation we are in now, there is some foreign aid that we simply cannot cut off. That is why I and Enhedslisten believe that it will be the only right thing to do. That is why we want this bill back in committee, so we have the opportunity to discuss these amendments and so we have the opportunity to get better answers from the government, because the answers we have received to the questions we have asked so far about where the money is being taken from are that we cannot answer that. One simply cannot answer where the money is taken from. And we cannot understand that in the Enhedslisten, which is why we would like to have the legislative proposal back in committee, so that the Minister will once again have the opportunity to answer our questions and so that all parties will have the opportunity to think about whether it was not better funding to take the money from somewhere else. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132459	There are brief comments, and I have taken note of the proposal to take it back to committee, but first it is Mr Beazley. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132506	Thank you to the President, thank you to the rapporteur. We had a long discussion about the proposal here and so I do not think we need it today, but I would like to ask the rapporteur one thing. A deal has been made where something has gone wrong. Either it is the government that has deceived the support parties, or it is the support parties that have not asked for funding. Something's definitely gone wrong. If it ends up that the amendments do not go through that means that the target group will not include any more and that it will end up being the poorest people who will still pay these 2.1 billion. kr. From the development aid • Will the Enhedslisten then still support the proposal, because it did not become clear in the speech? Will the Enhedslisten still support the proposal, or will it not be supported if we cannot change the funding and expand the target group?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132556	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132557	In the Enhedslisten we will not say no to helping people flee from Putin's war, and that is why we will support the proposal, but it is not with our good will. We would have liked to see this done in a different way. And Mr. Sikandar Siddique knows very well that in the negotiations I asked the Minister: will there be new money? For, of course, it costs something when the Red Cross, which operates our asylum centres, must have many more so-called customers in the store. I asked you about it. I was told: yes, of course there will be funding. Mr. Sikandar Siddique is very good if he listened in the negotiating room.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132636	Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132637	I think Mrs. Rosa Lund is a little sharp. Yesterday we had this whole discussion about how Mrs Rosa Lund had deceived the voters of the Enhedslisten by saying that there had been clear impressions of the agreement. But that is what I started by saying: leave the discussion alone. I would just like to repeat my question: has the Enhedslisten entered into an agreement that has not been asked about funding, and then signed the agreement and said: Yes, we are making that agreement, or is it the government that has concealed the funding, and then the agreement has been signed, and then the government has said afterwards that we are paying with development aid?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132712	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132713	Firstly, I do not think it is true that the voters of the Enhedslisten have been deceived. I just don't know where Mr. Sikandar Siddique has left. I now think that Enhedslisten is one of the parties in here at Christiansborg, which has the most clear foreign policy. Secondly, in the negotiations we asked for funding. I asked verbatim, is there going to be money for this special law? Of course, when more asylum seekers arrive, it costs money. I get the answer: yes, there is. In the draft that we will have on Sunday evening, there is another funding than in the draft that will be submitted for consultation on Monday morning, and that is why, Mr President. Sikandar Siddique, we are tabling an amendment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132755	Thank you. Sir. Morten Messerschmid, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132757	Yes, of course it costs money to help people who are in need. We are in the Danish People's Party when it comes to the Ukrainians, also very much agreed with that. What is so weird is why Enhedslisten has insisted on maintaining a bill which, in section 2, also allows Syrians and Arabs and other Middle Eastern people who are today in Ukraine, but who, according to the rules that apply in the rest of the EU, could just go to Poland or elsewhere, should also be able to come to Denmark when we know that helping one refugee in Denmark costs the same as helping 50 refugees in the neighbourhood. That goes completely against the logic that Mrs Rosa Lund is trying to represent, that is to say that you want some of these Arabs from Ukraine to Denmark, but that you do not want to spend that money because they had to be spent elsewhere. I mean, it's sticky in all directions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132847	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132848	I just have to say to Mr. Morten Messerschmid, that it is not natural law that development aid should finance the asylum system and vice versa. It's not a law of nature, sir. Morten Messerschmid, and I think, in fact, that I have pointed out quite clearly from the platform exactly the other funding, which means that it is not development aid that has to finance the asylum system. And I think that would be nice if Mr. Morten Messerschmidt would take seriously during the committee procedure.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132913	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132914	Mrs Lund must recognize that there is a majority against her, no matter how she turns this around. It must therefore be that as little money as possible is spent on this account, so that Mrs Rosa Lund has as much money as possible for all her development projects around the world. And that is why it is just paradoxical that her party in section 2 of the bill that has been tabled insists that people who are not Ukrainians but are Syrians and Afghans etc. should be able to come to Denmark, and in that way more of the money that Mrs Rosa Lund's friends in the NGO industry would have liked to have spent in developing countries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132950	Thank you. Then we'll get an answer. Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316132951	Well, as sir. Morten Messerschmide knows, Mrs. Rosa Lund is often in a minority in this Parliament hall. However, I would like to say to Mr. Morten Messerschmid, that is exactly why we in the Enhedslist believe that you should sit as little time as possible at an asylum centre so that the cost will be as small as possible. What we will not accept, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, is that people who escape the same bombs cannot have the same protection in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133016	Then it's mr. Mogens Jensen, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133018	Thank you. I would like to hear Enhedslisten's rapporteur if she can confirm that in 2015 we actually concluded an agreement between the government at that time, Enhedslisten, Radical Left and SF to take 1.5 billion. kr. Did Enhedslisten make such an agreement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133048	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133050	Yes, Enhedslisten was included in such an agreement, and it was also a very important part of that agreement, Mr. Mogens Jensen, that Enhedslisten, SF and Radical Left helped distribute this saving so that we could just look at what it was for some development projects we could put on hold right now, and we are also asking to be able to take part in this amendment. And as I said in my speech, we find it very difficult to understand why the government will not be involved in making the same deal as we did in 2015.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133118	Sir. Mogens Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133119	Then I think it might be interesting to hear if Enhedslisten has any idea where it is in the development aid you have to find these 2 billion. kr. that we need now and here for refugees in Ukraine. Enhedslisten has a bid for that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133133	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133134	Obviously, it's not the most fun practice in the world. However, we have noticed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration has a project to create a reception centre in a third country. We could, for example, do that project. Pause.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133146	Sir. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133148	If you spend 2 billion... kr. from the development aid of this bill, according to Altingen today, Denmark will be the country that receives the most from our own development aid. If it turns out that the price of getting this proposal through is that we will be the country in the world that receives the most of our own development aid, will the Enhedslisten still support the proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133213	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133214	We support the proposal because we will not say no to helping people flee. But I fully agree with what I sense Mr. Torsten Gejl asks, namely that the way in which asylum expenditure and development aid are linked is quite far-fetched. It doesn't make sense that we are now giving ourselves development aid, and I don't understand why we have to implement these DAC rules in this extremely rigid way that we are doing. They're not a law of nature. I mean, if a majority in here wants to change them, implement them in a different way, then we could do it. And we believe in the Enhedslisten that you should.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133247	There are no more brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. And I would like to know if there are any more rapporteurs who would like to speak in this debate. There isn't, and then we go to the privateists. First, it's sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133305	After all, an amendment has been tabled outside the report, and perhaps the debate is also a little vague, because not everyone has seen it in writing. That is why there is good reason why the draft law should be referred back to committee between the second and third readings. After all, this is an amendment tabled by Radicals, SF and Enhedslisten which indicates alternative funding. So it's possible. As far as these large amounts in the DAC system are concerned, the government's proposal was 300 million. kr., so why is it that the government will end up with something that is over 2 billion. kr.? There, I think, it is refreshing that the whole parliamentary basis is united on a different funding. I would just like to point out that if the government does not like it, then there are almost 5 billion. kr. that you can find somewhere else. You can look at the saved costs of supporting renewable energy this year. Support for our offshore winds, our biogas, the farm mills, etc. was something we played at the last budget negotiations. At that time, it seemed that by 2022 the savings in government expenditure would be 2.7 billion. kr. I have then asked in connection with some debates on heat checks whether we can get an updated figure, and then we got a figure here at the beginning of February when it was expected that it is now 4.9 billion. kr., the Treasury saves because energy prices are so high. So if you want to find funding somewhere other than taking money from the poorest, there is, in fact, an opportunity for it. And this funding thing is a political choice. It may well be that you have a long tradition of dealing with the costs of refugees in a certain way, but now we are politicians, we are not history writers or officials, and we can make another political choice when we want to finance the aid for Ukrainian refugees, and I think we should. I think it is a fair amendment that has been tabled by the whole parliamentary basis. If the government doesn't want to prioritize it, I'll just say there's money elsewhere. This is not just a loose estimate; it is, in fact, some money that the Treasury is saving for renewable energy. In addition, there is VAT on energy, which is much higher at the moment because of the high energy prices. And there are some of the poorest people who pay their bills for gas and then save some other places; so there will be no extra VAT in the treasury. But then there are all the well-paid MPs and the like who just pay their bill for diesel, gas, oil and what it was supposed to be, and there are some extra funds coming in from the Treasury. But it is a slightly more uncertain calculation that is around the extra VAT treasury. But we have, of course, seen the safe savings of nearly 5 billion. kr. This is an estimate from the beginning of February, and if we had proper time for a committee procedure, it would actually be fair to have an up-to-date note of what the current figure is today. I think it is really a pity that such a law should be rushed through here in two days just because there is KL's delegate meeting in Aalborg. Should we not give this legal procedure the time it takes to respond to the questions that have been asked and we will have a serious treatment of alternative funding? I think that would suit the Folketing. What we are facing is, of course, that we have a development minister who is faced with emptying the poorest plates in Sudan and Eritrea, while at the same time the finance minister can stack the money from the saved renewable energy expenditure in the Ministry of Finance. So there is another funding, and that is what I think the Folketing should relate to. There is, of course, a specific amendment and if it is the case that there is a proper committee procedure, then we would like to add to it that there might be other funding for what I think would be fair. It is not fair that it is the very poorest in Africa who have to pay for helping Ukrainian refugees.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133710	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133711	I must admit that it is as if the scales are falling from your eyes here, because I had actually sincerely believed that Enhedslisten was a party that meant it seriously when they spoke the social matter. Now I understand that the high electricity bills that are currently being paid by everyone from the richest to the least well-off in Denmark, and which are the reason why VE support should not be paid, are those which Enhedslisten believes should finance the efforts that they want to make to the refugees here. In the Danish People's Party we say: No, that money must then go back to the citizens. The people who have invested in a heat pump but experience that it has become much more expensive than otherwise, the people who experience energy prices being passed on to consumer goods, so it is suddenly more expensive to buy a medist sausage or a litre of milk, or whatever it may be, or gasoline for that matter, must have the money back here. But now we know the Enhedslisten again. It is refugees, it is strangers, it is all the benevolent out among NGOs, those who vote on the Enhedslisten, who apparently have to dispose of that money. It really is a day when the scales fall from the eyes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133815	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133816	I did not hear the question, but I would like to comment on it. The Enhedslisten tried, in the context of the negotiations on the heat check, to make the amount that comes back to the population bigger. At that time, at the start of the negotiations, it was only 2.7 billion. kr., the state saved, and it ended up with a heat check, which sends back a billion with another funding. In addition, we obtained 250 million. kr. to a real green conversion of district heating, and that was really good. So if we cannot spend the money in one debate, we will try with the next one, and now we have a legislative proposal in which we indicate that there is actually almost 5 billion. kr. I saved the state spending that could get into play with this, instead of emptying the plate at the very poorest in Africa. That is what I think is the agenda here and not such a characteristic of what Enhedslisten does and does not do. In this way, we have a suggestion as to how another funding could be, and there is another proposal which the whole parliamentary basis is behind, and I think that is a very good proposal as well.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133919	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133920	No, I actually think that what's interesting here is to hear what Enhedslisten does and doesn't. Because it is absolutely true that you made an agreement with your red friends to send back a billion, but you had seen the possibility of sending 5 billion. kr. Back up. There was not a single bourgeois party that was not willing to make that majority with the Enhedslisten. Can the rapporteur not confirm that the reason why that money did not come back to the citizens is precisely that Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen and his red friends didn't have the courage to do it when it came to it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133946	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316133947	I think that today's issue is about how best to help Ukrainian refugees and to find funding that does not take money from the very poorest in Africa, which is also being hit by rising food prices. There are a number of African countries where wheat represents a large part of the diet and the wheat is imported from Ukraine. So they will see that they are getting rising food prices, while there is some assistance from Denmark that is being significantly reduced if it is the case that we do not find any other funding here today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134021	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134022	If that's what this is about today, that is, if it's about Enhedslisten not accepting that we spend 2 billion. kr. from development aid, thus becoming the country that receives the most from our own development aid, the Enhedslisten will then be able to put its foot down if it turns out that it will be 2 billion. kr.? If there is no sensitivity to the proposal at all, if this whole debate is completely in vain, will the Enhedslisten consider withdrawing its support for this proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134059	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134100	I am not the rapporteur on this matter. I just humbly go to the platform and point out that I have 4.9 billion. kr. here, which a political majority can choose to spend on this effort to help the Ukrainian refugees. So I think that is the most important thing. And then we have a rapporteur in this area who has indicated the position of the Enhedslisten on this matter. However, we are fighting to the end to get decent funding for aid to refugees from Ukraine.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134127	Sir. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134130	I'd like to apologize to Mr. Knox. Søren Egge Rasmussen. I'd have been pretty impressed before Mr. Beckett. Søren Egge Rasmussen said that he was a privateist and in that capacity had gone humbly on the platform. What I wanted to say was that, frankly, it sounds like a free round. We are making this agreement, we are opposed to it, we are criticizing it, but for some strange reason we are entering into an agreement without knowing the funding. We still haven't gotten quite a hundred percent elucidated what's going to happen. When Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen is not the rapporteur, I am not going to ask a question, but just say: consider strongly in the Enhedslisten, if it is not now that you should put your foot down and say that you cannot support this legislation, which discriminates and goes beyond the poorest in the world at all, if you really believe that it should not be the poorest in the world who pays the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134235	Thank you. Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134236	Well, it's not a free round. It's a political choice where you'll find funding for this. It is sometimes very good when the Danish Parliament has plenty of time for a first, second and third reading of a bill and can find ways to improve it. So here we have seen that there have been some negotiations before the draft law was tabled, and when negotiations were held it was a much lower amount that would be taken from the very poorest. Then the government comes up with a proposal that takes over 2 billion. kr., and then we have a process here, which unfortunately is forced due to KL's delegate meeting tomorrow and the day after. Some are on their way to that party, while others in Africa can look forward to their plate being empty. This is, of course, the reality we are in the middle of here, and frankly I think that the majority of the Folketing should find another funding. The parliamentary basis has proposed funding, and I come here with just under 5 billion. kr. If you end up with a majority in favour of it, I will be happy, and it will not be a free round. So it is really helping the Ukrainian refugees without harming the poorest.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134340	Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134341	But it was, in fact, very humbly that I appealed for a reconsideration. For the truth is that if you vote in favour of the bill, you also accept de facto that it is the poorest people in the world who have to pay for us to make legislation that Enhedslisten himself believes discriminates and discriminates. So if you really meant this, you would say: we're gonna put our foot down, we're not gonna accept this; as your support party, we're not gonna accept this. That is what I am appealing to, because otherwise you will accept it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134414	Then we'll get an answer. Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134416	However, I have not given up here at second reading, as did the Greens. I stand and fight to persuade a majority in the Folketing to find another funding to help Ukrainian refugees in a way that does not take money from the poorest. That is what I, as a privateist, am saying, and if it is the case that you land on the parliamentary basis amendments for funding, then it is also very good. There are two alternatives to what the government has put forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134448	Thank you to the rapporteur. Well, that's the way it is now, sir. Morten Messerschmidt asked for the floor as rapporteur and therefore privateists have to wait. If there are other rapporteurs who would like to speak, if there are others who would like to speak as a privateist, in addition to Mr. Christian Juhl and Mrs Jette Gottlieb, I would ask you to report it so that we can steer the debate from up here. Here you go, sir. Morten Messerschmid, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134509	Thank you, President. After all, it is a paradoxical mask that we are watching in this debate. We have the Radical Left and the Socialist People's Party, which is afraid that, with funding, as has been understood since 1992, we have understood from Mr Vandemeulebroucke. Rasmus Stoklund, has accepted, takes money from Africa, but at the same time nothing is done to limit the number of people who could come here, so as to reduce the drain on development aid. Well, the thing is that when New Civil and Danish People's Party votes yellow today, when we get there, it is because of the section 2 that the Socialist parties insist must be in the law. You even insist so hard that you will not even allow the law to be divided up so that we could vote green to help the Ukrainians and then vote yellow or red to the others. No, we insist that people who may have a background from Afghanistan, Syria or any other Middle Eastern refugee-producing country should have a shortcut to Denmark via the Ukrainian law, even if they could already be in Hungary, Poland or somewhere else, they insist on it. And so it insists that the drain, the pull on development aid, gets all the bigger, while standing up here piercing over the fact that the law leads to a drain in development aid. It's a marvelous hypocrisy. Then we have the Enhedslisten, which until a month ago we were negotiating with, or at least took seriously in the bourgeois bloc, compared to the 4.9 billion. kr., which the state has put together today because of electricity taxes, and that electricity prices are so high that you don't have to give support to VE, you want to send back to the Danes. But suddenly you don't want to. So now they have to go to the strangers, yes, certainly to those I mentioned before. This means that we cannot count on helping the people who are experiencing rising consumer prices, rising energy prices, rising petrol prices, etc. etc. That's amazing. Then we have a government which has so far sung in wanting to bring together Denmark, which cannot even bring together their own red majority, which is putting forward a bill forcing two of the bourgeois parties to vote yellow and which seems to have no control over its own majority at all. It's really amazing. Thank you, President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134732	There is a brief comment from Mrs Rosa Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134736	Thank you. What's marvelous, too, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, is that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt does not relate to the very specific financing proposal that we have with this amendment. And the very specific funding proposal is about taking money from the defence agreement, and it is about taking money from the corona funds. That's where I think it would actually suit Mr. Morten Messerschmidt to deal with that amendment. Isn't it better to take the money from there than from development aid?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134806	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134807	No, of course not. Of course, we should not drain Danish defences because we want to help people coming from Ukraine. Well, I know that Mrs Rosa Lund is having a little trouble understanding that it actually requires a defence in order to defend Denmark and scare Putin. For the rest of us, however, it is essential that the defence not only has the existing means, but also more resources, so that tyrants like Putin and others another time shake their hands before they make it completely incomprehensible that is happening in Ukraine at the moment. This is not about resigning from NATO or spending less money on defence, Mrs Rosa Lund. It is actually about the opposite, namely that we arm ourselves, because that is the only thing that tyrants of this kind respect.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134846	Rosa Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134847	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt, it is now in the defence agreement that some money has been set aside for humanitarian aid. That's so the money we're proposing gets moved over here. So if that money has already been set aside for humanitarian aid, I really think that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt's argument falls a little short because it is not about that defence, then, Mr President. Morten Messerschmidt is on the platform talking about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134912	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134913	Mrs. Rosa Lund can speak the sun black. This does not alter the fact that the practice since 1992 of financing this kind of operation through development aid is fully in line with our objectives and that, of course, there should not be a drain from the defence budget at all, quite the opposite. I don't think we'll agree with Enhedslisten. I'm really proud of that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134933	Then it's mr. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316134935	It's a little weird that sir. Morten Messerschmidt does not reply to what Mrs Rosa Lund says that this amount has already been included in defence expenditure. Why does Mr. Morten Messerschmidt isn't on it, but is he starting to talk about something else? Then Mr. Morten Messerschmidt one thing that I find interesting. Sir. Morten Messerschmidt said that the government had forced two bourgeois parties to vote in favour. - Sir... Morten Messerschmidt did not elaborate on what was meant by forcing them to do so?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135008	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135009	I'd love to! When we negotiated this last Friday with the Minister for Integration, we have already proposed, as the Red majority in the Danish Parliament insists on what is Section 2 of the bill, which is about people who are not Ukrainian but are in Ukraine, as a result of the refugee rules, to be part of the package, to divide the bill into two. Because we believe that the Syrians and Afghans and others who may be in Ukraine will have such a strong incentive to come to Denmark when they get this shortcut model, as Mr. Søren Søndergaard wants to introduce that they will come in droves. After all, we can already see how people smugglers and so on. look at Ukraine in order to be able to exploit the flow of refugees that is there, so we want to vote against that part. I totally agree with that, sir. Søren Søndergaard will not, and I fully agree that the Danish Parliament today is left-wing in its majority etc., so that is why we asked democratically to split it up so that we could vote yes to help the Ukrainians and then no or yellow to the other part. In this way, Denmark would be able to show that 179 members of parliament were behind helping the Ukrainians, and that is the opportunity that the government has missed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135114	Then it's mr. Søren Søndergaard. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135115	I hope everyone will notice what is going on. Not only did Mr. Morten Messerschmidt not to answer the question from Mrs Rosa Lund, but Mr. Morten Messerschmidt does not answer my question either. I asked what it means that the bourgeois parties have been forced to do so. Sir. Morten Messerschmidt says that the bourgeois parties do not have their free will. They can simply refrain from voting in the way they have apparently been forced to, unless there is some coercive method, and I would like to hear what it is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135151	Thank you, sir. Søren Søndergaard. Then we'll get the answer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135152	Now, sir. Søren Søndergaard did not participate in the negotiations, so it might take some time before it leaks in. But the point here is that if you cannot vote 'yes' and 'no' and 'yellow' where you want to vote 'yes' and 'no' and 'yellow', among other things. Because Mr. Søren Søndergaard prevents it, among other things. By the fact that Mr. Søren Søndergaard insists that all the different elements should be in one vote, so it is impossible. But it may be too nuanced an approach to life than what Enhedslisten is used to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135218	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. Then it's mr. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135230	It is important for us to support the Ukrainian refugees when Putin bombs their country in an unbridled and brutal manner in the face of international law. Of course. We do not really know how many people are coming, and therefore it makes sense to consider how we finance it. My proposal is not about the content of the bill. It is about the cynical and inhuman financing that the government has put on the table. At least 2.1 billion. kr. We take away from development aid, which means that we take away one-eighth of Denmark's development aid. It has already been incorporated into the Finance Act what they should have been used for, but we are taking out the money, which means that there are some who are not getting the help we had promised them. It is claimed that this is something that happens automatically, so we do not need to discuss it politically. It's wrong. In 2015, there were big and long negotiations • Mr. Mogens Jensen just confirmed how to find some money. When the pandemic raged only two years ago, which means that everyone in this Chamber remembers it, we had to... I can't just concentrate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135354	We're gonna have to keep this conversation down. There's a chance to talk out by the coffee maker. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135359	There we had to find a larger number of millions of dollars in development aid and move them. And that means this isn't an automatic. It's politics. Now, on several occasions, I have suggested to the Minister for Development that I would like to take a look at where we can find some of this money in development aid, because we can certainly do that; we can at least contain the damage so that it is not the poorest and those most at risk who are affected by it, but what does he say about it? He says: No, Christian, you shouldn't be involved in that at all; that's what I decide. Or he says it in a polite way, because he says, "That's my prerogative." It's a fine word that means I'm in charge alone. We could do that earlier in 2015, and we could do it during the corona, but we can't now. I would say that if a majority maintains this cynical financing model, it is so unfair. They could take them, including the bourgeois parties, from that settlement of billions of dollars to the military. It could be done. Then there would be a bit of decency in it, because then we will pay it ourselves out of what will benefit the Danes if it also benefits the Danes. Danish development aid is at its lowest level in 40 years. From 1979 to 2019 it has decreased in percentage of BN, which is what we calculate it from. This also means that a whole lot of expenditure that was not previously covered by development aid is now under development aid. The local authorities' expenditure on refugees, for example, professional grants, which are purely professional grants, is covered by development aid. This means that we have saved extremely much on the money that should go to long-term and preventive aid, which must ensure that there are fewer refugees in the world. When we remove some of that money, everything else will become more refugees, and we will then have to decide on them. The Danes have shown that they will contribute to this situation. Last week they paid 185 million. kr. in the collection which the television had arranged for an enormous amount of money. Last Sunday we gathered for the People's Church's Emergency Aid, and they got a record result: 80 million. kr. People provide clothes, food and open their doors. They even drive down and pick up some of the refugees and say: " Come with us; we will take care of you. ' I am sure that the Danes also believe that the Folketing should contribute to this situation and not steal the money from the very poorest in Ethiopia, Yemen and Mali, who both starve and flee. And we have placed that money for them, but now we come and say: No, by the way, you should not have them anyway; there are some others who should have them at home in Denmark, because the Danes themselves do not have to pay the extra bill. Find the money in a decent and decent way, find the money so that it does not turn into cynical politics. We've done it before, we've done it before, and we can do it again. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135710	Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Henrik Dahl, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135712	Thank you. I just want to ask whether the rapporteur believes that Ukraine is partly responsible for the situation in Ukraine right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135722	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135723	I'm sorry to have to say this because I'd like to discuss it with Mr. Simpson. Henrik Dahl, but we have to do that another time, because today we are discussing how to secure the refugees who come to Denmark and find the money. I would like to devote all my energy to discussing how we find this money in a proper and decent way, so there must be Mr. Henrik Dahl wait for another time. I am also afraid that the President would intervene if I started to hold another foreign policy debate from here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135746	Sir. Henrik Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135749	I am sure the President will not mind the rapporteur answering my question. Does Ukraine share responsibility for the Russian invasion of Ukraine?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135756	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135757	If I have to answer briefly and unanswered, the answer is no.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135804	Torst Schack Pedersen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135805	In the written contribution, as Mr. Christian Juhl has previously given, on the situation in Ukraine, Mr. Christian Juhl a co-responsibility on Ukraine on top of the invasion. I'm just gonna listen, sir. Christian Juhl, about Mr. Christian Juhl regrets what he has previously announced in writing about the situation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135826	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135829	I have never given Ukraine any responsibility for the invasion by Russia. I have written some articles on minority policy in Ukraine long before Russia's invasion, that is absolutely right. We discuss them once and for all. I have never given Ukraine responsibility for the invasion that Russia is doing, it is Russia alone's responsibility.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135851	Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135853	I think there are more who have read those articles with a slightly different perspective. There are members of the National Executive of Enhedslisten who believe that the Ukrainians have a share of responsibility. What does Mr. Christian Juhl about the statements?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135914	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135915	We are now on an agenda dealing with money for refugees from Ukraine. Why don't we try to concentrate on that? I think this is something on the edge of the agenda we have today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135919	That, of course, is always a balance. After all, it is the Ukraine issue that we are discussing, Mr President. Christian Juhl. I understand that it is on the verge, but it is a broader agenda than just the economy here. Then it's mr. Morten Dahlin. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316135938	Thank you for that, President. The rapporteur was forced to say that if he had to reply briefly to whether it was Ukraine's responsibility, he would say no. Now I would like to give the rapporteur the opportunity to reply a little longer, because the rapporteur has actually dealt with this. In Jyllands-Posten, the rapporteur says: 'Is it really something the rapporteur thinks?
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140024	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140025	Ukraine has not had a particularly appropriate minority policy, but it has nothing to do with the invasion. The invasion is solely responsible for Putin. It is an attack war, an international war, and we have to say: stop that war, withdraw, this is quite unacceptable! And then we must show maximum solidarity with Ukraine, among other things. by ensuring that refugees can come to Denmark. And that is where we need to find a proper funding for it today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140058	Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140059	Now Christian Juhl repeats that Ukraine has pursued a non-intentional policy. Mr. Christian Juhl said several times before, and he also used the expression, that therefore the Russians could fish in touched waters. That's why I'm just gonna have to have Mr. Kim again. Christian Juhl to determine what his and Enhedslisten's position is on this question. Mr. Christian Juhl, that the so-called inappropriate minority policy of the Ukrainian side has no one at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140135	Yes, please. Then we'll get answers. Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140136	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140141	Then it's mr. Morten Messerschmid, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140144	I was just inspired by the answer that Mr. Henrik Dahl received from the rapporteur, and I promise that this will be the last time I shall be releasing the rapporteur in this way, but when he says to Mr Dahl... Henrik Dahl: If I should reply briefly, then the answer is no. I would ask the rapporteur to reply a long way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140159	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140200	Well, I'd like to do that. I'd like to invite Mr. Morten Messerschmidt I know that he reads a lot to read my article in Ræson, which I wrote long before Putin entered Ukraine. There I am trying to write something about minority politics in Ukraine. The article is available online, so I would like to encourage you to read it. Then you get the nuances.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140231	Then there is another rapporteur who has asked to speak. Here you go, sir. Jens Rohde, KD.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140239	Thank you. I have asked for the floor because I think it is a bit of a joke, and I shouldn't judge it, but I didn't have the opportunity to explain the KD's views on this agreement yesterday either, as I'm currently doing such a school tour, trying to explain to the children that they shouldn't be afraid of war coming in this country. That's why I wasn't here yesterday. So I would just like to say briefly that once upon a time there was an excellent Minister of Finance in Denmark, Thor Pedersen, from the Left, who had such a good point of view, namely that in politics we must agree to inheritance and debt, otherwise everything will end, and that is also the case when agreements are entered into in the Folketing. I personally feel that it is not the government's job to fly fried pigeons into our mouths as members of parliament, but that we ourselves have to ask questions when we conclude the agreements, to find out what is up and down, also in terms of funding, and, of course, when an agreement has been reached, an agreement has been reached, and I would like to inform the government that we are in line with our part of the agreement that we have agreed to. This does not alter the fact that I fully share in principle the view of the Enhedslisten and the Radical Left that it is absurd that we fund flows of refugees into Denmark with aid from developing countries. On the whole, there is something fundamentally wrong with our system of development aid, because we also have it with the fact that the money we spend on development projects that have some perspective is very often moved when there are emergencies around the world. So development projects lose every single time; development projects that should bring lasting improvements lose every single time there is an emergency in the world because the money is being moved. That is not very sensible, nor is it very sympathetic. However, we do not have to address this in such an ad hoc agreement, but we have to address this in the discussions on how we generally use and prioritise our development aid funds. And I would like to vote in favour of the Enhedslisten and the Radicals' proposal that this funding should be changed, but the problem of doing so is that it is not just about the 2 billion. kr. Well, then, I have to assume responsibility for finding the funding for making a systemic change, because it will set a precedent in the future, and if that is what we want, then we have to be honest about it, and then we have to be willing to find the funding it requires, because then it will always be the case that we have cut ourselves off from using development aid funds for refugees. Otherwise, this doesn't make sense, because it can't just be for Ukrainians that we do it. That is why it is not possible for us, because I simply do not have all the billions in my hands, to make a systemic change to the system, and that is why it is not possible for us to go in and support the amendments on funding, despite the fact that they make very good sense and they are sympathetic. But we have to address that issue elsewhere, and that is what I mean by politically having to agree to inheritance and debt, and we have made an agreement with the government, and we are, of course, on the goal of that, and the information we might think we have not been given along the way, we assume responsibility for that. But I have done this and we have done this and made an agreement with the government with open eyes, although we have a different position in principle, because there is a problem that needs to be resolved now and here. And then we have to take the systemic discussion of the use of our means of development in relation to refugees at another time. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140707	Thank you, sir. Jens Rohde. There are no brief comments, and that means that we can now proceed with the list, and that is now Mrs Jette Gottlieb, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140715	Thank you very much. This whole debate is about something as abstract as Denmark's reputation internationally. You cannot listen to the whole debate, but that is what it is. We usually pride ourselves on being at the forefront when it comes to development aid, and we have also tried to be at the forefront when it comes to helping the world's refugees. But now I think we have to go all the way back to the time when Poul Hartling was the High Commissioner for Refugees, so that this statement is true, and this is partly due to it. the way in which we manage our development aid, because we have created the mechanism that it says to transfer money from development aid to refugees. In contrast to the previous rapporteur, however, I would like to say that size matters. The mechanism of which we have served up to now has, of course, been of the order of 300 million. kr. What is happening now is that you seven times the amount taken from development aid, and not only that you do it, but also that you do it in the middle of a financial year in which the money is committed. Then you take the money out, and that means we have to tell projects that they have to close, that we have to inform organisations that they cannot get the aid that has once been granted, which has once been promised away. That is what we will do if we continue with that funding. I have a completely naive hope, and that is that when this proposal goes back to committee we are, after all, only at second reading... then everyone sitting here will send their rapporteurs into a debate about whether, when there are alternatives, we should not find them. Because now that we reduce Danish development aid as drastically as we will be doing in this year, we really are losing reputation internationally.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316140913	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. And now I am making sure that no more people have asked for the floor, because then we will be done with the debate and will have to vote in a moment. However, since we have been called to vote for so long, perhaps some have been sitting in the offices, so we are just waiting five minutes. However, to those who may listen to it, I would say that a few minutes will be voted on in this Chamber. I look at those who are in charge of voting and ask whether we are reasonably in place. I think we are, and we shall proceed to the vote.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316141043	Amendment No 1 shall be put to the vote. 1 by a minority (KF), that the bill is divided into two legislative proposals and can be voted on. The vote will end. In favour of 19 votes (KF, DF, NB, Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG) and Marie Krarup (UFG)), against 80 votes (S, V, SF, RV, EL, LA, FG, ALT and KD), abstentions 0. The amendment on the division of the legislative proposal into two legislative proposals has been rejected. That is why we are voting against the motion for a resolution. 2-6 to the split bill lapsed. Then we shall vote on amendments to the undivided legislative proposal. Amendment No 1 shall be put to the vote. 7, by a minority (DF and NB) and a vote can be taken. The vote will end. In favour of 19 (KF, DF, NB, Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG) and Marie Krarup (UFG)), against 83 (S, V, SF, RV, EL, LA, FG, ALT and KD), abstentions 0. The amendment has been rejected. That is why we are voting against the motion for a resolution. 8 and 10, tabled by the same minority, lapsed. Amendment No 1 shall be put to the vote. 9, by a minority (EL), joined by a minority (SF and RV) and can be voted on. The vote will end. In favour of voting 24 (SF, RV, EL and ALT), against voting 78 (S, V, KF, DF, NB, LA, FG, KD, Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG) and Marie Krarup (UFG)), abstentions 0. The amendment has been rejected. Amendment No 1 shall be put to the vote. 11, by a minority (EL), joined by a minority (SF), and a vote can be taken. The vote will end. In favour of 17 (SF, EL and ALT), against 86 (S, V, RV, KF, DF, NB, LA, FG, KD, Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG) and Marie Krarup (UFG)), abstentions 0. The amendment has been rejected. Amendment No 1 shall be put to the vote. 12, by a minority (SF), joined by a minority (RV and EL) and can be voted on. The vote will end. In favour of voting 24 (SF, RV, EL and ALT), against voting 77 (S, V, KF, DF, NB, LA, FG, KD, Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG) and Marie Krarup (UFG)), abstentions 0. The amendment has been rejected. As the debate has shown, there is a desire for the bill to be returned to committee. This also means that the day here will be a little different, because I cannot predict when the committee work will be completed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220316141339	But we will now take a short break in 15 minutes and then we will start the agenda item on questions to the ministers, and when the committee is finished I will see to it that the negotiations we are holding are interrupted in a sensible way so that we can vote on L 145. So keep an eye on it, because I cannot be exactly when the committee work is done. We'll take a short break in 15 minutes.
