ParlaMint-DK_20220420130000	The meeting is open. Today there are the following reviews: Minister for Business (Simon Kollerup): Bill no. L 167 (Proposal for a Law on the Danish Export and Investment Fund). Employment Minister (Peter Hummelgaard): Bill no. L 168 (Proposal for a law amending the law on occupational injury insurance. December 2020 to 31 December 2022)). Titles on notified cases will appear in www.folketingstidende.dk (cf. above). Members of the Folketing Lotte Rod (RV), Ellen Trane Nørby (V), Charlotte Broman Mølbæk (SF), Mai Mercado (KF) and Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl (DF) have informed me that they want to take back the following suggestions: Proposals for Parliament's decision to establish the partnership Together on Leisure. B 135). Does anyone wish to include this motion for a resolution? As this is not the case, the motion for a resolution has lapsed. Then I shall inform you that Question No 1 will be answered in writing.' 9 (pm. No. S 715) to the Minister for Children and Education by Charlotte Broman Mølbæk (SF) is deleted from the agenda.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130103	The first question is to the Prime Minister by Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130111	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130114	Thank you, President. Will the Prime Minister confirm or deny that she has informed the editor-in-chief of Berlingske that she expected that you have already been reported to the police in connection with the newspaper's history of Barbara Bertelsen's purchase of private telephones?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130134	The Prime Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130134-2	An informal conversation is being asked between me and the editor-in-chief of Berlingske prior to a press event with the same media. Generally speaking, I do not wish to comment on this type of informal conversation. So that's my answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130151	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130152	It is then in relation to the conversation or dialogue that has taken place or has not taken place, a view with which the Prime Minister stands alone, as long as Tom Jensen, Berlingske's editor-in-chief, has wanted to share the public with the dialogue that may have taken place. I understand that the meeting referred to by the Prime Minister is just before Berlingske chooses to bring a major article on telephone purchases among the employees of the Prime Minister's Office, as well as the fact that the Prime Minister himself has not been clear about which telephones were bought in the Prime Minister's Office. But such a possible exchange takes place between the head of the country and an editor-in-chief of one of the country's major newspapers, just before such an article is brought, where I assume that the Prime Minister has been aware that you were about to write this article. Does the Prime Minister feel that it would be generally appropriate for a prime minister to have had such an exchange of views or exchange of words with an editor-in-chief, just before an article could be published, in a country such as Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130306	The Prime Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130307	I constantly strive to have dialogue with Danish media, and that is everything from writing journalists to editors in charge and many others. And it's dialogue about everything between heaven and earth, I was about to say. And then I can repeat what I said before, namely that when it comes to two-handed conversations, I do not go into their contents.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130330	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130332	But would the Prime Minister consider it appropriate that a prime minister before an editor-in-chief, just before the editor-in-chief's newspaper had to bring an article that the Prime Minister does not like, threatens to report to the police? Well, to say that you assume that they have already been reported to the police can hardly be interpreted as anything other than a warning that if you print this, then it will be the consequence that it has. Will the Prime Minister consider whether it is appropriate that there could be such an exchange of views between a Prime Minister and an editor-in-chief in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130408	The Prime Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130409	No, I can rely on what I have already said, i.e. that I think it is important that we can have conversations with each other between media people and politicians, but this also applies to party colleagues and non-party colleagues between us without going into what may have been the content of discussions on a two-handed basis. So I'm not going to go into any discussions that relate to that issue, because I'm not going to go into a discussion of what I might have talked to an editor-in-chief about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130440	Sir. Morten Messerschmide for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130441	So, last of all, does the Prime Minister agree that the words of which Berlingske's editor-in-chief has referred to the Prime Minister, whether true or not, have the character of a threat to Berlingske's editor-in-chief?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130456	The Prime Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130457	I can again rely on what I have already said. Well, I will neither deny nor confirm nor otherwise enter into a conversation that has taken place between two people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130508	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you, Prime Minister. But we will continue with Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, who asks, but now it is a question for the Foreign Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130515	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130515-2	Thank you, President. In the light of the Government's guarantee of a new referendum, should defence cooperation in the EU be supranationalized, and bearing in mind that the Government's draft law for the referendum on the defence reservation is nevertheless likely to have to be amended as a result of the change in the wording of the voting slip referred to in the notes on whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs will take the initiative to register the Government's guarantee of a new referendum in the draft laws for the referendum on the defence reservation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130547	The Secretary of State.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130547-2	Thank you, sir. Morten Messerschmide. It can actually be said very briefly: the government is against a supranational EU army, the government is against abolishing the Member States' right of veto in the field of defence, and I can confirm that if any of it ever comes up with a referendum, and there is absolutely no indication of that, then we in the government will insist on a referendum. We have already made that clear, as Mr. Morten Messerschmidt knows, but it is clear that there are some who have an interest in giving a picture of a slide and holding onto a myth that an EU army is just around the corner, a myth that the right of veto will be removed in the mist and darkness of night. From the government's side we want to focus the debate on why it is important that Denmark now joins in and helps take responsibility in a situation where Europe is at war, but of course we are also very interested in killing myths. Then the answer to Mr. Morten Messerschmidt's question today is quite simple: yes, I will ensure that it is written clearly into the legislative notes that we in the government want a referendum in Denmark, if anyone should take the initiative to abolish the Member States' right of veto in the field of defence, or if anyone would think that we should have a supranational EU army.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130700	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130701	Thank you, Secretary of State. Now, of course, I have enjoyed the last few days, and I would like to say quite openly that it is very rare for me to really enjoy when the members of the government speak on the statements made by Mrs Trine Bramsen in her time as Minister of Defence, among others. I would also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his excellent work on this subject, and I would like to thank him for the work he has done. I do not know whether that is what the Foreign Minister is thinking about when he talks about myths, but if so, I should like to declare myself a mythist, as long as it is myths supported by the statements of the Foreign Minister's own party colleagues. Now the Foreign Minister says that he intends to write it into the legislative notes, but are we talking about the comments to the law, or are we talking about the text of the law? Because I note that the Foreign Minister says that this government will not do certain things without a referendum, but we also want it to bind subsequent governments. I do not think I disappoint the Foreign Minister by saying that I will do much to ensure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not a foreign minister after a parliamentary election, and therefore one could imagine that another government came along and the only way we can be sure that the promise made by the government here is not just on its own behalf, but that it is a guarantee that applies forever in the future, is that it is not just in the notes to the law as a statement of intent, but that it is, of course, in the law itself as a separate paragraph or a paragraph to a paragraph. So what are we talking about? Is it a statement of intent in the legislative notes, or is it a guarantee that should be included in the law?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130839	The Secretary of State.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130840	It is in the legislative notes where it is clear that if it should come to this point, which does not indicate that it will do so, it is not at all on the table that one would abolish the country's right of veto or set up a supranational EU army, then we will have a referendum in Denmark. I'd like to say to Mr. Morten Messerschmid, that I still have the merit of seeing that there is a party in Denmark that is in favour of creating a supranational EU army or the abolition of the countries' right of veto in defence. Maybe sir can. Morten Messerschmid inform the Danish Parliament of the existence of such a party. On the contrary, we are in agreement on this and I am pleased that defence cooperation is intergovernmental.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130915	Mort Messerschmid, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130916	Without having to go into too much detail, I recall that both the Radical Left and the Conservative People's Party last time we debated this was supporters of majority voting, but we can ask them that. What I want to ask the Foreign Minister is why it is not written into the law. So, if you want to give a guarantee or just want to give the impression that this is something that binds others than the Foreign Minister and the current government, why should it only be in the legislative notes? It is, after all, a much worse source of justice than the law itself. Well, it's with law that we build land. It's out here in front of us, and that's how it's been since 1241. Why shouldn't we write it into the law? I mean, if you really want to meet the "no" side and dismantle and dismantle all the myths and so on, write it into the law.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130955	Then it's the Secretary of State. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420130956	Yes, but it is written into the observations of the law and thus becomes part of the law. I think it might be interesting to hear and understand why Mr. Morten Messerschmid and the Danish People's Party in a situation where Europe is at war, where we have Putin with the most nasty war of attacks against Ukraine, where you break any kind of international law where he commits war crimes, which we can see pictures of from Ukraine, do not think that we should be with the other Western allies. We also need defence cooperation in which we also take care of our own security here in Europe. Why can't you support it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131031	Sir. Morten Messerschmide for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131032	I simply think that the Foreign Minister must be struck by some momentary hearing disorder, because it is precisely we who defend the alliance with the other Western countries that are the Americans, the Norwegians, the British, the Icelanders. That is why we do not want an EU defence union that divides NATO. But the Foreign Minister still owes answers to why he does not want to write this guarantee into the law, so that it also binds future governments and future Parliament, but just into the comments which are not, of course, near the same source of law as the law. Why can we not get it into the law if it is really to be a credible guarantee?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131105	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131107	Well, the comments to the law are a guarantee from this government (Morten Messerschmide) and all those who vote in favour, so I also hope that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt's party supports. And so thank you for clarifying that. In other words, the United States has just said, and I quote here, that the United States recognises the importance of stronger and more capacious European defence, which contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and which is complementary to NATO. So why is the Danish People's Party opposed to us all coming together and defending Western values in a situation where there is war in Europe and Putin has attacked a country like Ukraine?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131138	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Morten Messerschmide. The next question is to the Minister for Social Affairs and the Elderly by Mrs Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131145	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131146	Thank you for the floor, President. And I would like to say this: does the Minister believe that the follow-up group's harsh criticism of the evaluation of the specialized social area, which is particularly concerned with the fact that the evaluation does not follow current scientific standards and fails to provide important annexes, such as: The National Audit Office's criticism of the municipalities' management of the disability area gives rise to new initiatives or to delay the publication of the report once again?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131211	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131212	Thank you. After all, we have an ambition on the part of the government to ensure better help and support for citizens with the most complex support needs in this country, which is why we have worked hard and also for quite a long time on the basis of a genuinely specialised social planning. This is not a small exercise, and that is why we launched a major evaluation in the summer of 2020. For despite many years of focus on better data and knowledge in the social field and decisions widely in this Chamber in the social field of strategies and priorities of funds, there are still very large gaps of knowledge. The evaluation referred to consists of three tracks: in Track 1, a large number of analyses and studies have been carried out, including: provide us with new knowledge about target groups and what offers we have in the social field at all. And the criticism referred to in the question goes on the first draft of the summary reporting of that analysis work. Track 2 is the work in relation to a model to be able to introduce a real specialty planning in the social field. And this work together has been huge; there are 90 stakeholders who have been involved, and that model has been tested on more than 80 offers. Track 3 is then the solution track. This is very large and complex, which is why we also chose from the start from the government to create a follow-up group for the work with a very broad field of social actors. It has also been and remains a very good and necessary way of working. There is a good dialogue between the follow-up group and the Ministry, which is why it was also an entirely natural part of the process that the Ministry sent a first draft of the summary report on the work to the follow-up group on 4 March. It is also an entirely natural part of such a process that members of the followers then come back with their wishes for input, their desires for changes. And on that basis, we are looking at the product again. For people in here it will not sound like something weird; that is the way we work with hearings. And in this case, we have chosen to have a very comprehensive follow-up group for this work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131411	Mrs. Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131412	Thank you. I fully agree with the Minister that this is not an easy exercise. But the problem is that it will not be an easy exercise to follow up on this afterwards. And I can personally be concerned about whether we are going to have any continuous work done to reform this area after we have the evaluation presented, because we have come so far under the auspices of the Parliament, that we are in fact in danger of having a parliamentary election before then. And that's gonna be really, really a shame, because we've been promising these organisations for a very long time that we'll be acting on it. And I think it's the third or fourth time over a year that this evaluation has been postponed. And now it has been once again. However, we held a hearing earlier this year in relation to precisely the financial incentives in relation to the part of the compensatory reform which, like this one, covered this area, and it came out quite clearly at the meeting with these professionals, the talented economic wise men we had invited in, that there were some things that could be screwed up. Now we're sitting on the back of it and still haven't done anything more. I think we held this hearing in January-February, so why is it that the Minister does not call a meeting, so that we at least meet in the rapporteur's circle, too, at the back of both the hearings and all the input we have received from these talented professionals, and also on the back of the fact that this is a very, very long time since the Minister launched this evaluation and then sits down and starts to look at that part according to the results that clearly emerged from that hearing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131536	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131537	Thank you. I did not just get the answer to the last part of the questioner's criticism, namely why the report sent to the follower group has not dealt with the criticism of the National Audit Office. And I just have to say this so that everyone who follows it gets it that this report has been sent on 4 March to the follower group, and the Danish National Audit Office's criticism appeared on 21 March. Of course, as long as it is in reverse order, it has not been possible to include points from a report that has not been published and is not known in this follow-up group. But I am glad to hear that the Left is just as impatient as we are, and my hope is still that we can present the final analysis work this spring.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131615	Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131616	It's really mysterious that those results came. So, the criticism from the national auditors says one thing, and then there is the preliminary approach that has been to the evaluations. What we have heard for the time being about the evaluations is also what these organizations have been yelling at guard about shows that there is some discrepan in this. It in itself is a little mysterious, since you have done this, I would at least venture to claim that two long-term and all-round work on this. Then perhaps the Minister could not clarify that for us today: why is it that there is such a discord between the two?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131646	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131648	Thank you. Yeah, I probably won't make it in the 30 seconds I have now. In other words, a number of analyses and studies covering more than 1,600 pages have been carried out following the evaluation of the specialized social area, which among other things. is about the offers and the quality of the offers. The criticism of the National Audit Office is, of course, very much about the administration of legislation by the municipalities, for example. the far too many errors in the procedure. I have seen that some people have created such graphics that are shared on social media, where they say that there is "A" in one place and "B" in the other place, and that it is not true, but I am happy to discuss this when there is a little more time, so why it is a little signposted to make the correct layout.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131720	Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen, final question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131721	Yes, now I will try to do it in the 30 seconds, because I still didn't get an answer to it about that hearing either. Does the Minister not come up with something on the basis of that consultation, at least on the small part that deals with the economic incentives, where there is clearly a problem at the back of the compensatory reform, and where we can actually change it without going in and tampering with a huge reform? Is it not something that the Minister can simply pull off when we can now clearly see that this is a huge problem? Then I also have to say in ten seconds that DH are some of those who, among other things, are out to criticize this, and they have just asked why there has been no external economic study of the incentives that affect that quality in this area, according to among other things. the evaluation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131757	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131758	So let me start with the last one first. I also heard the rapporteur in his introduction being impatient and asking why this has not yet arrived. However, part of what has been discussed with the follow-up group has been a large number of requests for further analysis. If we were to carry out further analyses, we would not be able to meet the impatience of the rapporteur. That's why this has been about striking the right balance. I know there has been a meeting with my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs and Housing, on the issue of compensation in this, and I also believe that the questioner, or at least the rapporteur of the author's party, will agree with me that it is never a small thing to go in and start adjusting things in our municipal compensation system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131832	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the Minister and thank you to Mrs Marlene Ambo-RasmussenRasmussen. Then we move on to questions to the Minister for Health by Mrs Liselott Blixt (UFG). Enquiries are Mrs Karina Adsbøl (UFG).
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131846	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131848	Thank you very much. I would like to ask what the Minister's position is on the TV 2 broadcast, which was sent on 4 and 11 April 2022, where several people's identity is misused to be discharged from morphine by a guard doctor, and how the minister will ensure that a doctor does not print morphine to a citizen who addresses himself by telephone.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131910	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420131911	Thank you for the question. I'd like to start by saying that it's wrong to print these drugs over the phone. After all, these are very addictive drugs, and printing them over the phone is wrong. This is evident, for example. of the Danish Health Service's guidance on the prescription of addictive medicinal products, that the prescription of this type of medicinal product through the doctor, etc. may take place only in the event of new acute illness or injury and after consultation with a personal appearance or home visit. That is very clear. Receptive renewal for patients on long-term treatment should only be carried out by the doctor, etc. in exceptional cases, and only the minimum amount that can be required for the patient to be able to contact his own doctor. It also shows that the doctor must ensure the patient' s identity. In health care, we are constantly trying to minimise the risk of misuse of our systems, and this really requires some of the doctors who are here on the front line and responsible for printing medicines. I have to say that it is quite unacceptable that the guidance given by the Danish Health Service is apparently not being complied with, at least not in a few places in the doctor's office, as described in this TV 2 documentary mentioned by the questioner, and where it appears that some patients have been able to get prescribed medicines for abuse on the phone by doctors. I have therefore indicated to the regions that the guidance given by the Danish Health Service should be complied with. I would also like to remind you that both the CPR fraud and the trade in drugs are serious and criminal offences, and that is something that needs to be made clear. I should also like to add that, in view of what has now come out, I also think it is appropriate that we should look again at whether there is more we can do in the field of health. This is, of course, a balance, because we must not introduce such rigid systems that we are really restricting access to aid for those patients who really are in need of these medicines, but at the same time we must make it more difficult to abuse the system, as we have unfortunately seen here. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132111	Mrs. Liselot Blixt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132112	Well, I think it's scary that we actually have some rules that are being bypassed and in this way abuse some people's cpr numbers to get out substances that are addictive. That makes pharmacists some kind of drug dealer out there because there are many who become addicted to it. So I would like to ask the Minister: have they found out how they have obtained the cpr numbers that are now being abused? Because that's one of the worst things that can happen, this identity theft. At the same time, I would like to ask whether we can do anything to prevent this happening, for example. with NemID, or that when you have to pick it up at the pharmacy, you have to show your health card. You shouldn't see that in that show. Many people have asked me how to get your medicine without carrying your health card.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132204	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132205	There is what concerns the possible cpr-number fraud. It is a criminal offence, and I do not know whether it has been reported to the police and, if so, what the police investigation has shown there. If so, it is the Ministry of Justice that will be able to give an update on it. But I also mentioned in my reply that we must see if there are other things we can do. Well, some of the ideas I mentioned here, we have to assess. How can we do something that is not unnecessary leg buckles for everything that works in our system?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132240	Mrs. Liselot Blixt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132241	Thank you. Now we're all getting a health card. We even get one on an app, so we have every opportunity to legitimize us when it is. Why do we not think about the solutions when there are people who need medicine? Because I think it's scary to see that this way you can just call and get it. Because, of course, people who are in pain and in an acute situation need medication. If you've been trying to hurt yourself, you know how horrible it is. So we must not stop those who need the medicine, but we must stop those who get it illegally.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132316	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132317	That's what the challenge is. It may well be that it may be one of the ways we should go here, in other words to introduce it as a general requirement. But then you also have to be in dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry and the doctor and those who are in contact with those people. Because it is typically people who are seriously ill and who need very, very strong medicines outside normal opening hours. They'd rather have their normal doctor, but it's an emergency. And if they don't have their health card, what do you do? So there are some things we need to think about before we can go ahead with it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132350	Karina Adsbøl, the enquirer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132353	Thank you. I would just like to follow up on Mr Liselott Blixt's question in relation to what initiatives the Minister intends to take. The minister says that's what you're gonna look at. Well, what's the time perspective for this? What initiatives has the Minister taken on the basis of TV 2's documentary • The Queen of the Piller? The Minister says that he has drawn this to the regions, and what more? Well, the Minister must have some thoughts on how to make sure this does not happen. One is that there are some guidelines to be followed and followed, but the Minister himself must also have thought some thoughts about what it is then for a road we have to go in order to be able to shut down the possibility that it is possible at all for someone to abuse the system in that way. Of course, as has also been said, it should not be so rigid that those who need their medicines do not get their medicines; of course we must ensure that they do. But how are we gonna close this hole to this abuse? The Minister may reveal this, even in relation to what the Minister will do in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132501	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132503	It is quite true that I have indicated to our regions that the Health Service's clear written instructions should, of course, follow out on the individual doctor's watch. I have done so in concrete terms, and we are now examining the extent of this problem. After all, every case is a serious one, both for those who get the fraud with their social security number, but also for those who have an abuse which is maintained, that is, which is maintained in an abuse situation. In addition, the Danish Health Data Protection Agency has looked at various proposals for technical solutions, which I will look forward to discuss with the rapporteurs in the Danish Parliament as well. It is not the case that there is one golden tool that can be used. One of the proposals that has been examined is whether, if you had a CPR number where there is suspicion of abuse, you could make a mark on the common medical card in terms of possible abuse, but it is also like fire-fighting afterwards, so we are not quite keen on that idea. So this means that we are in the process of going back to the workshop and mapping out the scope and technical possibilities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132605	Karina Adsbøl, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132607	Yes, but then I just have to understand the minister about when this investigation, which is going on in the ministry, is going on looking at different options is finished. My colleague mentioned whether you could look at using NemID as an identification, i.e. whether it was an option. What's the time perspective for this? Because that is something I could understand in that documentary that has been going on over a few years. In other words, even if it is directed towards the regions, this abuse continues.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132641	Then we'll get the minister's answer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132644	I have to respect the fact that we need to find the right tools. I think it is quite true that at least the specific case that has been raised in the documentary has been going on over a long period of time. It's not that this fraud is happening all over the world in our society, but there are some people who are taking advantage of it and getting hold of this addictive. Let's see if we can do this properly. What I can say is that there is not now a drawer here that you can open, that is, where there is a solution that can just work. Because there are both pluses and minuses of all the solutions we have, so I can't give you a precise time perspective right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132719	Then it is Mrs Liselott Blix on the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132721	Will the Minister investigate and make sure that the cpr numbers that have been used have not arrived from a health care professional or somewhere else where it has been in some records? Now we also saw that it happened by entering the emergency room, because it wasn't just a guard doctor. Now we have to be careful not only to blame the guards. There was also someone who came into an emergency room and was discharged from morphine on a fake CPR number.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132753	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132755	Yes, and I am glad that this is also being said, because it is not about scolding on one group. Well, the guards are doing a huge job under very, very tough conditions. They do the best they can to help people with acute illness. But that is why it still needs to be tightened up, in all bodies, even if people can sound desperate and you want to help, because there is a reason why we have the rules we have. We must return to what the investigation of this is like; I cannot give an explanation of that at present.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132826	The question is over. However, we shall continue with a question to the Minister for Health, who has also been asked by Mrs Liselott Blixt. And Mrs. Karina Adsbøl is an enquirer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132833	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132834	Thank you very much. How will the Minister ensure that persons whose identity is misused, for example: to have morphine discharged from a guard doctor as shown in the broadcast "The Pill Queen" on April 4 and 11 in 2022 from TV 2, can have their incorrect information deleted from the journal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132853	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420132854	It's kind of on the same street, but another part of the problem here. Here too, it must be said that what appears from the documentary and subsequent newspaper articles about it is by no means acceptable. There should be no telephone prescription to the extent and in the manner indicated by the documentary and the doctor should ensure the patient's identity. Otherwise, these situations arise where there is an abuse of the identity of other patients and where the injured patient then finds that there are conditions in his or her patient's medical records which he or she cannot even recognize and which are quite wrong. It is also such a very, very important principle that ordinations should be recorded, but of course in the proper record of the person who has it printed, i.e. in the right patient's record. Therefore, it is primarily a matter of ensuring that the doctor ensures the patient's identity. But in addition, it is absolutely essential for our patient safety that we have correct and comprehensive records. The medical record is an important tool for health professionals, e.g. by tradition at shift change. The Journal is also important for the care of the patient's future treatments. After all, the Journal can ensure that the individual treatment is carried out on the basis as much as possible. So patient records are really good, but they're only good if they're correct. Moreover, they are also an important part of our entire patient complaint and compensation system and supervisory cases aimed at healthcare professionals and treatment facilities in criminal proceedings. So there are many, many reasons why we really stand guard over our records. There are also many reasons why so far it has not been possible to delete them, because what if something has been deleted and then something comes in and cleaned up? Therefore, I have to say that we in the Ministry, together with the Patient Safety Agency, are looking at models of how we can do something, but whether it should be a deletion or another thing is too early to say.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133101	Mrs. Liselot Blixt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133102	Thank you very much. It was a long story for exactly what it is all about, namely deletion. Whatever is done by measures to prevent it from happening, there are things that will happen. We saw on the broadcast a man who was in surgery. He didn't know his identity had been stolen to discharge morphine. The doctors mistakenly thought that he had been given this medicine, so he was given double strength. He could have died of it. I mean, that can't happen! So when something is written in a wrong file, then it should and should be able to be deleted.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133139	Minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133140	Yes, that sounds very logical, but we need to be absolutely sure whether it is a deletion or whether it is a different form of correction. It may also be possible to work with a correction, an addition to the medical record or a blocking of the information. What is the technically correct solution to ensure that we do not do anything that solves a problem but creates completely new, insurmountable problems in what is really important, namely correct medical records? That is the work we are doing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133213	Liselott Blix.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133214	I know that we have discussed deletion very many times in relation to something that has happened to the individual. This is something else entirely. You've miswritten something in a file that doesn't belong to it. I will certainly do my utmost to ensure that we can, of course, delete incorrect information, also because we can see that one of the participants had a blockage in his file that no medication was to be prescribed to anyone whom they were not sure of was him. And yet it happened because the doctors couldn't see the block because we have different IT systems.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133248	Minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133249	But I also look very, very much forward to dive into that work. It has proved to be technically and legally more complicated than finding models. When I say blockage, it is not to block any medication; it is to block the information and say that this information has come in by mistake or by abuse, and therefore it must be blocked for future use. Or can you make an addition, or can you simply go in and delete it? In any case, we must do something to ensure that the patient's legal certainty is not weakened in any way. That is the balance we are dealing with.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133324	Then it's enquirer Karina Adsbøl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133328	Thank you. Well, then, I would like to keep the Minister up on precisely the patient's legal certainty, because it is extremely important that there is nothing in your file that is not true. I would therefore like to follow up on exactly what the Minister intends to do. After all, the Minister is very accommodating when he says that he would like to look at that. But then, maybe a year later, I'm thinking, "Okay, and then what came of it?" Is there a time perspective for this? Is there a time frame for this work to be completed, for when these solutions will be available? One thing, as my colleague Liselot Blixt also says, is to delete incorrect information and also to look at blockages when should that work be completed? But then there is also the big problem that IT systems do not talk to each other. When is there a solution to this? So if the Minister could come a little closer to the timetable, then we can also follow up on whether the Minister has now looked at this properly and thoroughly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133434	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133435	Overall, what is seen is a model of outright deletion, so it is a model of blocking information because it is written by mistake or by misuse, and then there is a model of rectification. There are pluses and minuses on each model, and there are legal issues about each model, and we must at least be sure that whatever we choose for a model, it is something that can be implemented in the different systems we have in the Danish regions, that we have the economy to do so of course, and that we will not delete anything or remove anything that the patient stands and needs to be compensated for. That's not what we're talking about here, but it's just important that we fence it completely in when we do it. And that work is going on now and here, and it is not just the board that matters, because we also have to ask Danske Regions, because it is they who have the different systems, what it will cost, how it will be practical to have it incorporated into the IT systems. And when we have an answer to both the economy and the internship and the law in it, I'll call for meetings. When it's gonna be, I can't say right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133539	Mrs. Karina Adsbøl, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133540	Thank you. I need to see the minister about something. Is this work started on the basis of this documentary about the pill queen, is it something that's just started, you think it's gonna take six months to get a look at this and talk to regions and different people, or what do you think the time perspective is in relation to this? Perhaps the Minister could come a little closer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133606	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133608	It's always good when you get such good questions as I get today, and it's lucky I get them. I have been down to do some archaeological work in the Ministry of Health, and what I can simply see is that, back in 2017, it was under the previous government, it had begun to present the rapporteurs with the first note or at least one of the notes in this. You didn't go ahead with things, and it was precisely because it wasn't crystal clear what you had to do to solve problems in this. So it's not a new job, but we're working on it, and we've got some new information from the TV 2 documentary.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133640	Then it's Liselot Blixt for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133643	Yes, it is very fun to hear that this is an old problem that has not been addressed by several ministers, but it does not mean that we should not do anything now and here. The last question is in relation to the IT system. As I mentioned earlier, it is a question of someone who had been abused and who had been written that no medication could be prescribed if someone called about it. Nevertheless, it happened because it is the case that if you order it in another region, you cannot see what is written. Well, when do we get IT systems that work?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133716	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133718	Yeah, that's where the challenge is. We are so digitised, and it benefits us every day, but the systems need to be able to talk to each other, and they are often quick decisions. And it is all sorts of places in our health services, all regions, wherever our health workers sit and try to help the patient who is there, in the best possible way, from the information that you can get orally and that you can look up about the individual patient on a screen. Therefore, the information must be correct no matter where it is in Denmark and no matter what time of day it is. This is exactly the work that is not quite easy to ensure, namely that when we make changes, they are also correct all the way through.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133753	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the questioner and thank you to the Minister. We move on to questions to the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, but now it is Mr. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133802	Here you go for the reading of the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133803	Thank you for that, President. If the Minister thinks that Denmark should be a pioneer country in the field of animal welfare, how does it relate to the fact that in countries around the world mink growing is permanently banned while in Denmark we are now considering whether mink growing should be restarted?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133822	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420133823	First of all, many thanks to Mr. Carl Valentin for this question. I think it might be tightened up a little with the question when you talk about countries all over the world. If we look across the Sound, we have Sweden. They have had a temporary ban, as we have here in Denmark. They're opening up the mink again in the new year. We have countries such as Finland, Spain, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and a large number of other countries that still have mink breeding. So the use of the term countries all over the world is perhaps a bit violent, since even our neighbour Sweden, which we normally trust, has it, like many other countries. But thank you for the question. Let me make it very clear that the decision to cut down all minks by 2020 and to introduce a temporary ban on minks was taken solely on the grounds of public health. It was also only on the grounds of public health that a political majority decided to extend the temporary ban on mink teams in Denmark until 31 December 2022. I would therefore also like to stress today that the crucial thing for the government has always been, and still is, public health. Therefore, the first step is also that the Statens Serum Institute should make an up-to-date assessment of the risk to public health in relation to the reopening of mink production. When we get this assessment, we will have a political discussion on whether to open up mink production in Denmark again and how to do so. For the government, as I said, public health is crucial in terms of reopening mink production.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134007	Here you go, sir. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134009	Thank you. The last words about how the process is now were fine, and I know them well, and I know the process, and SF shares the government's view on health, and it is good that we are now looking at SSI's risk assessment, which I look forward to very much, but I think it is quite absurd to attack my question because I say that countries everywhere in the world distance themselves from this production. Then the Minister mentions some countries that still have it. Yes, there are some of them, but countries that are either phasing out or who have already done so are quite a lot. If I should mention a few, and I can do that, it is, for example. Norway, it's England, it's Ireland, it's the Netherlands, it's Belgium, it's France, it's Luxembourg, it's Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Turkey, Slovakia, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Macedonia. So there are quite a lot of countries in the process of phasing out this production, and they are for a primary reason, and it is animal ethics, and this wave is just in full swing, even in some of the countries mentioned by the Minister himself. The Minister mentioned Poland, which is a very large mink producer, but the debate is in full swing, and it is because there is a very large popular movement against it here. Fashionhouses are dropping what big companies like Gucci and Prada are opting out of, and consumers are morally opposed to mink production. Therefore, I think the exciting question here is: Should Denmark be the country in the world that produces the last mink when all sorts of other countries sort out this production and say: We can't take responsibility for what we don't think it's okay? Should Denmark then be the country that carries production again and, like the country to which you go, if you want to produce minkskins, because all the other places you cannot do so because it is simply unethical? I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134204	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134205	I just mentioned that there were a number of countries which still have the possibility of mink growing and which believe that this is justified, and here I mentioned among others. Sweden, which we know as a country we usually compare with. And it was just in that context that I was trying to put it in perspective. It should also be mentioned that the times when animal welfare has been measured in mink teams, Denmark has been mentioned as one of the countries which has an above-average level, and I think that is also positive in this context.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134244	Carl Valentin, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134245	Now the Dyreetic Council is so out to criticise the production that we have in Denmark, and they actually say that it is not responsible. After all, I can read from their latest report and there they write: the Animal Ethics Council considers that good opportunities for development are essential for the welfare of animals. The Council therefore considers that, because of their built-in limitations, very restrictive forms of animal husbandry. to ensure the welfare of the animals cannot be considered to be up-to-date and animal welfare in terms of current knowledge of animal behavioural needs. • • • •
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134318	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134319	I didn't hear a question, so there's not much to answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134325	Then it's mr. Carl Valentin for his last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134326	Then I would like to ask what the Minister's position is on the statements made by the Animal Ethnic Council and whether he believes that if we want to relaunch this production, we have to do it in a different way, since the Animal Ethical Council cannot regard it as responsible. I would also like to hear why the Minister has set in motion a ban on putting chickens into tiny cages, while at the same time considering putting mink back into small cages.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134359	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134400	Well, I can mention again that we have had a situation in which, for public health reasons, we had to make a temporary ban. And there too, in cooperation with the SF, we have made an agreement on a very, very large compensation, where we spend 19 billion. kr. (i) the cost of the tax-payer's money to compensate for, among other things, the cost of the tax-payer's money; The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations, and the proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances That is why quite a few people are considering starting up again. Now we have to see what the State Serum Institute says in relation to public health, and then we have to look at how many people start up and under what conditions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134437	The question is over. Thank you to the Minister, and thank you, Mr President. Carl Valentin. We move on to the next question, and that is a question for the Minister for Children and Education of Mr. Karsten Hønge, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134445	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134445-2	What initiatives will the Minister take to ensure that public employers create more internships across industries?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134454	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134455	Thank you for that and thank you for the question for which I share your interest. Let me point out three things that I think need to be done in this area. Two of the things we have set in motion are the great apprenticeship agreement, with which a multiannual agreement has been concluded on the number of sosu pupils and on the level of student attendance. The second point I would like to mention is then an agreement which is not within my own sphere of competence, but nevertheless we on the part of the government think it is extremely important, including in this context, and it is now a question of having apprenticeship clauses in public procurement. It is also an agreement that has been concluded jointly with the SF. The third point I would like to mention here is a slightly smaller one, but nevertheless, I think, important things following on from the question that is being asked here. I simply cannot get a clear answer as to why the number is falling in the public sector. That is to say, when I ask in my ministry why there is the dive that the questioner is pointing to in the preparation of this question today, we do not actually have a clear answer to it. In fact, I do not think that is good enough, and I would actually like to make a statement, and that is a receipt to the questioner for asking the question today that we, as a ministry, want to come closer to finding answers to that. This, of course, takes some time, and we will follow up on the other two agreements at the same time, so it is not because nothing happens in the meantime. But it is just quite clear that it is one of the times when you ask a question in your own system and where we just have to say that we do not actually have a clear answer to that. Of course we must have that, and I wish I could already give the clear answer. I cannot, and that shows the relevance of the question. Here the SF rapporteur has put his finger on something that we simply owe an answer to, and I have already asked the Ministry to find out more about it so that we can see that the rapporteur is right in saying that there has been a fall. It is so overshadowed by the fact that there has actually been an increase in the care sector, but we cannot give a clear answer as to whether this is due to the fact that, for example, there has been an increase in the care sector. are changes in the patterns of employment in the public sector. It could be one of the answers, and then it's one situation. It may also be due to laziness on the part of public employers, and then it is by God in heaven a different situation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134704	Then it's mr. Karsten Hønge. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134705	I am really glad that the Minister is taking it this way, namely that we will then have to find out why this development has taken place. For the starting point is several different agreements, as the Minister mentioned, but the agreement I have just referred to here is, after all, the tripartite agreement back from 2016, which left some very good clues about creating up to 2025 between 8,000 and 10,000 more internships. In 2016, there were 34,235 internships, in 2021 there were 38,379 and this is a good success, but it has only been created in private companies, which have actually created 4,44 more seats, whereas the public sector unfortunately has gone back with 132 seats. I am glad that the Minister says that we must find out what has happened here. I note that Ole Heinager, Managing Director at NEXT Education Copenhagen, says: "The public does not train the next generation of skilled workers and instead'steals' the very many of those who are trained in the private labour market. That's what he said to the Stock Exchange. And also to the Stock Exchange, Nanna Højlund, who is vice-chairman of the LO, says that the number is falling: "It is immensely disappointing in a situation where we need more skilled workers to such an extent. In fact, it can be said that if only the public had moved as much as the private employers, we would have already seen that we would have achieved the objective of the tripartite agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134840	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134841	Yeah, and that requires you to know. In fact, I was most keen that we should just put proper pressure there, but that requires, for example, that we should do so. is not about a changed business mix in the public sector. Because you can say that if you no longer have an electrician employed, you can't have an apprentice either. So we need to find out whether it is spiritual laziness in municipalities, states and regions that is the cause. Then we can exert enormous pressure, and I would like to contribute to that. Or is it a changed business structure in the public sector that does so? What we can see is that there has been a greater responsibility in parts of it where there is actually a marked increase, and this may indicate that there are some patterns. That is why I would like to give a commitment to examine it further.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134922	Thank you. Karsten Hønge, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134923	I'm really gonna wait around for that. Because it may be that what has happened is simply that you have fewer of these employees than we expect at the moment, namely sosu assistants, on whom the Minister also says we have a separate agreement. But what has happened here, at least as far as the figures are concerned, is that what you can call across industries has fallen, and then it is that things are going wrong. It may well be that this is because they are no longer employed, but we will have to wait. But it is absolutely necessary that we get it done, otherwise we will never achieve the objective of the tripartite agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134954	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420134955	Thank you very much, and I simply agree with you basically. We need to find out, and we need to find out what the reasons for this are. Otherwise we get the wrong tools up, and the variant to answer like this was to give a gossip to a gossip and say that we had put all sorts of ships in the lake, and the reality is that there is no clear answer to that and we simply have to find out what the answer is. That also means that I can list all the figures, and on some of them it looks super nice, and it actually speaks for the fact that it is not of bad will, because it would not look so good. And that means that we need to find out what the patterns are, and if it is spiritual laziness, I would also like to contribute to doing something about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135032	Sir. Karsten Hønge for his last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135033	Yes, and I also assume that together we have the same deadline. After all, we have the tripartite agreement of 2016, which says that by 2025 we must achieve the goal. So the work that the Minister is going to set in motion must be one that must be set in motion, so that, in addition to having it analysed and exposed where the challenges are, we also allow time for us to reach the target by 2025.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135054	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135055	It's just a promise. That is precisely what the objective is, and I would like to say that we now have record years in the field of apprenticeships. More training agreements are simply being concluded than have been done. Compared with some of the records, this is simply all the time that has been recorded and that is to say, we are in a booming growth with what is being concluded by training agreements, and it gives blood to the tooth in places where it then goes the wrong way. In other words, if this is possible in the large private labour market, would it not be possible to do so here? So I'm sure it's the deadline we're running for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135128	The question is over. But we continue with questions to the Minister for Children and Education, and they have continued by Mr. Karsten Hønge, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135134	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135134-2	Thank you, and that is, to say the least, a little related to the second question, and it is this: will the Minister explain what dialogue has been between the government and the public employers in order to achieve the objectives of the number of apprenticeships by 2025?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135147	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135148	I would certainly like to do so, and I believe that there have been two main tracks which are important in this context. One is the apprenticeship agreement, and there I do not mean the tripartite agreement of 2016, but also the latest apprenticeship agreement, where we have also had public employers on board and where I believe we have had a very positive dialogue about it and, incidentally, also an incredibly positive dialogue with private employers, and it is rushing out there with training agreements. Then there are also some holes in the cheese, and these are the ones we are talking about here. But it's one complex. The second complex on which the government has taken the initiative and on which it also has an agreement, among other things. with SF, is about the clauses that I personally think are extremely important. One thing is, of course, what can be employed by apprentices themselves in the public sector, but another thing is that, when you are a big consumer, you still buy 380 billion. kr. What the deal is about. So we have had that dialogue with the public employers. It is clear, then, that we are lacking a job here, and I indicated this in the answer to the previous question, and it is simply to clarify why it is that in the public sector, on the one hand, there is a huge increase in the so-called social sector, so that in the municipalities there is a willingness to take in lots of new apprentices and, on the other hand, there is a fall in some of the other professions. For that actually suggests that one is benevolent, and that means that it may have something to do with some completely different patterns, and there is just no clear answer to that yet. In any case, I think I have a feeling that I owe a clear answer to that. So we would like to look into that further.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135321	Sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135323	Yes, yes, and that is very good, because it is also connected with the Minister's answer to the previous question, so that we have to find out what it is. I think that some of the explanation can be found immediately. Well, the surprise of the fact that the increase compared to sosu assistants is really fine, while it obviously falls for others, is not so great for me. For there the municipalities have an immediate self-interest. You have a self-interest in training some sosu's, and it is therefore no wonder that it is increasing, because there you also immediately experience the pressure from the population that you want a better service where the sosu's assistants should be, whereas if you do not get an electrician apprentice or a carpenter apprentice with you to build the new playgrounds, or where it may be, you do not quite feel the warmth in the same way as you do when disgruntled citizens want some more sosu assistants. So I think some of the explanation will be there. However, regardless of the increase, it is still amazing that in February 2022 we have actually seen that there were still 7.677 active seekers at Internkplads.dk. On top of that we can also see that there are a number of young people, but also older ones, to say what has simply given up and which therefore does not appear immediately at Internklads.dk. But there are still so many, and what is also depressing is that that number has not actually moved in the last few years. And there it is only if we look at the number of people seeking internships while at the same time we want more people to apply to vocational training that things are connected. In other words, you can understand people who may be so reluctant to apply to an educational area where they must constantly be confronted with the lack of internships. So I think that the explanation here may be that it is not only the public sector that has to take over the whole task of training apprentices, but that it is also something that can help to tempt more people to go in and take these vocational training courses.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135523	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135524	In other words, the rate of implementation has increased. I am extremely aware of the figure, I would say, and the number of pupils who actually complete their vocational training is increasing. Unfortunately, we are not getting any more young people to apply, and I agree that these are connected vessels. However, I also believe that it is only fair to point out that you have to register at Internspladsen.dk. So when schools say they don't have anyone in the school internships now, because they all have apprenticeships, it doesn't change the fact that the pupils in question were at one time registered at Internships.dk. It may be that they were only for a week because they then got an apprenticeship, but at some point they have been registered there, and that means that what is the big question is how big a dark number there is. I met, among other things. a young man who wanted to learn carpenters, and he had sought more than 160 apprenticeships, and some of them had not even bothered to answer him. So there is both the story of those who do not get, but there is also the other story.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135616	Sir. Karsten Hønge, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135618	There are different stories about what we hear about, on the one hand, there are companies that are really looking for pupils and, on the other hand, we have the other icy reality where we meet young people who are looking for one internship after another without being able to get one. I am just thinking that the public authorities simply have to take the lead and show that this task is being carried out and that cooperation with private companies is also being established in connection with part-training courses, so that we can become involved in cooperation with private people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135649	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135649-2	I fully agree with that. I am very excited about the agreement on apprenticeship clauses that has been landed in the Ministry of Industry and Industry. I have, moreover, suspected that, unlike myself, I had been sitting and negotiating it or at least having had a hand in the game. In addition to the fact that public opinion has to take the lead, and this is something that needs to be done better, it is also a question of using the muscles that you have as a political consumer, so to speak, so that you can go in and say that you only deal with those who fulfil their apprenticeship obligations, and not with all sorts of others. You just have a lot to say when you come with almost 400 billion. kr. a year to shop for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135724	Then it's mr. Karsten Hønge for the last question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135726	Everyone agrees that there will be a shortage of skilled workers in the future. Well, that's funny enough education. Everyone is more or less agreed that admission to vocational training is too low, and the answer is funny enough to make the courses more attractive. That is why we need to guide, we need to lure, we need to tempt young people into some of our fantastic professional education. May I there, in parentheses, recommend carpenter training in particular. I believe that there is a need for a good, positive competition between companies, including the public, in order to attract more pupils.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135801	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135803	Well, I mean, it starts and ends with primary school. That is, when we have gradually organized primary school in a way that completely resembles high school, there is no wonder that the safe choice for the students is to take the general high school. That is why I also believe that there is a task ahead, and that is why we have set in motion a huge involvement project with the partners in the primary school, parents, pupils, teachers and local communities, also in cooperation with the SF, in order to have a more practical primary school. Because if, as a child and as a young person, you do not learn what other subjects exist than the academic ones, then the high school becomes the natural choice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135837	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the Minister, and thank you, Mr President. Karsten Hønge. Now I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration just now, but I would just like, as there are many young people in this Chamber, to take this opportunity to say: what you are watching here is the Question Time. It is the case that the ministers are asked questions by individual members of parliament no later than Friday before Question Time here on Wednesday, so they have time to prepare. And then there is a dialogue here, where the Minister first has two minutes to reply, then the questioner has two minutes to comment, and then there is half a minute to each. When I stand up, it is because they cannot quite keep to the speaking time; so that is a sign of it. Now we have come to the next question. It is for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration by Mrs Anni Matthiesen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135918	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135920	Thank you for that, President. Does the Minister agree that it is deeply inappropriate for Danish companies to lack labour and have open arms to welcome Ukrainian refugees, while long waiting times with the authorities restrict work permits?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135935	Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420135936	Yes, I agree that long processing times with the authorities should not hinder Ukrainian displaced persons from being able to start working quickly in Danish companies. The Ukrainians who come here must be ensured the best possible conditions to be able quickly and effectively to continue their lives and actively to be part of the Danish working community. For this reason, on 16 March, a majority in the Folketing adopted a special law providing that persons who have been expelled from Ukraine may obtain a temporary residence permit in Denmark. The authorities are working hard to process applications under the special law, and a number of measures have been taken so that Ukrainian displaced persons can get to work as soon as possible. It is the Foreigners' Authority which is responsible for dealing with the applications submitted and the law lays down a shorter and less extensive procedure than for ordinary asylum cases. The authorities therefore have full focus on having cases settled as quickly as possible, but there is a need to do more, which is why I have also decided that from Friday it will be possible for persons who have applied for a residence permit under the special law to start work in Denmark at the moment the person has applied for a residence permit if the person has been admitted biometric. This is the part about taking a picture and getting a fingerprint.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140052	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140053	Thank you. I had hoped that the Minister would confirm that, because I can then reveal that while I was sitting in this Chamber waiting for my turn to ask questions, I could read Ritzau here at 9 a.m. 13.30 where the Minister was out saying that from Friday he will change it so that the mere fact that an application had been made would ensure that one could go to work immediately. I really just need to get the Minister's confirmation of that. Because it is clear that if I had read the press release this morning, it might perhaps have been that I could have drawn this question in the Chamber. But I am, of course, pleased that something is going to happen. However, is it correct to understand that from Friday it is only that an application for a residence permit has been made which opens up the possibility of going to work as a Ukrainian refugee?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140147	Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140150	Yes, and I fully understand that it is of course a little difficult to navigate after such news comes out. I just approved last night that we are making a change in what is called the Aliens' Order, which means that from Friday, the people who have been given their fingerprints and had a photo taken and signed the application form can, in principle, be recruited. Then we'll have to sort out all the tax cards and social security numbers and whatever else it takes. Because we should not have so many people in Denmark who would like to work while at the same time having companies that have open jobs. It's ridiculous if we can't make it work better.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140223	Anni Matthiesen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140225	But I can only say that I agree with the Minister that it is completely stupid that they should not be helped on the way to getting started when they really want to, and especially in the situation where we also need labour at the same time. I can say that in the area I come from, at least, there are a great many companies waiting for some Ukrainian refugees, who hopefully also want to help, and that is also what I hear when I talk to the Ukrainian refugees that they really want to get started. So thank you, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140254	Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140256	You're welcome. It has been a wish from the business community for some time, and there are 23,000 who have submitted an application under the special law. There are 5 000 people who have been granted a residence permit, so there are 18 000 who can work from Friday. Children who form part of it must be deducted from it. But it is quite a lot of thousands of people that the Danish labour market actually has access to from Friday.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140317	Does Mrs Anni Matthiesen want the last question?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140321	No more than to say that we can use Wednesday's questions to put pressure on a minister. I can at least say that there have been a number of Liberals who have stood here and for that matter have also been in the newspapers and so on. to appeal for something to happen in this area. And that is what, fortunately, is going to happen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140341	Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140343	Yes, and I would also like to stress that this is not normal. Normally you get the residence permit first and then you have access to the labour market. But so many people have arrived in such a short time that the piles of cases have grown so high that I do not really think it makes any sense to ask people to wait for their turn. But at the same time it is also a declaration of confidence in the Danish labour market, and I hope that Danish companies will welcome the Ukrainians and that we will not have to look up the newspaper in a few weeks' time and see that people are being abused and that the legislation is not being complied with and one with the other with the third. So it is also an appeal to the Danish business community to show off on its best side when you receive the Ukrainians.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140414	Thank you. The question is over. However, we continue with questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration, continued by Mrs Anni Matthiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140420	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140422	Does the Minister agree that it is extremely untenable that a new division of SIRI has still not been established in South Jutland, when thousands of Ukrainian refugees in those weeks cross the Danish-German border?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140434	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140435	Thank you for the question. We are, of course, concerned that contact with the authorities in Denmark should be as easy as possible, and this also applies to international workers and displaced persons from Ukraine. We have a clear ambition that displaced persons from Ukraine should enter the labour market as soon as possible, and that is why we have a total of four centres for the reception of international immigrants. These are the ones we call ICS centres in our daily speech, located in Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense and Copenhagen, where foreign workers and job seekers can receive guidance and help with the necessary paperwork. The centres are currently operating in cooperation between the host municipality in which they are located and the administration called SIRI, which belongs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As far as I'm concerned, this ICS centre model is a really good solution, because all relevant citizens' services for international settlers are assembled under one roof. Therefore, it is also natural that SIRI's presence in South Jutland is thought into this center model, and thus we will create the best and easiest solution for international settlers when they enter Denmark and have to start their work or study life. In addition, SIRI has been present in Citizen Service in Aabenraa Municipality since 2019, where the board can provide the same services as they do in these centres. But the lease for SIRI expired here on March 1, 2022, and therefore we are working on establishing two new centres where international settlers can get the same services as they can today in Aabenraa, plus a little extra. For example: In an ICS centre it will also be possible to obtain guidance on relevant issues outside SIRI's area, such as the issue of tax cards and the Danish tax system. No final decision has been made on the location of the centres, but for me it is quite natural that one is located in South Jutland when we already have locations in North Jutland, East Jutland, Funen and on Zealand, and therefore I am very happy that in January the government could conclude an agreement with the SF, Radical and Christian Democrats, where we set aside more money for the establishment and operation of two new centres. Now that we are on the initiative of Anni Matthiesen and are discussing the conditions of international immigrants, I would just like to say that I also hope that the Left can support the bill which is precisely about strengthening the recruitment of international labour and which is being dealt with in the Parliamentary Chamber over these weeks.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140652	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140653	Thank you. It has been asked about this in the past, and I really think that it is quite natural when you like me live in South Jutland, but are also chosen in the area that you keep an eye on these things. That is to say, you get regular inquiries about why this new office has not yet been created. I have also asked myself about this in the past. Some of my colleagues have also asked about this. Now, in the previous question, the Minister has revealed how Ukrainian refugees can now be brought into work from Friday. Could the Minister also today reveal when the final decision will be taken on the location of these new offices?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140742	Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140743	Unfortunately, I cannot lift the veil for setting a date on that. This is something that must be decided after there has been a dialogue with the National Association of Municipalities, because the centres are run in cooperation with the municipality where the centre is located. All I have said is that there will be two new centres, and one will certainly be located in South Jutland. This is because the existing centres are located in the four major university cities and it makes very good sense for many different reasons, because there are very many foreign students coming to those cities. But we also have many large Danish export companies located outside the cities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140818	Mrs. Anni Matthiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140819	Yes, I can just say that among other things. In my work on the committee, I also meet people who really ask about this. So how long is it going to take before they get this new office? For it has been people who may have just approached Aabenraa in the past and where they think there is quite a long way to go either to Odense or, for that matter, other major cities for help. But as I understand it, the Minister says it is because it requires dialogue with the KL before it can be decided. Is this a dialogue that the Minister will address?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140854	Minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140855	Yes, and what has also been a little challenged here is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the KL have also had tasks for up to both ears with the reception of Ukrainians. This cannot be an excuse forever, but it has certainly been an explanation so far. But it's a priority for me to open these two new centres for obvious reasons, one of which is to be located in South Jutland. I think it is quite obvious that in a border region where, for obvious reasons, there are many foreigners, there is also easy access to the various authorities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140928	The last question to Mrs Anni Matthiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420140930	Now I am not going to give more advice to the Minister, but in these times when you can make digital meetings, also for that matter with representatives from KL, and if that is what is missing in order to actually put the dot on the map in South and South Jutland for where this new office is going to be, can the Minister not get it in place now? Then I am free to have to ask the Minister again during the Wednesday Question Time on the same subject.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141000	Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141001	I would very much like to have the location the next time we meet in the Wednesday Question Time. I also just have to be sure, when we decide on the location, that it is, of course, a right decision, both factually and professionally, where the centre is located, but also that this is done in cooperation with the municipalities that are involved. Because we have an interest that the center can stay there for a long time and get established and that it should not move around all the time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141025	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you to the Minister and thank you to Mrs Matthiesen. We will continue with questions to the Minister for Employment, and now it is by Mr. Bent Bøgsted, and co-questioner is Mrs Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141037	Here you go, sir. Bent Bøgsted for reading the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141041	Thank you for that, President. What is the Minister's position and expectations regarding the outcome of the future process of shortening waiting time in industrial injury cases as a follow-up to the series of thematic meetings held prior to the forthcoming negotiations on a new labour injury reform?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141056	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141057	Thank you very much for the question. As I also hope the questioner is aware, I am very concerned about creating a system of occupational injury where people who have been injured in their work meet a system that deals with the case of the injured person as quickly as possible and where there is a focus on good case-by-case proceedings. At the same time, it is important that the focus is on the fact that more people maintain their links with the labour market even after an injury to the labour market. That is why, in spring 2021, I also set up a technical working group with the social partners to identify the challenges in this area. They were to illuminate and identify the actual conditions in the area of occupational injury based on figures and facts. I have not yet received the reporting of the parties. When I receive the report, it will be forwarded to the Employment Committee and hopefully provide a good basis for us as politicians to take the baton forward. I hope that, in this context, it will be possible to reach a political agreement with the improvement of the occupational injury system, which will lead to shorter procedures.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141159	Bent Bøgsted, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141200	Thank you, Minister. That is precisely what is interesting. After all, there were a number of thematic meetings which went through how the occupational injury system works today and where there were some problems. One of the last things the Minister said was that the Minister would then contact the social partners and discuss it with them. It's about a year ago or something. Then the question is: how long do they really have to take to find a solution? What is happening is that it is being dragged on, and then it ends up with the Prime Minister putting out elections before any results have been achieved, and then we can start over after an election by looking at the occupational injury system. Then the question is whether we should then go through a new round of thematic meetings and a new process with the social partners. Because there is no such prospect that something will happen here in the spring at least. And then I do not know whether the Minister expects any results from the social partners in the autumn, i.e. whether a deadline has been set for them to give an input to the Minister on this. This is also what is interesting, i.e. whether the Minister himself participates in the negotiations with the social partners, or whether it is something that they should talk about and then give an input to the Minister. Because if it may be a bit difficult to agree and there is no deadline set for them to be, then I can see that time is running out, and then suddenly we have a parliamentary election. We've seen that before. The previous government was also discussing the need for something to be done in the form of a new labour injury reform. It drowned there, and then elections were released, and then we could start over. It is commendable that the Minister set these thematic meetings in motion, but my fear is that we will end up in the same situation, namely that we can start again after a new election.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141357	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141358	Let me start by saying that we have no wish that we should start over. The Committee of the Parties which has been set up does not have the character of tripartite discussions either, and in this way I am not part of the discussion with the social partners either on behalf of the government. The parties have been set to jointly provide some input to the Danish Parliament's parties on how best to reform the occupational injury system, something that is based on the thematic discussions we have had. As soon as the Committee of the Parties reports, we shall call for genuine political discussions and debate on what a change in the system of occupational injury might look like.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141434	Thank you. Bent Bøgsted, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141435	What is involved is the fact that there are a great many people who have been injured and who have some cases that are dragging on. They see no solution to it. They can see no end to when they get a decision. And the minister and former ministers of the government it is not just a red government; it is also a blue government that has promised to reduce the waiting time and promised that it should not take so long before anything happens. But this process that has taken place means that from the previous government until now, four years have passed, when nothing has happened. And those who have been injured are still waiting.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141508	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141509	Well, it is an important task both for the deliberations of the Committee of the Parties, but indeed also in the political negotiations that we must have, as soon as the Committee of the Parties reports, to adjust and change the system so as to reduce the processing time. I very much agree with the questioner on this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141528	Then it is co-questioner Mrs Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141531	Thank you. I would say to the Minister that we are reasonably impatient now. Because we have to go back to December 2019, when my colleague and I called for a question debate here in the Parliamentary Chamber about precisely the work injury system. Since then, nothing has happened in the occupational injury system in the form of improvements for those who have been injured. After all, the minister has set this work in motion and it has simply taken too long. The task description I have on technical discussions on the area of occupational injury states that these discussions should have been completed in November 2021, after which it should have been reported to the government. That is why I would like to hear from the Minister: does the Minister himself think that this is satisfactory to all those who have suffered an occupational injury? It is also the case that the former government of Helle Thorning-Schmidt changed the early retirement pension reform and flex jobs, which means that you simply have to be 5 years in a process of clarification and get a flexible job before you can finally complete your decision on a job injury. Is that fair?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141637	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141638	We fully share the frustration about it, but also the desire to change the system of occupational injury in such a way that there are both shorter processing times and so that we may also see a more reasonable but compensation for some of those who are injured. As I think the questioner is well aware, the occupational injury system is hyper, hyper complex. That is also why we have asked the parties to provide input on top of the thematic discussions that we have had and that, as soon as we are prepared to do so, we will be able to call political debates, and also debates, in which I hope the questioner or the questioner will be able to take part in one way or another, even if they are currently outside the group.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141726	Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141727	Thank you. I can say, on behalf of both of us, that we are happy to take part in constructive negotiations, because it is our concern to change this, because there are simply citizens who are getting into a mess. I must therefore also say to the Minister that it is very unsatisfactory that this work has not been completed. We have citizens who are still waiting, and we have citizens who still have to go through a system at least for five years and then get a flex job before you can complete your work injury. One is the Rigsaudit's criticism about the long processing times, but the other is also very important. So when exactly is it that something is going to happen? When will the Minister convene? What's the deadline for this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141809	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141809-2	I cannot set a precise date today. I have no grounds for this, other than to say that we too, on the part of the government, have a wish that we can get these discussions started as soon as possible. Because I share the frustration of the questioner and the wish that we should do something about this. However, I also think that the thematic discussions revealed that there are some very, very complex case reviews which help to make the processing times long. And that is where, hopefully in the political negotiations, we can turn on some buttons, which then shortens the processing time to the delight and benefit of the individual victim.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141844	That's how it is, sir. Bent Bøgsted with the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141848	Thank you for that, President. Finally, does the Minister expect there to be a proposal from the social partners here during the summer or autumn so that a bill can be negotiated in place in the autumn, which can be submitted for consultation, so that we can have a first and second reading and adoption before elections are held next year? Does the Minister expect this to happen?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141917	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141919	Now I'm not sure I heard the whole question. I do not expect us to be able to negotiate and pass a law on it before this summer. But it is clearly still the ambition of the government that changes and improvements should be made to the area of occupational injury during this parliamentary term.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141938	Thank you to the Minister and thank you to the authors. So we have come to Question No 1 by Mr de la Malène and others. 13, and this is a question for the Minister of Education and Research by Mr. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141949	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420141953	Thank you. To what extent, in the Minister's view, can Chinese researchers and the espionage threat be equated, for example, if a researcher is on scholarship from the Chinese state or has previously worked on military applications or similar projects?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142008	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142009	Thank you for the question. Denmark is a world leader in research, innovation and technology in a number of areas and is well placed in many areas. It helps to create a significant income base for the Danish economy, but it also makes Denmark an attractive target for foreign states and for possible espionage etc. PET notes that foreign intelligence services are constantly trying to build contacts with students, researchers and companies that would be able to provide information on the latest Danish technology and research. Foreign students and researchers in Denmark can, knowingly or ignorantly, contribute to transferring sensitive knowledge to foreign states. It is a risk that Danish educational and research institutions should take very seriously. This is something that I am focusing on in my dialogue with them, and it is my clear impression that they are doing so and that they are aware that times are changing in this area too. International cooperation is necessary for the Danish educational and research institutions, for Danish companies and for Danish economy. It provides visibility and access to talents and research infrastructure, it provides access to the latest knowledge, and it is an important piece in Denmark's economic diplomacy. Although there are states and people who will do much to get their hands on Danish research or to engage in influence activities, this does not mean that all foreign researchers, teachers or students have unclean flour in the bag. And we need to have contacts with research institutions and researchers from other countries, which are also well advanced in various important areas of research. In other words, there can be no direct similarity between international cooperation and security risks, between foreign persons in general and security risks, or between persons from specific countries and security risks. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142205	Sir. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142207	Thank you for your answer. But I still think that I got about the same answer that I have received on the written questions I have asked in the past, which are actually the reason why I ask the Minister to come back here. I therefore agree that there is a great deal of good to have global research cooperation, but the challenge is just that we have the assessment from PET that China openly and directly collects information. I have an answer from the Minister, who says that the Minister is also concerned when the Minister reads PET's assessment of the espionage threat in Denmark, and that the Chinese secret services have wide powers to collect information from Chinese companies, organisations and individuals, no matter where in the world they are. At the same time, the Minister says, and I can follow this as well, that there can be no direct resemblance between Chinese researchers and students and security risks. But how do we distinguish? When exactly will there be a security risk? When are we going to say that these people are not going to cooperate with us? For what the minister says is that if Chinese researchers and students get a knowledge, they have a duty to deliver it to their hinterland at home if some people want to use that research. When researching artificial intelligence, we do have some very ethical dilemmas and challenges as to how it is used. And we know very well that it is being used in China in a dubious way in order to control the population and control what is going on in the population. So how are we going to distinguish? When is it that we can equate Chinese researchers with students with the risk of espionage? That is why I specifically ask about researchers who are here on a scholarship from the Chinese state. Are there any people on whom we have to say that there is a challenge?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142414	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142415	This is a wildly interesting and also important discussion, and we have also had it in consultation in the Education and Research Committee, and we are going to have to have an ongoing discussion and collaboration with Danish educational and research institutions on how to behave well, wisely, wisely and securely when doing an international research collaboration, so that you can do it in a way that is beneficial to Denmark. There we must have a targeted approach and look at where we benefit from doing so, but at the same time we must ensure that we protect ourselves and do not contribute to things that we do not think we should contribute to by Danish. I actually see that there is a broad political consensus on this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142456	Sir. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142457	I still do not think that I am getting precise answers to what I am asking. Let us now try to cut to the bone and say: We have some Chinese researchers who are here on a scholarship from the Chinese state; if such researchers on a scholarship could come in and collaborate with Danish researchers at Danish universities, would that be okay at the Minister's discretion?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142521	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142522	There were only 30 seconds to answer, and I regret that I did not make it all around. But there are now some clear areas where there are some limitations. That is, for example, the case. in the military field. But otherwise I think it is difficult to say that it is precisely a criterion that makes it not work, and that is whether it is China or one of the other countries that PET has mentioned its report. There has to be a culture and awareness of how to organise the cooperation and what to be aware of in order to avoid that we do not contribute to things that we do not think Danish researchers should contribute to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142601	Sir. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl for the last question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142603	Then I would just like to try again: if we have a researcher who is paid by the Chinese state, can we not have an assumption that the researcher in question has a certain obligation to report back on whatever he or she may find out? One must actually be able to say that this researcher must obviously be a security risk in relation to the surrender of research from Denmark to China. So we should actually say that we have a limit here and we must be able to say that there is at least a level on which we say that we cannot accept it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142640	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142642	But some of the challenges that have been identified are, for example: related to a foreign talent program, and being on another state's payroll is, of course, one of the things you should be aware of, and the places where you do research cooperation. But if it is in a field where it is entirely beneficial for both countries that you have a cooperation • it can be in the health or other areas • and where there is not immediately considered to be a real risk, that is the filter that you have to put down over it. So it is more refined than that, because it must also be about what area it is and whether you think it is structured in a way that can be done in a safe and credible manner. We will be discussing a lot and working together on that, I am convinced.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142731	Thank you to the Minister, thank you to the author. The question has been answered. That concludes Question Time and we can go to the next item on the agenda.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142743	The debate has been opened, and the first rapporteur comes from the Social Democratic Party, and that is Mr Seligman. Thomas Jensen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142801	Thank you for the floor. Today we are dealing with L 160, the draft law amending the law on road transport, the law on bus services and the law on working time for mobile workers in the road transport sector. The aim of the draft law is to implement that part of the EU road package, which sets out changes to the rules on the control of working time for mobile workers carrying out road transport activities, and the rules will improve general road safety, create better and more uniform conditions of competition in Europe and protect drivers in the road transport sector. The draft law introduces as something new a regulatory review of the average and maximum weekly working hours, breaks and night work. This takes the form of an extension of the existing road and business control in the driving-rest-time area, carried out by the police, in the case of roadside checks, and by the works council, in the case of company control. The concrete extension of the control elements of road and company control will promote the objective of improving road safety, protecting drivers' working conditions and preventing distortions of competition, and by means of the legislative proposal we increase the social protection of drivers, while ensuring effective enforcement of the control of working time rules. And these are good measures which the Social Democrats can, of course, support.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142934	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no brief words of thanks to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Left, and that is Mr Seligman. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420142947	Thank you for that, President. The aim of the bill here is, of course, to implement the part of the EU road package which provides that we must strengthen the control of working time for mobile workers carrying out road transport activities. In other words, truck drivers must be able to improve general road safety, create better and more uniform conditions of competition in Europe and protect drivers in the road transport sector, all of which are good objectives. So far, these rules on the Working Time Directive have been dealt with in the spirit of the Danish model by the social partners, but now it is proposed that there should be a regulatory review of the average and maximum weekly working time, breaks, night work etc. In addition, the industry is also regulated in connection with the driving rest time, which is done by means of the tachograph installed in the trucks. The Left supports the overall draft law, but there is no doubt that the draft law goes quite far on some points here, for example. About the levels of fines mentioned. We must always bear in mind that the transport industry is currently suffering from a serious shortage of drivers, not only in Denmark, but actually throughout Europe, and that, like charging too high fines with a very high risk of a driver coming home and telling my grandmother that I have now got a huge fine, and there goes that summer vacation, we do not believe in anything that promotes the recruitment of drivers to an industry that is in need of drivers. So we would have liked to have looked at that part in the committee procedure and if not, as we did with the driving-rest-time rules, we can try to set some fine ceilings that are manageable and reasonable. In the same way, there is confusion in the draft law about when you are actually going to carry out this reinforced control. I mean, it says somewhere, when there's a lot of wrongdoing. What are many transgressions? What exactly is it that someone needs to have broken before doing this extended control? There is therefore a problem with the lack of clarity in the legislative proposal. Then it may well be that in the wake of the bill there will be a guide and circulars etc. from the Minister, and that is what normally happens, but I am most confident that, in the context of the legislative proposal itself, we will decide where the limit for this is and what is actually to be checked. At any rate, this is something that several players in the transport sector have problematized in their consultation responses and therefore also something that we take seriously from the Left. But all in all, it is a bill that we support. However, we need to have looked at the issue of fines and we need to have looked at the definitions about when, including the conditions under which the monitoring of the Working Time Directive is to be carried out. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143306	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment. It's from sir. Henning Hylllested, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143311	Sir. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen believes that the fine level is too high and calls for some kind of fine ceiling. There is, of course, the answer to that in the consultation note, so I would like to hear what the Left's bid is then on the fines to be issued under this law. And where would a possible fine ceiling lie, according to the proposal of the Left?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143344	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143345	Well, we're gonna dive into that. Not long ago, the Left asked for a catalogue from the government of what it is actually for fines a lorry driver is in danger of getting in the course of his work. And it's not small things you're running the risk of. So it is the balance between, on the one hand, we want to crack down on offences because the rules have to be complied with, and, on the other hand, it should not be the case that a driver is anxious to get some huge fines. There must be proportions in things. At the time of the driving-rest-time rules, we introduced a fine of DKK 30,000, and that is probably the level to which it should be added. But we would like to be absolutely sure that this is what the government also thinks, i.e. that we are not just going to let go. Because this issue of fines is something that several people have pointed out in connection with the hearings.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143432	Sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143434	However, the rapporteur of the Left agrees with me that fines are the means of regulating the conditions of road transport. And we're dealing with a business that's very, very creative. So if it is going to be worth something, there must also be fines of a certain amount. The rapporteur also calls for an explanation of the many infringements. I can see that this is also what some of the road haulage organizations are asking about. But what is the Left's view of what are many violations that could then lead to sanctions of one kind or another?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143513	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143514	Well, that's what we're gonna do. In my opinion, the rules have actually worked very well so far, and it is actually my impression that no one is particularly enthusiastic about this tightening up that the European Union is bringing in basically. I have spoken to drivers who say: what is this? We've been doing really well with our employer for years, and we don't drive when we're tired. We're complying with the driving-rest-time rules, and now this is what's stopping me from making some extra money. And that is not exactly what we need in a situation where we need drivers. So that is why we need to look at the things that drivers are actually worried about, and that is what we are delving into in committee. But overall, we support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143555	Then there is one more brief comment. And it's from Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143559	Thank you so much. Thanks for the speech. I did not really intend to ask the rapporteur anything. But then the rapporteur said something that I stumbled over, namely that the Left does not really believe that this, coming from the European Union, is a very good legislative proposal. It is simply too much; it is legislation on top of legislation. Then why is the Left voting in favour?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143621	We do this because the Left is a party that implements the EU legislation that exists. And here the European Union has tightened up the legislation. After all, the government has tried to contact the EU and soften this, but the EU has maintained this, which is why we need to implement it in Danish legislation. But then we should not overimplement! Because that's what happens all the time, and that's why we want to look at these two issues I've mentioned.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143646	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143647	Yes, that is correct; that is what happens often. I am tempted to say that it always happens when EU legislation is implemented that it is overimplemented. I am just really, really wondering why the Left is not setting foot here, because we can clearly see that and the rapporteur himself says that this is a bad bill. So, we are in Denmark, and we are chosen by the Danes to ensure good conditions in Denmark, also for these drivers. And when they also say clearly and clearly that this is a bad legislative proposal, I simply do not understand that the Left can vote in favour.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143720	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143721	Yeah, but it's quite simple. We are part of an association in Europe that guarantees peace, freedom and fair conditions of competition called the European Union, and the Left warmly supports it. When such rules come here that need to be implemented, we always have to look at Denmark not going crazy and implementing it five times harder than other countries. And that's what we're hitting here, and that's what we're looking into. But overall, it is an advantage for Denmark that we have common rules, not least for cross-border transport, because that is what guarantees a level playing field in Europe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143751	Thank you, sir. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen from the Left. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. I am now looking in the Chamber for the SF rapporteur, but I do not see the rapporteur. On the other hand, I can see the rapporteur from the Radical Left, who has the floor. Welcome to sir. Rasmus Helveg Petersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143807	Thank you very much. Thank you for the floor. We can support the bill. We are dealing with a directive implementation which we think is quite sensible. We can support L 160 and we will follow with interest the fine-size debate, which is spoken by the Left. It is therefore quite appropriate to see whether we are hitting it correctly, including in committee. But basically: the Radical Left can support the proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143829	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Enhedslisten he comes along, I can see; it does not need, it is quite all right. Welcome to sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420143851	As has also been said, this is part of the EU road package and the implementation of parts of the EU road package into Danish legislation. As such, it is essential, especially if you are in favour of the union, as the rapporteur of the Left calls it, called the European Union. I have taken note of the fact that road haulage organizations and various employers' organisations have been involved in this, and I would like to say campaign against the bill for a very long time. But it is essential. I also think that this is clearly a necessary follow-up to the implementation of the road package. We have had a few previous legislative proposals that implement other parts of the road package. In addition to ensuring road safety, the aim is first and foremost to create a fair transport market which combats social dumping, which ensures fair and healthy competition, and not to compete on lower pay and working conditions, as has been the case in Europe in cross-border transport. It has also been a mantra over the years that if you were to secure this, there should be effective control. There is something new going on with this bill, so that we move to a regulatory control, where working hours were previously regulated by the social partners through agreements. I am surprised that the draft law still opens up opportunities for the social partners, for example. in relation to the reference period which the two sides of industry have so far operated under the collective agreement provisions of 6 months, which is limited to 4 months, for the calculation of the average weekly working time. Then, after all, we are opening up to the possibility that what is currently contractual may continue to apply, and what is the point of that? In fact, I think that goes back to many places in the bill. Risk-based controls are also carried out. That is all very well, but we can only agree with that, but there must also be the possibility, what should be said, of broader controls, of spot checks, including those of road hauliers who fall out. I refer to the smiley schemes which are in various areas of the food industry, retail goods, etc. etc. Nor can I fully understand why roadside checks, which are, after all, carried out by the police, should concentrate only on breaks, i.e. whether the breaks are being observed. I fully agree that a roadside check may not be able to control the average weekly working time because there is a long reference period on it, but it is possible to check the maximum weekly working time. I think that too much is being done about what can be done by means of roadside checks. I also note that the compensation which employees may receive in the event of dismissal is abolished, for example. if they have their rights violated in connection with an incident under this. It is argued that this is, after all, a double penalty for the employer, and then he does not have to pay compensation. Oh yes, but this is happening in so many other areas where the employer is fined for violating the working environment, and then the employee who has been injured, for example, gets some kind of compensation. Then I can see, and I am really glad that you have kept it a little back and forth, I can see from the various legislative proposals we have had in drafts that there must be an opportunity to withhold vehicles. This has happened since the Ministry of Justice has approached us. I can see in a consultation note from 9 March that it had actually come out, but then it came in on the basis of a request from the Ministry of Justice, and that is very good. I think that is an effective means if the fines are not paid; here we are talking about foreign drivers or hauliers. So it's really good. One must wonder why it has been a little back and forth. Then the possibility of access to companies without a court order has been lifted. We also had that discussion in connection with previous legislative proposals, and here I just think that the Ministry of Transport has laid down flat for road hauliers' organisations which argued against this. I think that when we control social dumping, we must have all the tools at our disposal. So we actually have a number of critical comments on this bill, but overall it is part of the implementation of the road package, and that is why we support the bill in the end.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144404	Thank you, sir. Henning Hylllested. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Conservative People's Party, and that is Mr. Niels Flemming Hansen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144414	Thank you very much for that, President. This is an EU directive which sets the rules for how much people can work per week over a 4- and up to a 6-week period. We are in favour of the proposal, now that the part concerning inspections without a court order has been removed and the reimbursement provisions have been deleted. We are very much looking forward to participating in the committee's proceedings, where we will focus on the fines in particular and perhaps on bringing in a guidance period. After all, this is complicated legislation. Furthermore, we have a concern about the economy in this project. On the other hand, we may think that the money for the Danish Trade Administration is a very low amount • At the same time, we may be concerned that they can handle these controls. And, on the one hand, the concern about the economy may also lie in the fact that the bill describes the possibility of a new IT system, and on the other hand it is that one should be a little bit concerned. We will, of course, follow that up in committee. In general, however, we look forward to the treatment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144526	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Danish People's Party, and that is Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144533	Thank you, President. The Danish People's Party is in favour of proper conditions for drivers and of fair competition for transport companies. In this respect, the EU's internal market has not helped Danish companies. The many cases of underpaid labour and gross exploitation of foreign workers' labour have made it difficult to operate transport operations. That is why we also welcome the fact that something is finally being done to stem the abuse. We are therefore in favour of more control, so that the working time rules are respected by everyone. On the other hand, we are sorry that the draft law interferes with the Danish labour market model. The social partners, as others have said, have already agreed to agree, among other things. These things, and although they do not cover all matters as in the Road Packages Directive, it is always better for the social partners to find out. After all, the bill will put these agreements out of effect. We note that there is criticism of this very fact in the hearings and we agree with the criticism. Isolatedly, it might be possible to live with it, but unfortunately we see that the Danish model is coming more and more under pressure because of our membership of the European Union. If this development continues, there will be nothing left of our Danish model in the future. Therefore, as things stand right now, we will probably end up voting yellow at the third reading. We are in favour of monitoring, so that companies comply with the rules on working time in the interests of drivers. However, we are opposed to the draft law interfering in labour market agreements at the same time. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144732	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to the rapporteur, and that is from Mr Seligman. Henning Hylllested, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144737	Perhaps that is most of a comment, because the draft law here is, first and foremost, a legislative proposal aimed at monitoring the implementation that is to take place. And it is true, as I myself pointed out in my rapporteur's speech, that there is now a transition to regulatory control. In the past it was the social partners themselves. We just have to note that I think we can at least see that the social partners have not had one in the past, not just in this area, what to say, lucky hand or been effective in the control of working time. That is also why control of, for example, has been left behind. drive-rest-time to the authorities. It would be a completely impossible task for companies and for the social partners in general and for the trade unions to control. The same can be said of cabotage. It has been shown that it has not been possible for the trade unions to maintain the restrictions on cabotage which, after all, have been. So I think it should be in this pool.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144841	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144842	There are two levels. There is the more practical level, that is, how we ensure that companies comply with the rules on working time, and then there is the more fundamental level of EU eating into the Danish labour market model day after day. It's the salami method, it's slice by slice. That is why we have little difficulty in voting in favour, although we are well aware that there must also be regulatory control, as Mr. Henning Hyllested tells me so well. We are really concerned about the EU's threat to the Danish labour market model, which we see time and time again not only here but also in other areas of concern.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144922	Sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420144923	I fully share that concern. We can see it now with the EC's, no EU's, there can only be seen very far-reaching steps towards the introduction of a European minimum wage. It will really be an undermining of the Danish labour market model. I fully agree with that and it cannot be fought hard enough in our opinion. After all, I think this bill is an improvement on what we have known, and that is why it is also supported by the social partners at least and perhaps more by the trade unions than by the employers' organisations, I think I can see from the consultation answers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145006	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145007	Yeah, I guess we're a little more worried than the Enhedslisten. After all, the Ministry of Transport admits in the comments that it is I think it is sad, and I hope that the Danes will find out at some point.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145030	Thank you, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen and Dansk Folkeparti. We move forward in the rapporteur's line and the next rapporteur comes from New Citizens, and that is Mrs Mette Thiesen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145049	This is, as several of the previous rapporteurs on the platform have said, the implementation of an EU directive in an area that is already heavily regulated, namely this area of driving rest time, etc. I simply cannot understand it, because when you read the consultation answers from among others. ITD, which specifically advises against and in fact strongly warns against the adoption of the bill in its current form, then I think it should call for a little bit of due diligence. I know that some changes have been made, and it is of course positive that changes have been made in relation to others. You know, this whole thing about being able to go in without a warrant. I think that is a good thing. However, it is still a legislative proposal which builds legislation on top of legislation, in other words regulates an area which is already very much regulated. In New Citizens, we see no reason to introduce legislation, overimplement legislation, just because some people in the European Union are saying that we should do it. It must make sense for Denmark and for the Danes, which is why we cannot support the draft law as it currently stands.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145202	Thank you to Mrs Mette Thiesen. There is a desire for labelling, and it is from Mr. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145208	Thank you. I would just like to welcome what the rapporteur says: New citizens will not be involved in over-implementation, because it is junk, so we must avoid that. That is why I should like to ask whether New Citizens welcome the fact that, in the course of the committee's proceedings, we are asking a number of questions based on:
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145234	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145235	We are so committed to the removal of some of the thistles contained in this bill. After all, we saw that it was simply shot at the corner because what the rapporteur quite rightly says is an over-implementation, but it is also an implementation of something that we simply do not think is necessary at this stage, at least not in this reform.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145254	Thank you to the rapporteur of the new citizens. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Free Greens, and that is Mrs Susanne Zimmer. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145310	I would just like to say very briefly that we support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145319	Thank you to the Free Greens and there were no brief comments to the rapporteur. Then I do not see that there are any more rapporteurs who have asked to speak, and I can give the floor to the Minister for Transport.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145330	I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the comments on the draft law on the control of working time and also for the questions that have been asked. With its cross-border nature, the EU road transport sector has experienced unfair competition and poor working conditions for too many years. The need for clear rules not only improves, but ensures that we owe it to us to protect the many drivers who carry out an important social task every day and who are of great importance for the supply of goods to and from Denmark and around Denmark. And we owe it to companies that comply with the rules a fair basis to compete on. With the road package, we have strengthened the establishment requirements for companies. We have had clear rules on posting and driving-rest time, and now we have clear rules on how to enforce the control of working time. The aim of the bill is to implement the rules of the road package on the control of working time in Danish law, which is an important complement to the other parts of the EU road package that have entered into force. The draft law introduces as something new a regulatory control as an extension of existing road and business control in the driving-rest-time area. With the new controls, both road safety and the protection of drivers' working conditions will be improved, while at the same time eliminating the distortions of competition that we have seen taking place in the Danish road transport industry. The Ministry of Transport, together with the social partners, has had a long process of how these controls could fit into the Danish labour market model. Many models have been at play in this respect, but a model based on regulatory control is ultimately considered to be the most viable if the model is to comply with the regulations of the road package. Once again, I would like to thank you for your comments. I look forward to further consideration here in the Folketing and, of course, I am available to answer any questions that may be asked. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145550	I would like to thank the Minister, and here in the Chamber there is a request for a brief comment to be made to Mr Seligman. Henning Hylllested, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145555	First of all, I would like the Minister to try to comment on the comments that have been made, particularly by the citizens, that this is an over-implementation, and I might as well have said that, for example, we should have done so. in the context of a previous draft law on the wage requirement for third country driving, a clearly unsatisfactory underimplementation was achieved. But what I really want to ask is in relation to the control which then has to take place, so why the Ministry of Transport has gone away from being able to go to a company without a court order. I know that we had the discussion in connection with an earlier draft law, but I still think that it should have been included, and it might well have been that a majority had once again been opposed. But then we know who it is that will have some effective means in the fight against social dumping, and I think that would be very nice to have exhibited. And so is the compensation for drivers. Why is it gone? Why are roadside checks only reserved for breaks? In fact, I do not think that is necessary and I do not think that the argument in the consultation note is sufficient. And why, if I may say so, has the retention of vehicles gone back and forth so far?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145711	Thank you. Now the President has stood up for a relatively long time, so that means that speaking time is far exceeded. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145716	Thank you. I think it's really important that we follow this area closely. We share a common desire to cut the stumps and the stumps are important, but it is also important to involve us in implementing the legislation, and there it has been important for the Ministry of Transport, with close involvement of both DA and FH, precisely to ensure this balance, and that we put it in line with the corner where the social partners have played a central role, and that is also why controls must be carried out as an extension of existing road and business controls in the driving-rest-time area. Of course, you might want even more, but what's been the assessment of this is that there's a really good cut.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145817	Sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145819	Yes, but I just note that I think there is a difference between this bill and what we have also dealt with in the past with the implementation of parts of the road package on third-country driving, where, after all, we strongly criticised the fact that there was no wage requirement for third-country driving. In other words, no account was taken of 3F's very strong objections to the version of implementation that was made there. I think that there has been a great deal of consideration here for employers' requests, both from the DA and also from the many road haulage organizations. I really think that, as I said in my rapporteur's speech, a little flat has been laid down, at least on some points, in relation to the representations that have been made or the campaign that has been carried out by the employers' organisations, and I do not fully understand why there should be that difference. I think the trade union movement is a little scalded here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145904	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145906	I think we have landed in a very good place, and I also think it makes sense that we follow the area closely, that we see how this legislation works. However, I also think that the debate here today clearly shows that there are many different perspectives on this, and what should certainly not be in doubt is that where the Danish Government stands there is a place where we have a clear desire to implement the European Union's road package. We believe that it is the strongest tool in terms of getting rid of this across borders. We also believe that the proposal that is on the table here will help to support those who have fair working conditions and make life harder and harder for those who do not understand how to treat their employees.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420145953	Thanks to the Minister for Transport. Then there are no further brief comments to the Minister. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Transport Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420150009	I would point out that the actual vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until Thursday 21 April 2022. Before opening the debate, the rapporteurs must be allowed to sit here in the inner circle with the aim of having an exciting and lively debate, and that is not because it cannot also take place when you sit in the other seats. However, we have gathered here for a different form of debate and the President thinks it is a pleasure when Members are close. Then I shall begin by giving the floor to the author of the question, Mrs Susanne Zimmer, to explain this question. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420150126	I've been looking forward to this debate. We destroy our home, Amazon's trap, our garden is contaminated with poison and plastic. Oil spills destroy the basis of life for thousands of people and animals. It's obvious that we don't take good care of our planet and the life that lives on it. Fortunately, most of us have realized this. That is why we are talking much more about climate and biodiversity than we have ever done before. But international law has not followed either globally or in relation to science or the values that we all value so highly. There are gaps in the legislation, and we need to patch them up, and the addition of eco-murders is one way of patching up those gaps. Ecomords or in English ecocids literally cover up what we do when we destroy our homes or the homes of others, you could also say nature murder, and an addition of ecomords is, as I said, a way of patching up some of the gaps in international law. It has a wide range of activists from around the world fought for for many years. There are a large number of countries that have had eco-murders in turn in their national parliaments, the UN Secretary-General openly supports the fight for eco-murder to be made a crime as part of the Rome Statute, and so do activists all over the world. The international campaign to end eco-murders is taking off around us. What do we want here in Denmark? We in the Free Greens think it is appropriate and quite natural for us in Denmark to support the fight to criminalise eco-mortality on an equal footing with, for example, the United Kingdom. genocide and war crimes before the International Criminal Court. It can be done in several different ways. Belgium, for example, adopted: in December last year a resolution which instructed the Belgian Government to work to create an alliance of pioneering states, which they call "willing states'. It is an alliance that must actively take the lead and pave the way for criminalising eco-murders, and it is an alliance that we naturally hope that Denmark too will join, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and look forward to the debate. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420150340	Thank you to Mrs Susanne Zimmer for justifying this question. I can give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to reply. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420150352	Thank you for that, thank you to Mrs Susanne Zimmer and Mr. Sikandar Siddique for today's inquiry debate. The questioners refer to ecological crises and natural and climate degradation, and I look forward to the discussion and debate we are going to have in this Chamber today. First of all, I would like to emphasise the government's absolute support for the International Criminal Court. Punishment of the most serious international crimes must and must be combated. We are talking here about attacks on innocent civilians, about extermination, murder, torture, sexual violence, slavery, crimes against innocent civilians that can hardly be imagined. In other words, the brutality of war. This is, in a tragic way, still something that we see today, particularly now here in Europe, in Ukraine. No one can doubt that we need a resourceful and effective court. Denmark has just referred the situation in Ukraine to the court, where the chief prosecutor is now conducting his investigation, and I am proud of the inflexible support that Denmark has shown to the court since its establishment in 1998 and we must continue to support the court both in word and in action. This includes, among other things: ensuring that the Court's mandate and tasks match its capacity and expertise. The Government has therefore also chosen to make an exceptional financial contribution to the Court upon request to all States Parties following the reference to the situation in Ukraine. Only last week I made it clear directly to the ICC, the Chief Prosecutor of the Court, Karim Khan, that Denmark is fully behind him and the court as a whole. That brings me to the question put by the questioner about adding eco-morder to the Statute of the Court of Justice. The government has a clear priority to raise global ambitions for climate, environment and nature. This requires cross-cutting sustainability thinking, which is also reflected in the UN's global goals in the work of protecting the environment and nature. We must not forget this, even in the light of other crises that we see. That is why I am also pleased that the questioners are focusing on the major challenges we face. Thank you. This year it is 50 years since the first global UN Environment Conference was held in Stockholm, and it was also here that it was decided to set up the UN Environment Programme, and over the years Denmark has fought to strengthen environmental and nature protection at global level. Through Danish development aid we support a raised level of environmental protection in developing countries, we establish sustainable water recovery, chemical and waste management, climate adaptation in direct cooperation with and in the countries and through the UN and other multilateral partners. We are also fighting for ambitious EU regulation to enhance environmental protection here in Europe, and we can be proud that European and Danish solutions have often been involved and are inspirational to the rest of the world, and together we are raising the level of ambition. The government wants Denmark to be a green pioneer in the global climate and environmental efforts in the future too, so that we can inspire and influence the rest of the world. In order to achieve effect and results, efforts to protect the environment must be focused and appropriate, and innovation is therefore also a sign of the idea of criminalising what is called eco-mortage. This is an interesting idea that the government is following and discussing with interest. The idea is still at an early stage and there are a number of unresolved issues. In particular, it is unclear in which specific cases the court would be able to punish individuals for eco-mortage if it became crime in the Rome Statute, and for reasons of legal certainty it is essential that new penal provisions have a clear content of crime and, according to the information provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no country has yet criminalised eco-mortality at national level, and there is therefore no case law, no widely accepted international definition of the crime content here. In contrast, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes were well-established and well-defined crimes in both national and international courts before they were added to the Statute. It was also based on international practice, and the government believes that a solid legal basis is important before decisions are taken to add new crimes to the jurisdiction of the court. Clarity and early recognition of practice here are very key elements • elements that so far lack when it comes to what is called ecomord. The need for a solid legal basis is probably also the reason why few changes have been made to the Rome Statute since its adoption back in 1998. We have not yet seen that other completely new categories of crime have been added despite several proposals on this, for example. on terrorism and nuclear weapons, because it requires clarity and it requires established practice. The Court of Justice investigates the most serious violations of international law, often in countries where there is conflict. This requires great investigative capacity and a massive need for resources. Right now, 17 active cases are under way in countries such as Sudan, Libya and Mali, the oldest of the investigations have started back in 2004, and we regret to note that a number of investigations have not yet produced any significant results. The ICC, that is to say the court, has a very extensive task in ensuring investigation and conviction in the already existing crimes under the ICC's jurisdiction, crimes which, unfortunately, we still see committed to far too great an extent right now in Ukraine. The government's focus is just to ensure that the ICC has the resources, legal expertise and the relevant support to be able to prosecute the existing crimes. That is why the government is fundamentally reluctant to add completely new types of crime to the Rome Statute, and I would also like to mention that the idea has already been discussed with like-minded countries which, like Denmark, are reluctant to take that step in this forum at this time. However, the government will not deny that in time it may become relevant to reconsider which crimes the court should have jurisdiction over. Therefore, the government continues to follow discussions on the criminalisation of ecomords in relevant international forums with great interest. Finally, I would also like to stress once again the importance that the government attaches to the International Criminal Court, the ICC, that is more important than ever before, and we must stand together to combat impunity for the most serious crimes. The Government therefore considers that the time has not come to impose further tasks on the court. I thank you and look forward to a good debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151147	Thank you to the Secretary of State. It is now the case that there is one short comment from the rapporteurs here in the first round. Mrs Susanne Zimmer, the Green Group in the European Parliament, wishes to take advantage of this. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151158	Thank you. Thank you, Minister, for recognising, however, that we have a problem. After all, the government prides itself on being a green forerunner, and it would be really nice if we were. It is clear that if we are to set something new in motion, which the Minister is also suggesting that we really need to deal with these major natural disasters, then we are starting with a lack of clarity. Then the Minister will address and support the need for clarity so that you can find out how to actually do it and get it into the Rome Statute on an equal footing with that of Belgium and Iceland, for example. Haven't done it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151236	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151237	To Mrs Susanne Zimmer, I would like to say that, firstly, this government has a clear wish that Denmark is a green forerunner of the fight for climate, environment and nature in the world, and so do we. Secondly, we, together with like-minded countries, also affect that agenda. Thirdly, as I said, we consider the debate on eco-morder and that discussion to be important. What is crucial to the fact that it is precisely the criminal court that is to be used as a tool is that there is a basis for it. I am not going to repeat all the arguments, and I do not have time for that either, but we risk weakening a court, and we are also in danger of doing something that is not the case law for, even in any country that is a partner of the court. That is why it is very important for us to think very carefully, and that is why I think the debate is important. However, as I mentioned, we believe that the Court of Justice, with what is at stake and the cases that are running, needs support and focus. And that does not mean that we do not agree that ecomord and climate, environmental and nature debate are important.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151341	The next brief remark is to Mr. Rasmus Nordqvist, Socialist People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151343	Thank you. And I would like to thank the Minister for an in-depth and nuanced speech, and I also share some of the concerns expressed in terms of capacity. The Minister said that there is an ongoing discussion with like-minded countries or other countries concerned with these issues. Can the Minister tell us whether there are any other ways of raising this problem, just as we have started a domestic review of our legislation in this area in order to look at animal crime and so on?? Are there discussions in other forums where you could raise this debate, which I also think is very important, about what it really is that we are going after those who commit crime in this way against our environment, our planet and our climate?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151438	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151439	Thank you, sir. Rasmus Nordqvist. I would just like to say at the outset that I fully agree that the approach to this is that it is important that, with the objectives of the world, we have a debate which takes into account all parts of this issue. I am simply not convinced either of the capacity in the criminal court that it is the right thing to do, that is to add this crime, which is not clear, and where it would be difficult to reach a situation at all where a conviction can be made. On the contrary, I believe that it would be very important for us to strengthen cooperation within the European Union on these issues. I know that this is something that we are debating, among other things. in the European Parliament; I myself have been involved in this. But also nationally in relation to countries that are particularly affected by ecological disasters, natural changes, climate change and impacts, I think it is really important to look at this. Denmark would like to support this. With like-minded countries, we would like to contribute to discussing how we can strengthen the defence of nature's right to the destruction that I agree with far too freely can be done by people who do not respect nature, the environment and the climate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151543	The next brief remark is to Mr. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151544	Thank you, and thank you, Minister, for your statement. I would just like to say that, given that it takes up so much that the International Criminal Court does not have the capacity to take this area in too, and when it is argued that they are already far behind, what does the Minister think can be done to make them up to date and perhaps to follow a little better with the terrible war crimes that are happening? I think that we will have a series of things to decide on when the necessary evidence is likely to be collected in Ukraine. However, it is important that such a court has a capacity, both to be an authority, but also to have the support that is necessary for people to say that it is serious to come before the International Criminal Court. We've heard despots say, we'll just stay at home with ourselves. That is why I believe that we must find that money internationally.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151647	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151648	I fully share the view that Mr. Christian Juhl here says how important the court is. After all, Denmark has also taken the lead and, as I said in my remarks, has allocated money specifically to the investigation of the terrible crimes that we see being committed in Ukraine while we are speaking in this Chamber, because of the Russian invasion, which is contrary to all international law and law. It is important that we can do this. And I hope that other countries will follow Denmark's example. I myself had the opportunity last week, when I was in Luxembourg, to discuss some of these issues with the Chief Prosecutor of the Court and to express Danish support for it, too, to put pressure on like-minded EU countries, so that you can also contribute financially to the court. So we are at the forefront of that struggle, including the ratifications of the Rome Statute. One of the things that is important to us is that we are constantly getting more and more countries to join in being state parties in the court. This is important for the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Court globally.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151744	Thank you to the Secretary of State. There are no more brief comments. And that means that we are now moving on to the more general debate and therefore also to the general rules for short remarks. The first to speak is the rapporteur for the questioners, and that is Mrs Susanne Zimmer from the Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420151806	Thank you to the Minister for the speech. I have to say that it is not enough to recognise that we have a problem; we also have to do something about it. And yes, it costs some money, just as we have found money for the International Criminal Court in the past. In other words, we now have oil spills off Peru's coast, which smash the marine environment and pull away the basis of life under the animals and people who depend on healthy balances in the environment. The Amazon is being cleared with the speed of light, which destroys the livelihoods of animals and humans, and at the same time you fire up during the climate crisis. Rivers are polluted by large mining companies when they extract coal and minerals in South Africa and Mozambique; this makes the areas uninhabitable to humans and pollutes nature. The problem is that nobody is being held responsible for these damage, and our legislation is obviously too weak to prevent it from happening, because that would be the very best thing. It can be said that this is actually what this is all about, in other words preventing these disasters from happening. An addition of ecocide or ecomord as a crime under the International Criminal Court is one of the ways in which that challenge can be met. We need new thinking when it comes to environmental protection. A criminalization of ecocide is one way to do it. This would mean that those responsible in a company could be prosecuted and not just get away with fines or bribes from a prosecution in states that have fragile legal systems; it could also mean prison sentences. Ecocide intends to act as a deterrent to those responsible, for example. The oil companies think twice before they make their decisions. Both the UN Secretary-General and Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, support this. Ecocide is one way to make it clear that we need to also reduce the protection of our climate and the environment and the people who live on the planet. Our existence is at stake. It requires new ways of thinking and new ways of adapting our legislation. This requires us to take harder action against those who are tearing away the basis of life from us or from the weak sections of the population. That is why we in the Free Greens believe that it is quite obvious to work to criminalise the ecocide and that it is reflected in international law. In other words, we are pleased that the Minister immediately supports this, but we have to take the lead and, like other progressive countries, go along with it in order to help get this going so that it does not just go through good declarations of intent. In the resolution adopted in the Belgian Parliament last December, they are based on the international treaty between the proactive countries. You propose an amendment to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in The Hague as the second thing. And as the third thing they are proposing a report to show how to integrate the ecocide into the Belgian penal code. In the light of this, the Greens will make the following points: Proposals for adoption The Danish Parliament notes that it is necessary to ensure better prevention of natural, environmental and climate damage than current legislation permits. The Folketing therefore urges the government to actively support Vanuatu and the Maldives' initiative to add ecocide to the Rome Statute as the fifth crime to be prosecuted on the basis of, under the auspices of the International Criminal Court, searching for diplomatic opportunities which can substantially contribute to this. The government is required to take the initiative and actively participate in a group of eligible states to prepare policy proposals and take the lead in the work to add to the Rome Statute and thus be included in international law. In addition, the government is actively required to work to ensure that ecocide is also reflected in EU legislation through relevant EU fora. • V 69).
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152240	Thank you for the proposals for the adoption text, which will be included in the further negotiations, and so thank you to the rapporteur. There is no wish for short remarks to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Social Democratic Party, and that is Mrs Annette Lind.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152258	Thank you for that, President. I want to be honest with you. In fact, I never went to the Chamber after reading the title of a case down here without knowing what it was that I was going to talk about. I didn't do that today. I have simply never heard of eco-murders, but nevertheless I have come to the point, so it was certainly good for my own attention. First of all, I would like to thank the Free Greens for raising an interesting and also important debate. History, as we all know, unfortunately offers many horrible examples of innocent people being subjected to the atrocities of the world without the perpetrator having subsequently been placed under legal responsibility. Fortunately, it was actually a milestone when, in 1998, 120 countries brought me together to uphold the International Criminal Court. The Court of Justice is precisely a tool designed to ensure the prosecution of persons who have committed some of the worst acts we can imagine: war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity. Unfortunately, such crimes against humanity are not something that belongs only to the past or to distant continents, because right now we are witnessing Putin's horrific brutal attack on innocent civilians in Ukraine. We have probably all seen the horrible pictures from Butja in particular, but also now Donbas, and of course from the Danish side we have raised these terrible events for the ICC, where they are now also being investigated. In other words, the work of the ICC to combat impunity for the most serious crimes in the world may be more important to us now than ever before. For us in the Social Democratic Party, it is therefore vital that the Court can work purposefully and effectively. The ICC should focus all its energy and capacity on investigating and prosecuting the crimes against humanity that have already been criminalised in the Rome Statute, which in itself is a comprehensive and demanding task, which unfortunately does not always succeed. We must therefore think very carefully before we begin to impose additional tasks on the ICC in the current situation. As the Foreign Minister has just said, there are also some legal reservations about adding ecomord to the Rome Statute. No country has yet criminalised eco-murders, and that is why there is no case law now in this area. There is no official international definition, and we think that there is a lack of it, and hence no clearly defined crime content, which is problematic in terms of legal certainty. In short, there are quite a few unresolved issues in terms of securing a legal foundation. Having said that, Denmark must of course take the lead in the green struggle to protect the climate, the environment and nature in all international forums where Denmark already plays a key role in raising global ambitions. Fortunately, there are plenty of useful tools in the toolbox and many good ideas on the table, which is why we must also continue to follow and participate in the international discussions on whether and how it is possible to criminalise the worst attacks on our common nature and planet. Then it is the case that the Radical Left cannot be present, so I should like to welcome the rapporteur and say that she also supports the text of the adoption, which I would just like to read out. The adoption text here has a broad consensus from Enhedslisten, SF, Social Democrats, Radical Left, Left and Conservative People's Party, and the adoption text reads as follows: Proposal for adoption The Danish Parliament declares its continued support for the International Criminal Court and the work to eliminate impunity for the most serious international crimes. The Danish Parliament stresses the need for Denmark to contribute to raising global ambitions for climate, environment and nature. The Danish Parliament also recognises the need for new thinking in the protection of the environment and calls on the Government to take part in discussions on the criminalisation of ecomords (ecocide) in relevant international fora. At the same time, the Folketing considers it essential for confidence in the institutions of international law that matters defined as international crimes can actually be effectively sanctioned and lead to conviction. The Danish Parliament also recognises that the International Criminal Court has limited capacity and already has a significant task in investigating and prosecuting war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, which have already been criminalised in the Statute of the International Criminal Court. • V 68).
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152743	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. The text of the adoption will be included in the further negotiations. Then there are a few brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. It's first, sir. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152752	Thank you. Now I hear that the Minister reads that statement in a way and that I read it with a slightly different eye. But let it go. We shall come back to that when I take the floor. I would like to ask the Socialist rapporteur whether we are not supposed to have a court of law. Because I believe that today there are two crucial threats for humanity. One is that the nuclear weapons and ugly weapons that are on this planet are being used, and we feel blown in the neck at the moment. The second is the climate crisis. It's existential. It can exterminate humanity. That is why we need to act much more internationally. How do the Socialists think we should get on with this, other than saying that we should keep an eye on it? We have to form a place where we can tell the people who are so busy profiting from nature and the climate that we can't; that's where we stop, and there's a limit, and you're being punished if you don't comply with these rules.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152854	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152855	Thank you for the question and also thank you to Enhedslisten for supporting the adoption text on which we broadly agree in the Folketing. I think that is really important. The first is, of course, and we discuss it a lot in many contexts... that this needs to be defined. You have to define what it is that needs to be punished for. Right now it's symbol politics, as it's written in this query debate. We need to define a lot. As long as such things as the use of nuclear weapons and terrorism have not yet been written into the Rome Statute, we will have to define it before we can put it on as criminalisation and prosecution. But we are working towards it, which is why we are on our way. But first, it needs to be properly defined.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152949	Sir. Christian Juhl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420152950	I do not think this question is particularly abstract for the archipelagos that are losing their country because these islands are disappearing, or for the indigenous peoples of Brazil's rain forests, who can see that their livelihoods are completely disappearing. Some of them even die in the fight against these big companies that just want to profit from the values of the rain forest. I think this is practical existential reality for these people, and that is why we need to act. We cannot say that we have to wait until terror comes on at the criminal court. We need to act and walk on two legs so that both the climate disaster and the war disaster are prevented.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153033	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153035	I fully agree with the questioner that anyone with the naked eye can see that our seas are being polluted and that our rain forests are being cut down without anything new being set up. But at the same time, this statute is simply so demanding in relation to things that things must therefore be properly defined. No country has yet done so. No country has criminalized this at all yet. That is why our first objective is to talk to the other countries about how the definition should be, because without a definition one cannot put it on a statute of Rome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153111	The next brief remark is from Mrs Susanne Zimmer, the Free Greens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153112	Thank you and thank the rapporteur for seeing this as something serious. I'd like to follow up on sir. Christian Juhl's statements, because what is happening in Ukraine right now is absolutely terrible. No one disagrees about that. But what is happening in relation to our climate and our environment and our nature now is just as terrible for our children and grandchildren and the next generations because we are in the process of breaking it down. That is why something has to happen, and that is why it is important to hold some people personally responsible for it, because otherwise it will be such a diffuse thing with legal proceedings that are being conducted and not implemented. So what exactly do the government and the rapporteur think they will do to ensure that this is not just a matter of observing what is happening and what others are taking the initiative to do? What is it that the government has to take the initiative on in concrete terms?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153210	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153211	We all know and we have many discussions in this Chamber about Putin's war in Ukraine that it is absolutely terrible. That is why we, the government and the Social Democrats, are making a great many moves. Yesterday we presented Denmark can more II... and we have made a green tax reform. We must combat dependence on Putin's gas, we must make much more green. But about this, it was said before that you should not just make declarations of intent. If we are not just to make declarations of intent and make policy on symbols, we must go all the way down to defining it. And as long as it is not defined, we cannot put it on as a war crime or a crime in itself. That is why we need to discuss with all the other countries, and I think that is what we want to do in the text of the adoption. We are going to work towards having this, but if it is only written in this way and not discussed, you cannot put it into the Rome Statute, and then you cannot get it for the criminal court either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153319	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153320	I would like to say that I am in fact one hundred per cent in agreement with the rapporteur. That is precisely what needs to be defined. But it has to happen. It is not enough simply to talk about it, what is the rapporteur thinking that will happen next month or next year to get this going? Because we just need it to get started.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153341	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153342	This is how the rapporteur himself said that we are busy now in relation to the work on war crimes. After all, we in Denmark are taking the lead in having to investigate, for example. the war crimes that have taken place in Butja. There's gotta be time for this. There must be talks between countries. Denmark is not the first to say that we should have this approved, but we are working towards a common definition. That is why the Foreign Ministers must talk, the prime ministers must talk, the climate ministers must talk. If this is the case as a statute, it must be well and thoroughly defined. And now I've said it a hundred times, but that's what it takes. There is a need for dialogue and definitions, because right now it is symbolic policy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153430	Thank you to Mrs Annette Lind, the Social Democratic Party. The next rapporteur comes from the Left, and that is Mr. Kim Valentin. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153454	Thank you to the rapporteur for addressing this issue. First of all, I would like to make a small personal observation, because I simply think that the word eco-morder is small in scope for what it really covers. In fact, I think the English concept is better. Ecocide seems to me much better at covering up what we are actually talking about here. If you look at this historically, there are many examples of countries, businesses and people doing something that has really meant something to the earth's environment and climate in a negative way. We have seen disaster with oil and we have seen disaster with chemicals. We have seen plenty of disasters around Europe and the world, historically speaking. What has sometimes been difficult is to bring those concerned to justice. So the problem is real. It can then be said that national legislation very much covers some of these issues. They do, and they have to. But it is not everywhere in the world that they are comprehensive. So the question is whether we have a good enough coverage of it. I have to say that if we look at the European Union, we have actually, within all the countries of the European Union, had a focus on how to better ensure consumers, ensure standards and ensure follow-up on these parts. So there has actually been a very, very great development in Europe and in the world in relation to this issue, but it is still not good enough. I'm still staying away from the historical description. We in the Left are therefore of the opinion that international cooperation is extremely important. Getting an international view of this issue is super important. Getting to an effective treatment of this is also super important. But is it jumping straight into the fact that the international court has to deal with this? We're not sure about that. In any case, it must be properly examined. This is one of the things we need to be really, really good at investigating. And it is not only Denmark that has to do it; there are many other countries that have to do it at the same time. In fact, the fact that we are talking and doing this in a proper way also ensures that we can help those affected by the island states or small communities around which their livelihoods are threatened effectively, rather than just saying that now the international court has to deal with yet another matter, that now the international court has to deal with another area. They don't even have specialists for it, but of course you can. But such things have to be properly investigated before you jump into it. And then there is the risk of watering down the good and strong work they are doing in relation to war crimes, crimes against humanity and everything they are doing today, which they are actually doing amazingly well and have been doing since 1998. So, although it is a good problem to address, we believe that we should not push for the International Criminal Court to do something they may not be ready to deal with at all. Having said that, it is also important for us in the Left that we find solutions to this. Some solutions need to be found to this, and I would therefore also like to acknowledge that the rapporteur has raised the issue in the question. That is why it is not enough just to sit back and say that we have said it. Well, now something has to be done; a process has to be started around these parts. Because it has great consequences for all of us when things like this happen. It is our common planet that is at stake, and it is to a large extent these local populations, but it is also the world population. And nature actually suffers serious damage in many places. So it has to be said from the Left that we take this really, really seriously. This must be done in a proper way, and that is why we also support the text of the Social Democrat Party on ecocide.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420153956	There are a few brief comments to be made to the rapporteur, and that is only from Mr Seligman's point of view. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154000	I would really like the old large parties not only to say that it is problematic if we destroy the Criminal Court and so on and that we have to think very carefully. Can't you hear that it actually sounds like you're saying: Well, I'd rather go much slower, maybe even go a little backwards? I'll tell you what. Point 1: It's a serious problem, it's even an existential threat we have on this globe. Paragraph 2: We must all make an effort. Paragraph 3: We need to spend all our time with the others when discussing this subject, to find concrete solutions, perhaps even to set up a think tank in Denmark or in Europe or in the Nordic countries or wherever it is. So we have known, yes, since 2015, we have at least agreed that this is an existential threat to humanity. That's why we've had a little time to think about it. So I think it is time that the big parties too began to lift up and say: we must now find the ideas needed to move forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154108	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154109	I respect the line, but I just have to turn it around and say, 'It's you, the questioners, who have to think extra carefully.' You're the ones who have to think about it. What are you trying to force through with this? It has to be done properly. That is what is important. It should not be such a half-finished solution to something very important that is a major problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154142	Just a small deposit about it using direct indictment: you and you are also directly indictment, just in the plural. It's not gonna work. But so many wise things were said that I didn't want to interrupt anyone. Sir. Christian Juhl for his second brief remark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154155	I can tell you about myself, I remember. First of all, I cannot take credit for this proposal. Others have the right to take it. But I can say to the rapporteur of the Left that it is not they who are the messengers who must be reproached and extra duties imposed. They are also the ones who sit on their chairs and say that we have to think a lot about who has a duty to do so. It is the Left, the Social Democratic Party, the Conservative and Radical Left, and you can mention all the parties involved and also bring the Non-attached Members. We all have a collective responsibility to think faster and act faster than we do at the moment. Otherwise we won't make it. That is what is wrong, and that is why the rapporteur also has a cursed responsibility, which I hope is not to curse, but a very, very great responsibility.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154243	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154244	I thought it was swearing. In fact, I could repeat my speech, because what I am saying is that the problem is a real problem. I say we have to do something about it, but we have to do it properly instead of just jumping into a solution that doesn't solve anything. And then I have to apologise to the rapporteur for the Free Greens and say that it is, of course, the Free Greens who bring that question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154313	I can give the floor to the Greens. Mrs Susanne Zimmer for a brief comment. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154317	Thank you to the rapporteur. I would like to say that, although I do not think it is an ambitious text for adoption, I am very pleased that we have had the debate today, when some people have talked about something that others did not know about in advance, and that we do have a text for adoption that moves it in the right direction. Of course, in the Free Greens, we did not imagine that we could go out and have this implemented in the Rome Statute next year, because there is an organisation that has been working on this for 50 years, so there is something to build on. The question is, then, what is to happen now, because this paper is not finished; it is a proposal for something to be done and for some initiatives to be taken in order to cooperate with those countries that have actually started working on this at international level.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154411	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154412	In other words, I do not disagree with what has been said, but it was also more of a comment as I hear it. I also hear that the rapporteur recognises the rapporteur's speech and that it shows the right direction. Therefore, allow me to draw that conclusion, but otherwise I will probably hear something in a moment that we are in agreement with the idea that it should be a proper solution to this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154440	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154440-2	We fully agree with that. The only question is, when is it gonna happen? So I ask the rapporteur something: if we took this up again in one year's time, what does the rapporteur think will have happened in the year that has elapsed? Is there any action that makes us approach and can get it into the Rome Statute, or is there another solution that is just as good?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154503	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154505	I hope that we have come closer to a proper solution to a problem. And it's not just to say a few words here. But that is also in the text of the Socialists, it is in that text, and that is why we agree with the text which the rapporteur Annette Lind read before. That is what is important to us, namely that we recognise the problem, that we can see the problem and then find a proper solution to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154538	Thank you, sir. Kim Valentin from the Left. There will then be no further brief comments to the rapporteur of the Left, and I can give the floor to the next rapporteur, and that is the rapporteur of the Socialist People's Party, and that is Mr Beazley. Rasmus Nordqvist. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420154554	One can say that fortunately we are discussing the ecocide today, and it is a discussion that has been going on for a very long time, and it is nothing new that we are discussing what we really are reacting to the destruction of the planet on which we live. The rapporteur for the questioners said in his introduction that this was about our home, and I would really like to question it, because I think we are here more like some who, as a cousin, should look after the globe for all those who do not have a vote for nature, for animals, for plants, but also for future generations, than that it is ours. We're here to take care of it and to pass the planet on to others. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a planet on which man's prints can be seen for the first time. We see a sixth mass extermination, etc. etc. The alarm should be clear to everyone. What is happening right now, both in relation to the climate mentioned by the Enhedslisten's rapporteur, but also in relation to the environmental pollution that is happening, and in relation to the destruction of biodiversity on the planet that is happening, is so serious that we have to stop and ask how we can do this much, much better. Fortunately, the international debate has moved a great deal. We have obtained a Paris agreement which obliges the countries to act and, step by step, in the COP negotiations, I think we are taking small steps forward. We're actually watching it. We see a European Union that has finally awakened, which has not yet decided on a policy that is close to sufficient, but that is the right direction. And then I see a little of our task as Members of this Parliament, along with our colleagues from other parliaments, as constantly asking how we can do better and better. When you talk about the need to react internationally to eco-murders, it is because each country often does not have the opportunities or the muscles to or dare or has the desire to react to oil companies, for example, when there are major oil pollutions. This is because we are dealing with huge multinationals which, through their economies, have extreme power, also politically, in many countries, and that is why it can sometimes help to raise their responsibilities and say that if we were some more to do so together, we would actually be able to oppose it. That is what we are doing in a number of areas in the European Union, in relation to tech companies, etc.; there is also the debate on nature protection, what we can do better together to bring about those who destroy. I think it is a good thing that we are discussing this today, and I am also very pleased with the adoption that was actually presented by the Social Democrat rapporteur, whom we are a broad group behind, because I think that it is pointing the way again. It actually shows that we take eco-mortage seriously and that Denmark should be involved in the debate on how we deal with this. When I think it is really good, it is also because we mention international forums, i.e. different forums in the world, because I am not sure that we will be the longest in being fixed on the Rome Statute now and here. I am actually concerned about how we are constantly moving on these agendas, and there I think we can go more quickly and further, and then in the long run we can get to the International Criminal Court, which should actually take care of it, I recognise that, but I do not think that this is how we are going to achieve it as quickly as possible. I would very much like this to be something where we are actively taking part in the debate within the European Union on this issue. So thank you to the authors of the question and thank you for the debate so far.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155026	There is a request for a few brief comments. It's from Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, Free Green. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155031	Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. We are, of course, very much in agreement. The rapporteur says about our home, that it needs to be given wider thought. Now I would say that ecocide actually means that it hits someone's home, and when I say our home, I don't think selfishly, then I think globally. It's the local people's home, but it's all our responsibility. It's about the planet and nature, and it's our home and our future. It's just to get it right. To the point about the time perspective: how fast should this development go before anything happens? That is crucial, because right now there are things that are burning up around us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155122	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155123	One can say that the development that has been in relation to this issue just since 2015, when I came to parliament and started to participate in these discussions, also in various international forums, has been extreme. Looking at the developments that have taken place within the European Union from the election of the Commission in 2014 to the election of the Commission and the European Parliament now sitting, there has been a quantum leap in relation to how to address these problems. Looking at the discussions at COP26 compared to COP15 in Copenhagen, what has happened is totally crazy. So I actually think it's going fast, but it's not going fast enough. That is actually what I was trying to emphasise. So I ask: how are we going to react as quickly as possible? There, I think, a fixation on the Rome Statute is wrong, because I believe that the perspective is too far. I think it's somewhere else we need to move. And we have the European Union as an institution that is very good at it, and when we move forward, we can get more with it internationally. But we also have the world goals as a motor for some of this, and I think we should see how we can use them properly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155230	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155231	For the point of moving: It is true that a lot has happened, but the breakdown of nature has not diminished. There are huge natural disasters happening around here, and we have huge climate change. It's gonna escalate like crazy. So we don't have time to wait. But okay, then we say that the Rome Statute is not the solution, but what else does the rapporteur have of proposals on how it can be resolved and how we actually get something concrete going?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155303	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155304	I would like to repeat what I said in my speech, because that has not been made clear enough. I think that the European Union is an obvious place to start this process in order for us to have the regulatory framework at international level. I think that when we look into the process that we are seeing right now and when we see the destruction that is right now on the planet, we can do two things. One can either say that we are taking that step by step and we are fighting every day for us to move forward to take care of the globe, or one can say that things are going very awful and that we see the ideal solution. I'm just a lot more pragmatic. I would rather take a small step every day than sit around waiting for a big step to be taken in the end.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155347	The next brief remark is to Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær, Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155349	The International Criminal Court does not prosecute countries, after all, it is individuals. For example: an army commander from Congo has been convicted because he led an army in which the soldiers were under 15 years of age. If you look at this eco-murder thing, who exactly are you thinking about? Well, it's gonna be a bit of a diffuse discussion. Is it the lumberjack in Brazil that chops down the rainforest that we all distance ourselves from? Who is this? Is it when a Chinese pours large portions of garbage into the sea, which is also stupid? It's just to put this point in perspective. After all, it is about individuals, not countries. So who are we after with this? Who is it expected that such a criminal court will prosecute for eco-mortacide in climate and environmental matters? I mean, it's a little easier when it's a general for an army of child soldiers; but who is it you have to prosecute if it's about logging in Brazil or pollution in China? Can the rapporteur give a few clarification examples of who we really are talking about?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155454	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155455	Yeah, I can, 'cause I think it's actually simple. It is rare for us to see a single lumberjack who cuts down a tree and thus destroys the Amazon; but there are some very large companies who have decided that now they want this forest area. There are some owners who have a responsibility. There are some owners of the oil companies who choose to produce oil in very vulnerable ecosystems, which pump oil up and do not make it safe because it is a little cheaper just to jump over where the yeast is lowest. And as a result we see some huge oil pollution. There are some owners of the companies that have a responsibility, and that is what we have to come for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155531	Sir. Dennis Flydtkjær.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155532	But is it not the challenge that, if it is now a company that operates legally in Brazil, whether you should prosecute the company for something where they have not broken a law there? Today there is a lot of debate about Aalborg Portland in Denmark, which is clearly a company that emits a lot of CO2 Should you then come after the owners when it is not illegal in Denmark? Well, who is it? Is it someone who operates legally around which we should then sit here in Denmark and say: Hey, hey, we don't care about Brazilian legislation, because we think they should be prosecuted. That is what the Minister has also said, namely that there is no case-law and no clear definition of what we are talking about. And when there is no such thing, it cannot be said to an international court that it should then judge about things that are not known at national level anywhere in the world whether they are actually illegal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155616	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155621	I look at the President and ask if I can have five minutes to repeat my speech, because I think I have answered everything that is being asked here in the speech I made. First of all, I said that this is a long process; we need to start with the European Union to get on with this. Secondly, that the countries do not have the legislation in place because they are often too vulnerable to individual companies and multinational companies that are so rich that they thus have a power over countries that need the economy that companies put in. So I really think I gave very clear answers in the speech. I would like to send a transcript, when it is ready on the Danish Parliament's website, to the questioner
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155653	Thank you, sir. Rasmus Nordqvist. Then there are no further brief comments to the rapporteur. And when a greeting from the Radical Left was delivered by the Social Democratic Party, it has become the Enhedslisten's turn to put on the platform. And this is sir. Christian Juhl as Enhedslisten's rapporteur. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420155718	Thank you for that to the President. The term may be new, but the problem is not new. I have been working with the IWGIA, that is, the organization of the indigenous peoples, which is both national and international, and they have talked over and over again about how to prosecute people who destroy their living conditions and thereby also destroy nature. They have talked about how to get a system so that they can get a replacement when it is that it happens that the rain forest is completely removed, which means that their way of life is destroyed. So there are around the globe people who have been working on this, and the IWGIA is one of those who have made their voices quite loud, especially in the United Nations. After all, the climate crisis is raging, and human carelessness and overexploitation of nature, the environment and animals are helping to destroy our ecosystems and accelerate the sixth mass extinction of species, global warming and the biodiversity crisis. That is the development, some say. But it's kind of wrong. This is manmade. In fact, almost always it is the pursuit of profit that has taken over, and then consideration of nature, animals, people and climate has been somewhat secondary. And that means we have to recognise that market forces are not doing this for us; we have to regulate globally and it is extremely difficult. When we are a few hundred countries in the world that have to agree on that, yes, it takes time, and it is really hard to put it right. And unfortunately, the climate crisis is increasing due to human actions in a global and national legal vacuum, where destructive actions against nature and the environment and other living beings than humans are little legally defined and thus harder to prosecute despite their serious nature. Therefore, recognition of eco-mortage as an international crime hanging over the International Criminal Court or somewhere else and in the Roman statutes or somewhere else will be an important step towards ensuring more climate justice. According to a significant group of legal experts, ecomords are an illegal or ruthless act committed by me, knowing that it can cause serious damage to the environment. It's a help to us that someone has formulated this. It's even a big help. We can move on there if we want to. Over the past many years, we have seen a series of eco-murders, particularly in the poorest part of the world, such as: Amazonas, and the fact that it is the poorest part, surely makes us up here in the more rich part of the world where we thrive well, take a little loose on it. And we just have to remember that we must not, because that will also threaten our reality. There has been a great need here for clear definitions and legal means of action, for example. indigenous people, whom I mentioned earlier, who have had their natural habitat destroyed by the oil companies etc. If it succeeds in getting the ICC to add the definition of ecomord to the Roman statutes or alternative options, it will be a crucial historical shift that can pave the way for an important recognition of nature and all living beings and the right they have in themselves as legal subjects. We have suggested in the past that climate and environmental considerations should be incorporated into the Constitution on the basis of the same reasoning or logic. The right to clean air and nature should be a right on an equal footing with all other freedoms. Recognition and dissemination of the concept of eco-mortality will send an important signal and warning to industry, businesses and individuals who already practice or plan to commit eco-mortage, often with profit in mind. The more people who experience legal pressure and greater attention to their actions, the more precedent we will be able to create for the deterrence and prosecution of the actors concerned, thus minimising the amount of eco-morder. Several countries, special countries, including island states, which are existentially threatened by the climate crisis, are actively promoting the addition of ecomord to the Statute. We should support this if we do not have any better proposals. Only in 2019, the European Parliament voted to call on Member States to promote the recognition of ecomords as an international crime. Here SF and Social Democracy voted in favour, but where were Radical Left, Left and Conservatives when we are looking for another platform to move forward? To the debate on the criminalisation of war crimes, I would just like to say this: Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen, Mali in those countries is also the destruction of climate, nature and the environment. Just look at the pictures we see every night on our TV. Not only houses are destroyed, but climate, environment and nature are also destroyed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160255	Thank you to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. There is a brief comment from Mrs Susanne Zimmer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160300	Thank you and thank the rapporteur for the speech. The rapporteur himself mentions the European Union, and in February 2022 the European Parliament has called on the Member States to support the criminalisation of ecocide under the auspices of the International Criminal Court and to examine how ecocide may be relevant to EU legislation. Does the rapporteur believe that this request is being taken in and that Denmark, for example, is being taken in? will take action in relation to doing something to support it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160341	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160343	Thank you. Now I have said on a few occasions on this platform that one of the most painful things I have experienced in the new government, in other words the Social Democracy, is that they were born in the sign of the wheelbarrow: they must both be lifted and pushed forward. It is a reality that we need to work on, and I can hear from the Minister that we must do so on this issue too. However, with my interpretation of this text of adoption that we are doing today, I interpret it as saying that at least we are now open to this. Then it is up to us, who, after all, are a majority, the government is a minority, to push. If this side is in on it, it's no problem to set some things in motion. I was thinking of a think tank, for example. under the auspices of the Nordic countries or under the auspices of the United Nations, but also under the auspices of Denmark. Why should we not be able to develop a system? Now I tried with that one, like others have done, that definition. Of course we can move on if we want to use some energy and some energy on it. That is why we have the criminal court today, in other words because someone has done a preliminary work and has moved on and said: we are insisting on a system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160459	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160500	[Sound emission]... Now the rapporteur also mentioned something about getting nature into the constitution. Does the rapporteur not also think that it could be a good basis for moving forward from an international perspective, for us to actually get nature into the constitution and for it to have its own rights?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160519	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160520	Yes, I fully agree with that, and that is why we have proposed it, twice I even think we should try to work on it. After all, the Constitution is not the kind of thing you just change in the Parliamentary Chamber, so it has to be increased before you get a majority in favour of it. But the United Nations is working on these things too, so that all beings on this planet have rights. That is why it is important for us to back up, and that is where the Minister is right, when we have to use all the forums, not to keep an eye on what is happening, it is too passive in my view. We have to act, we have to be active, and we may also have to be the ones taking the lead. We have been before in history, and the Nordic Region in particular has been, and that is why I point to the Nordic Region as a good place to start.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160602	Thank you to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160618	Yes, eco-mortage, it is of course an important issue to raise about the extensive interventions on nature and the environment around the world. It is also true that there is no case-law in this area. It is also because it is very, very difficult. What should be done when coral reefs die in Australia because of rising sea temperatures? Who is the reason for this? Many examples from the rain forest have been mentioned. That's right. It's sad too. Fortunately, we've all gotten smarter. There are also governments that may have granted permits that they should not have given. There have been deforestation, perhaps also in our own agriculture, which has not always been so appropriate either. There are very, very many players involved, and when do you set a start date? When is it really going to happen? This is important in order to also define what the criminal incident is if you are going to go so far. The proposal to amend the Rome Statute seems to us to be very problematic. After all, the Statute aims to bring to justice those who have committed serious crimes such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Court of Justice has had jurisdiction for crimes committed since July 2002 and thereafter. And it is a court that does not work without challenges. So it is also difficult to see how it should take in more. In addition, as the previous rapporteurs have said, we really have a challenge because there is no definition, no definition. This is difficult both for case law and for legal certainty. But, of course, we should not just give up and say that we will do nothing, because we need to talk into some of the options that exist. Some of the possibilities that exist are, after all, UN conventions. One that is an inspiring example is for example: I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which has been drawn up by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and for the excellent work done by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. This is a very good example of how the focus has now really been on all the endangered species and their trade. So the question is, is it not in some of the forums you should try to address these issues? For 1), the Rome Statute must be amended in relation to what its mandate is, and 2) it is probably not right here in a question debate in Denmark that we will have something as big as an international court. That would certainly require diplomatic climbing and a great deal of work. But that is why we support the text of the adoption, which says that this is something we want to work on. It is of course important that we can raise it in the relevant forums and also here look at among other things. The UN conventions and where there is an opportunity to do so. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160920	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Christian Juhl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420160923	I now think that the rapporteur of the Conservatives should be a little more optimistic in his thinking. We have to solve this problem. Humanity is notoriously threatened by the climate disaster that is on the way. We must act extraordinaryly, we must think extraordinaryly, we must find new ways. In the 1960s and 1970s in Denmark, Conservative politicians also said before the rapporteur about the requirements for the environment in Denmark that yes, yes, be careful, we also have to make money in Denmark, and how to organise the law, and should the old cases of crime with etc.? At that time we had a big problem, and there we had to draw a line and look forward and then say that now it may well be that it has been legal to pig in Grindsted and that it has been legal to dig chemicals into Harboøre Tange. We must resolve this jointly and also with public funds, but we have to say that in future it is no longer legal. So it is not so difficult to think such thoughts and start to put a strategy for it both nationally and internationally. Does the rapporteur not agree that we have to do so and that this can be done?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161040	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161042	I think it is very important, just as the rapporteur makes a distinction between it, i.e. what are national events. And the examples given by the rapporteur are precisely defined geographically, in other words where it is from, and it could be documented, among other things. Over at Grindsted, as mentioned. Internationally, precisely at COP26, it was mentioned and agreed that we should look at the global framework. Yes, we all have to do something, and that is also why the major industrial nations joined. That is also why China and the United States all of a sudden stood together and said that we must do something. That is also why we now need to update the national targets much more, namely every five years instead of every five years, because we have just seen that we must all do something, in other words help the developing countries that have been affected, including what is called loss and damage, affected by climate challenges. After all, it is both climate, but it is also what is being talked about here, namely eco-murder. It is also in relation to the direct eradication of, for example, the death penalty. a rain forest. A great many things are mixed together, and I think it is important that we focus on what we are talking about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161150	The questioner. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161151	Now, wise lawyers have tried to give a definition which I think is a good framework, because at least it says something like what we all think about these tables, I think. I therefore believe that we cannot wait. After all, we cannot say that we have to wait for a case-law, because we must first have a law or a decision before we can start establishing a case-law in a court of law and it has not yet been established. So we have to step out on new land one more time in human history. Well, we've done that countless times. We need to do it again, and that is why I believe that we need to speed things up. We have to think and act at the same time this time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161229	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161230	Does the rapporteur think that we are remedying this problem by having a court of law? I do not think that we are changing climate change in a court of law. We are now doing this through the combined pressure we put on each other by binding ourselves into the COP26 agreement, into the strong objectives of the European Union, into our own national objectives, and also into the framework in which we have the global objectives. It may get a little worn out, but there's actually something very important in • it's World Goal 12 • to look at also our own responsible consumption and production. It's all around. It is also that Denmark takes responsibility for the fact that we have been involved in increasing CO2 That is what we all have to do now. So there are many instruments, and that is what we need to work towards.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161314	Thank you very much to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Dennis Flydtkjær from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161327	Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the Free Greens for having raised the debate here in Parliament with this rather special headline on ecomortality. I have not come across a debate on this before either, among other things. I have only taken over this morning's debate for Søren Espersen, by the way. But it's not exactly a case we usually discuss so often, but that's why it can be important enough. What is behind this initiative is the desire for the International Criminal Court, as part of its tasks, to be able to deal with matters relating to the environment and nature, which must be included in the Statute of Rome in the Treaty. In this way, environmental and climate issues will be the fifth type of crime that the court should be able to deal with. The four present are, as has also been shown: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression, incredibly serious crimes which it is already dealing with. In the Danish People's Party we can say quite clearly that we think it is a rejection of these four whose environmental and climate issues must be dealt with side by side with these exceptional, extremely hard crimes. So we will not be supporting intention and I should be very surprised if there were to be a majority of the International Criminal Court Member States in favour of it. The challenge is fundamental, as the debate has also shown, that it is very indefinable what is actually involved. As the Conservative rapporteur said: if a coral reef in Australia dies out because of climate change, who is responsible for it? The Court of Justice, for example, judges. not countries; it judges individuals or companies which are also a legitimate person. Who is responsible for this if there is a coral reef that dies out? In other words, we are all opposed to this happening and we need climate action to prevent it from happening. But what exactly should a court do about such an act? It's pretty indefinable. There is no case-law in this area, as the Minister also says. So it's a little difficult to say that now we have to fight for eco-murder to be part of this court's tasks forward-looking, on the same footing as war criminals, genocide and other serious things. We in the Danish People's Party find this a bit difficult to see for us at this time. So we cannot support the text of the adoption tabled by the Social Democrats either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161555	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Christian Juhl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161557	I do not understand what the rapporteur has said. It is the case that if a company or a person in Denmark commits crimes, it is up to the prosecutor to prove it, and to the extent that a conviction can be handed down, we will punish him for the crime he has committed. This must also be the case in an international court. I understand the proposal to use the ICC. Why? Because they are used to working internationally; they are used to gathering evidence internationally; they are used to preparing matters; they are used to pointing out who is responsible; they are also used to making judgments. That is why it is important that such things continue to go away according to the rule of law, and it is important that we think this through completely, for example. the framework I mentioned earlier from skilled lawyers who have done the work. It's not that hard. Nor was it in Denmark when we got the first environmental judgment, so it was possible and it is still possible at international level too, if we want to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161709	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161710	It is quite true that it is essential to think it through. The problem is, you haven't done that. So, you compare with Danish law, and if you break Danish law, there is a clear case law. There is a court that can judge from clear legislation. But that is precisely the problem, that it is not there. What is the case law to judge by if there are coral reefs dying in Australia? Who are the individuals around the world to blame for this? You can't do that. Well, there is no burden of proof to lift at individual level. There is a collective responsibility as a society all over the world for this to happen, but who is it that a court should come after? No one can answer that, and the questioner cannot answer that either. So, yes, you have to think about it and think about it well, but that is the challenge of this debate, namely that there is no one there yet.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161755	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161757	It is clear that there are examples of this in Denmark too. Well, it's been discussed throughout my adult life, who was supposed to clean up the Harboøre tangle, because you couldn't place the responsibility. Nor can we do so in a number of cases, which have actually been eco-murders. It's nothing new that's starting to happen. This has happened many times. But it is very easy to take a case when a business for profit is cutting down the rainforest in Brazil. It's not hard to decide, it's very easy. There is someone who has done the crime, and there is also a crime that can be documented, so we just need a court to judge about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161836	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161837	There is a lack of a court in the event that a rain forest has been illegally felled in Brazil? Then I guess there's a court in Brazil that's gonna have to judge that business for it. Is there then a need for an international court to judge the local company for something? It's not. In other words, if there is a Danish company breaking the law in Denmark, is it a Danish court judging, and surely we do not need an international court to do so? So it doesn't play, it doesn't.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161900	The next brief remark is to Mrs Susanne Zimmer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161902	Thank you. Now the rapporteur says that the ecocide should not enter the servitute. But does the rapporteur not take the problem seriously with these major environmental disasters, where there is no response to it, so can one really just make a new extraction of raw materials or pour something into rivers that kill lives through several countries? If the rapporteur takes it seriously, where should it be placed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161935	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420161936	Well, I think the discussion is a little misunderstood. After all, it is not about saying that it is okay that you pour chemicals into a river, or that in huge million cities in China you just don't have any waste sorting and just pour it into the rivers, and then it ends up in the oceans and goes down into the fish's stomachs and creates huge imbalance in the ecosystem. But the problem is that it is undefined who is to be prosecuted. Is that the individual Chinese in town? Is that the city government? It can't be the Chinese state because you can't prosecute countries in this court. So who are you gonna come for? And if you don't know who you're gonna come for, what is it you're gonna use the court for? Then there's no effect of this. I think we all agree that we should try to get the Chinese to sort out waste and we should stop the Brazilians from cutting down the rainforest. But is the solution that international courts should sit and negotiate these things? Probably not, at least not from my point of view.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162023	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no more brief comments. Then we will give the floor to Mrs Susanne Zimmer to round off the debate. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162047	Thank you. I would like to say, as I said once before, that I am very pleased that we have had this debate, which has put this major problem on the agenda, and that a text for adoption has been drawn up, which many parties support, and which must therefore also make a difference. Of course, we in the Free Greens will be following this very closely, in relation to the fact that something is actually happening. Because we have huge challenges that I think there are a lot of people who have focused on. Then there may be different ways to get there, but achieving the goal is the most important thing, and we cannot wait. So thank you all for taking part in the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162134	Thank you. No one else has asked to speak and the debate is closed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162154	The debate is open and first we give the floor to Kasper Sand Kjær, the Socialists. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162201	Thank you for the floor. The aim of the bill we are now considering is to ensure better protection against the illegal trade in cultural objects. This stems from the regulation on the import and import of cultural goods which prohibits the entry into the European Union of cultural objects illegally exported by third countries. Overall, this means that the legislative proposal must help to ensure that we have the necessary tools for both apprehending, prosecuting and preventing the illegal trade in cultural objects. Throughout history we have seen plenty of examples that wars or invasions of countries have caused destruction and damage to cultural objects and that they have been robbed of their legal owners. At the same time, illegal trade in cultural objects has become a major business for criminal organisations. It also encourages illegal excavations of our cultural heritage. This threatens our entire cultural heritage as the world, and that is why we have an obligation to fight these illegal practices. This bill ensures that we now have four concrete tools. First of all, it is proposed that the penalty should be allowed to be in prison for up to two years if the prohibition of the regulation is violated either intentionally or through gross negligence and with financial gain in mind. Secondly, provision is made for the possibility, in certain cases, of withholding or confiscating cultural objects in the event of possible infringements. Thirdly, the draft law proposes the introduction of the legal basis for the transfer to the country concerned of cultural objects illegally exported by their country of origin. In this way, the right ownership can be restored. Fourthly, it is proposed that a legal basis be introduced for the cost of returning the item to be charged to the person who introduced the item in Denmark in breach of the rules of the regulation. With the four concrete measures in the legislative proposal, we are helping to ensure that we live up to our moral, our legal and our international obligations. And with those words, I can tell you that the Social Democratic Party supports the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162359	Then we would like to thank the Socialist rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Stén Knuth from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162411	Thank you, President. Thank you for the floor. In the Left, we believe that cultural objects are of enormous importance for culture, for our artists and also for the historical perspective, and we believe that in fact everyone in this Chamber thinks so. After all, we also want to safeguard the world cultural heritage, as the previous rapporteur mentioned, and we also want to make it possible to punish illegal imports between EU countries and third countries, including the possibility of stopping terrorist financing and money laundering. This allows the proposal, as we see it here: prison sentence and the power to seize and return. That is why the Left can support the proposal that lies here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162457	Thank you very much. There are no brief comments. Yes, I can see that Mr. Christian Juhl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162505	I am now trying to see whether the Left is the ruling party that they say they are, asking a question. On page 5 of the papers provided to us, there is a statement of detention in the section at the bottom of the first column and at the top of the second column: Once customs duties, duties, fines and costs have been paid, the goods detained or seized in accordance with customs regulations are released. Does this mean that if a criminal who has illegally tried to introduce a cultural value into Denmark is simply paying a tax, fine and legal costs, then he gets what he is illegally trying to introduce anyway? I think it's weird to read this. That is why I am asking the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162551	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162556	Thank you to the questioner. I cannot give an answer to that on a stand-by basis, but I think it will be one of the questions we have to raise when it comes to committee. I think it's a fine observation. I have not taken note of it myself, but of course we will take it into consideration in committee.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162614	Here you go. The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162614-2	I do not think we should wait until we have committee work. Then we must have the Minister answer that today. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162623	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. The next rapporteur is Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk from the SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162640	Today we first treat L 164 as introducing penalties for the import of illegal cultural objects into Denmark. The aim is to create common rules for trade with third countries and to ensure effective protection against the illicit trade in cultural goods and the preservation of cultural heritage. That is why we need to have proper protection of cultural heritage across countries, and we are now strengthening this by tightening up the penalties for the import of illegal cultural objects. Thousands of cultural objects are stolen every year from archaeological sites, museums in war zones and developing countries, and this helps rob communities and lands of their cultural identity and history. We also see that this helps to finance weapons and terrorism. It is therefore important that we in Denmark also support a joint coordination of actions and cooperation that put an end to the illegal sale and import of cultural objects. This bill lays down the penalty for infringement of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council prohibiting the import of cultural objects illegally exported from third countries. Furthermore, the draft law considers it necessary to lay down rules on how to deal with cultural objects after a possible judgment has been established. The regulation complements a number of other international legal rules designed to protect the world's cultural heritage and similar problems, and the SF supports this with its support for the bill. We look forward to the forthcoming committee work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162817	Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Zenia Stampe from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420162834	Thank you. I can also say that the Radical Left supports the proposal, which is of course important for two good reasons in particular. One is that it is a huge loss for a nation if you lose your cultural heritage. After all, we have ongoing cases of this, both back in the time when we have deprived other nations of their cultural heritage, but indeed also in areas affected by war and conflict, and where there are people who are taking advantage of that situation to usurp cultural objects and sell them to people in other countries. Of course, we must take action against this out of respect for others and our own nation. Then we shall also have to take action against this and that is the second reason why this has become one of the things on which criminal groups generate money. So I am constantly surprised when I stand in this Chamber about what criminals can make money from. It has not been long since I was in a debate about the import of dogs, the illegal import of dogs, which has also become a huge business for criminal gangs in Europe. That is why, of course, there is also a good reason to take action in this area, so that we do not create the basis for a criminal economy. With these words, I should just like to say that the Radical Left supports the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163002	Thank you to the radical rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Christian Juhl of the Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163010	Thank you, Mr President. This is a good addition to the rules that apply to the export and import of cultural values. After all, we have to recognise that our museums are filled with other countries' cultural values. Many of these things have not come nicely to Denmark. They have simply been stolen during colonial times, have been a war raid or have otherwise been taken to Denmark, and we show them nicely to the tourists. Many times the countries ask: Can we get our things back home? And once in a while we can negotiate that they can. We have a huge gap in international law in this area, and this means that the countries that have been out as colonial masters have more cultural values from countries other than the third countries that have tried to build up their countries and have had to tolerate Vikings and others going out into the world to take these cultural values away from them, as happened in colonial times, when we were going to see if we could enrich ourselves at the expense of others. This is not going to be resolved with this change of law, but here we are saying that if anyone comes to our border with some cultural values that they have illegally come into possession or that are not allowed to be imported into Denmark, then we must actively help to ensure that they do not enter our country. Of course, it takes a high standard of morality for a country to get so far into the legislation in relation to saying that we must also be involved in this, because it has been perfectly legal for many years now, while we have had museums, to do so. This also applies to university expeditions in the world, where cultural values have often been taken with them without asking if they could be taken into account. So I think it's really good that we get this set of legislation. I also think there is some ambiguity here, and if we cannot get an answer here, we must try to get it in writing or get it in committee, as one of the previous speakers mentioned. However, we can support the proposal as a small step in the right direction in order to distribute the cultural values that exist in the world to those who originally have the real ownership of them. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163228	Thank you very much to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mai Mercado, on behalf of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163237	Thank you. Every country has a responsibility to protect its cultural values, and that responsibility applies not only to the country itself but also to the international community. Central cultural values are important for the common cultural heritage of all peoples, and we must take that responsibility seriously. We must commit ourselves, both nationally and internationally. This is true in peacetime, but also when there are armed conflicts. Take a look at the countless examples of how cultural values belonging to the whole world have been destroyed and destroyed by, for example, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and how some of these have also been sold on. This bill arises from the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on the import and import of cultural objects which prohibit the entry into the European Union of cultural objects unlawfully exported by their country of origin. The aim is to prevent the destruction of cultural heritage by preventing the illicit trade in cultural objects, including preventing the economic gain of criminal organisations and terrorist groups through such destruction and trade. Selling cultural values is on long stretches as attractive as smuggling people and drugs, and it must be stopped. There is a need for increased international cooperation on these challenges. So in the Conservative People's Party, we wholeheartedly support harsh penalties and sanctions, even when it comes to protecting our cultural heritage. We must ensure the necessary tools in Danish law to enforce the regulation on the import and import of cultural objects illegally carried out by a country outside the European Union, and that is why the Conservative People's Party supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163421	Thank you very much to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Dennis Flydtkjær from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163430	Thank you. With this bill you can get up to 2 years in prison if you import some cultural object from another country, provided, of course, that it is also illegally executed from the country from which it originally comes, and we in the Danish People's Party think that makes very good sense. As a society, we appreciate the fact that we have a lot of good cultural treasures, something that tells us about where we come from as people, something that we can pass on to future generations, and I think it is quite obvious that as a country we also help other countries to be able to look after their good items. So we think it is a good thing that we help them to avoid an illegal import of cultural objects into Denmark. So we support this bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163516	Mr President, there is one brief comment. Christian Juhl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163518	I would like to hear how the Danish People's Party feels about the stolen values that lie in our museums, which actually tells us a little about where we come from, namely that we have been a colonial power and have thus been able to take what suited us at that time. Are they going to stay in the Danish museums or are they going back to those countries? It has nothing to do with this proposal, but it is in the same interest, it has to be said that it will also be resolved. It's not ours.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163554	It's actually hard to answer very squarely. Because, of course, we think it should go back immediately, but I do not think that is necessarily all you want back. Well, we ourselves have previously lost Jyske Law to the Swedes and then got it back in 2011, as I just remember, and we are really happy about that. But there may also be some things we do not necessarily have the great urge to do, because we have lots of other objects similar to those in Denmark. So it's hard to answer squarely. However, it is clear that there will be a request from a neighbouring country or something else which says that we have something that is really important to them, but it is not something that fills and is really important to us, so I think as a fundamental principle that we should be willing and deliver it back so that it can be exhibited in their museum instead. But there is, for example. also a lot of objects back from the Viking Age and other. Is that all that needs to be returned? No, not necessarily. But it is clear that we have to take it on a case-by-case basis, and if there is something that is really important for another country, then I think we should look at it favourably.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163650	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163651	Of course somebody needs it, otherwise you can't give it to anyone. That's one thing. But for example... After all, the Icelanders wanted the last Icelandic writings back to Iceland, and I myself was involved in some documents that the Norwegians wanted, which mean a great deal to them, and where one of our institutions then said that no, no, we can neither borrow nor give away, although they are actually Norwegian documents. That is why I think there is an unfinished business here which, as a decent and decent nation, we have to live with having to take a stand on and also try to find better methods than those we are using today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163729	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163730	I understand the question, but it is difficult to answer squarely, as I also said in the first round. For Iceland and Denmark have a common history in many areas, so to speak that one of them belongs to one country or another, it can be quite difficult in some areas with these objects. And the same is true of Norway, with which we also have a huge common history. So to cut it open and say that they should have everything they ask for or that we should deliver everything they think they have had a right to, is not so simple when you have a common cultural history with some of these countries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163802	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no more brief comments. The next one on the platform is the Minister for Culture. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420163818	Thank you very much, and above all thank you to all the rapporteurs for their comments and support for this bill, which comes from the regulation on the import and import of cultural objects, which contains a ban on the importation into the European Union of cultural objects illegally exported by third countries. And in this way, the bill follows our international commitments, as several have also mentioned. At the same time, however, I would also like to emphasise that the government is very much in favour of the aim of precisely this ban, which is to curb illegal international trade in cultural heritage. That trade is a threat to the world's cultural heritage. It means that objects that should be accessible to research and the public disappear into closed circuits instead. And trade is often accompanied by considerable destruction. The illegal trade encourages illegal excavations, and such excavations destroy monuments and archaeological sites and mean that crucial knowledge of the past, created by professional excavations, is lost. Some illegally traded cultural heritage has its origins in civil wars and other conflicts and comes from outright looting, both of monuments and museums. And criminal organisations can make very big money from the illegal trade in and illegal excavations of cultural heritage. That is why it is important that, with this proposal, we have penal provisions linked to the prohibition of the regulation. As the draft law shows, it is also for this reason that the penal provisions are laid down in the light of the fact that this is a serious crime which is likely to result in prison sentences. There is also a need for a few necessary measures to ensure that the ban in the regulation can have the necessary effect. There may be cases where there are no other infringements, i.e. where, for example, there are cases where there are no other infringements. We have not made any attempt to hide the item and where customs duties have been paid, and with this we ensure that we have the necessary provisions. Perhaps that is also the answer to some of the questions raised by Mr Beyer de Ryke. Christian Juhl's side. In other words, it is the case today that if you have paid your customs duties, the item will be released, and with this proposal you can withhold the item, even if customs duties have been paid. There is also a need to ensure that, in accordance with the intention of the regulation, items can be returned to their country of origin once we have found that they have been illegally exported. We also ensure that there is a legal basis for this. I look forward to a good and constructive discussion in the Danish Parliament and, if there are any further questions, there is, of course, ample opportunity to get answers to them in the committee work as well. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164111	Thank you to the Minister for Culture. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Christian Juhl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164114	Yes, it is about the paragraph I read before, namely that it is the law in force in Denmark today that when you have paid customs duties, taxes, fines and legal costs, you can get your goods back. Is it going to be the case with the new law that the objects can Well, I think it must be our duty as a decent nation to say that, of course, we are returning something that has been tried illegally introduced into our country if it is a cultural value from another country. It may well be bought from a private person in the other country, but it has to go back to the country which is the legitimate owner of that cultural value.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164200	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164201	There is, of course, ample scope for the individual nuances of the wording to be fully unfolded when there is committee work, but what is provided for here is firstly that items can be withheld, even if customs duties have been paid, and that items, if illegally exported by the country of origin, can be returned. There is no legal basis for that today, and that is what we are creating the legal basis for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164226	Here you go, sir. Christian Juhl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164227	What is the reason for not making a rule that they should be reversed if it is possible to identify the nation that owns them?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164234	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164235	I would very much like us to be able to unfold in the committee's work those specific wordings in terms of their legal significance and why there may be a need to secure legal basis, but not an automatic one. But let us get the answer to all the questions which should be of a legal nature in relation to the specific wordings, in committee work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164256	Thank you to the Minister for Culture. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Culture. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164309	The debate is open. We give the floor to the Minister for Culture first.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420164324	Thank you very much for the floor and thank you for the opportunity to discuss e-sport here today. E-sport is something that increasingly absorbs a great many. This applies to both our children and young people, but also to adults. I personally, I would just like to make it quite clear here today, is rounded by the more physical, traditional Association Denmark with communities created in the gym, in the swimming pool, on the handball field and on the football field. That's what I'm done with. That's what my world comes from. But when I sit and look into these developments in these figures as the Minister of Culture, you just have to conclude that e-sport has not only come to stay, but is also increasingly something that a lot of people grow and spend time on. When I so clearly declare what I have a predestination for, namely the physical sports and other physical communities, it is precisely because I believe that when you hold the two things against each other, e-sport presents a number of challenges that do not exist in the same way in the other kind of activities. The splits are owned by large international companies, which determine the rules and conditions of the games, and sometimes some incentive structures are put in place in the games, so our children and young people risk both spending a lot of money in the games, but also being stuck in front of the screen for many hours. It itself contains problems and challenges. Increased screen time in itself has negative consequences, and I believe that the rest of us, who sit in front of a screen and are drawn from it, are also aware of this. You move less, and the many sedentary hours in front of a screen can also cause physical injuries such as wrist injuries, eye injuries and back and neck injuries. And when you sit behind a screen a lot, it is also, we can see from surveys, easier to talk ugly and harass others, just as we also experience problems playing out on social media. The hateful sayings affect everyone, but we can see from the very same studies that they particularly affect girls and women, who unfortunately often experience sexist and discriminatory comments when they play. I think that is simply a huge problem. That said, e-sport also offers a lot of opportunities, both for skills and for communities. The e-sport can be grown by everyone on an equal footing regardless of gender, age and physical prerequisites, and in many games teamwork and communication are crucial to success. E-sport is primarily driven by private initiative, and private e-sport organisations are working seriously to teach children and young people how to get involved in e-sports. But also in association, in sports organisations, in afterschools and in leisure clubs, even in the IOC, e-sport has become an integral part of the activity portfolio. In Denmark, for example, organizations such as: Esport Denmark, DIF, DGI, Danish Company Sports, afterschools and Youth Ring structured with e-sports, and it is worth noting both in collaboration and separately. The latest membership figures from DIF, DGI and Danish Company Sport show that in 2021 there were 7,200 e-sport members spread over 300 associations. If we go back just 5 years, the figure in 2017 was 2,300 in 80 associations. So it is a very violent development and a very violent growth. And there are collaborators, afterschool leagues, youth leagues, etc. Fortunately, it is also the case that e-sport today is widely recognised and financially supported in Denmark, both by local authorities and by state funds. The local public awareness e-sports associations are provided with premises and receive grants from the municipalities just like other public awareness associations. So there is no difference in whether you play football, go to scouts, go to school or do e-sports. This is important both for recognition and for dissemination. And then there are the other public funds for e-sports. The distribution funds are already funding e-sports activities in DIF, DGI and Danish Company Sports. Esport Denmark has also received distribution funds for a number of years, and most recently, with the Danish Finance Act 2022, we decided to support Esport Denmark with a finance bill in 2022. All of this helps to support the positive development of association sport, and I think it is important that we continue to support politically that e-sport can be grown under proper conditions in association life, rather than that it will be largely alone at home in front of the screen. However, I am not sure that the Left's proposal for a state-established working group is the right way to go about giving e-sport better opportunities for development. E-sport seems to thrive very well. E-sport is already recognised as independent activity on an equal footing with football, scouts and other activities under the Resort of the Ministry of Culture. We do not need a working group to clarify that. In addition, even for a number of years, the Left has also supported e-sports in the implementation of the Ministry of Culture's sports act. Overall, the government cannot agree to the motion for a resolution. Despite the fact that e-sport remains young, I sense that e-sport in Denmark is somewhere else today than it was when the former VLAK government strategy was created in 2019. At that time, I believe that e-sport was more fragmented than it was today. There is now better cooperation between the organisations in this area, and we have national leagues where the breadth, talents and elite can compete both privately and socially. We have also continued some of the best practitioners and teams in the world who inspire and set standards on how to work with professional e-sports. It is all created by the organisations' own initiatives and without further political involvement. E-sports has shown that they can, and they can be proud of that, but that does not change the fact that, of course, we also need political discussions about how it will be the Community-driven values that also operate e-sports. Thank you, therefore, for putting it on the agenda and thank you for the general commitment of the rapporteur on this matter. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165013	Thank you. There are a number of brief remarks. The first is from Mrs Mai Mercado. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165018	Thank you, and thank you for the declaration for sport: this is something that is going on in a handball hall. I'd like to be more detailed, too. I have a son who games, and I can say that being a mother and not just hugging, but actually applauding it, is something that means a lot to my son and I think it does for a lot of young men who game and spend a lot of time on it. And that's actually a lot: as much as 41 percent. Of the 16-20-year-olds, they're gamers. I think they may feel that it is a bit of a cold washing when it is simply swept away by the fact that sport is to be understood narrowly, and that it alone is something that happens, for example, in a swimming pool or a handball club. So I just want to ask you so openly for a start: Thought sports, for example chess, isn't it a sport?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165104	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165105	Actually, I can't even recall that's what I said. I declare that this is what I am rounded up by myself, and then I say that some of what is the strength of it is precisely the physical communities. I believe that one of the things we need to work politically for is that e-sport also exists in the framework where you are physically together in an association activity and not only at home behind the screen. It is certainly not a write-off of e-sport; on the contrary, it is an embrace that it has come to stay and that very many find great value in it. It is also a recognition of the fact that we have supported e-sport financially as recently as the 2022 Finance Act and are also doing so with means of distribution, and that it is recognised by local authorities in line with the other research activities. On the contrary, it is actually a very great recognition that e-sport is something that matters a lot and that there is potential for e-sport also to be found in a framework that we know from the more traditional Association Denmark, and thus can also provide that kind of community. I think that is what we should try to shape politically as well.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165211	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165212	I would like to give the Minister an opportunity to answer the question, which was actually whether chess can be described as thought sport and thus as sport. And then, when the Minister himself brings up the issue of creating healthy communities, I would just like to say: does the Minister not agree that it is easier to create a healthy community if you create an organisational framework in which you, among other things, are able to create a healthy community? ensure that you have a growth layer to promote tomorrow's talents, such as the Astralis stars have proved to be, or does the Minister think that it is easier if you do not have an organisational framework?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165247	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165248	That is exactly what I said in my opening speech: I welcome the fact that it has developed to such an extent. Not only have you gone from about 2,000 to 7,000, you have also gone from a more fragmented picture to actually having some strong framework around exports. And I think that is what we should try politically to tap into in relation to actually also ensuring that it becomes something that creates communities for those who use e-sports.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165317	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165321	Thank you. Thank you for the Minister's more nuanced speech in relation to e-sports. I'm probably where I don't want to discuss whether e-sport is a sport at all. It is here, and there are a lot of children, young people and adults who grow it every day.In fact, it is probably more than in the world of sport. And I do not want to be too backward-looking either, because we have lagged far behind politically in supporting this and creating some of these good frameworks. I would like to ask the Minister about the financial framework. From the SF's side we threw ourselves into the finance negotiations to get just a minimum of a grant for Esport Denmark, otherwise nobody specially looks after the sport and tries to develop how we can be better in relation to children and young people and actually create a better structure around it. And we've only reached 2 million. kr., which stands as a frighteningly small amount compared to the many large amounts we give to other organizations. Can the Minister see that it is time for us to give serious political support to this, including in the form of serious financial support?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165430	Thank you. The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165432	Here I think it is important to maintain that, in addition to the financial regulation, there is also financial support for e-sport through a number of other channels, which I also mention in my speech from means of distribution to support via DIF, DGI, Danish Company Sport, for example. have premises made available in the municipalities, etc. in exactly the same way as many other associations and organizations. So there are a large number of ways to support and back up e-sports. One thing is recognition, another is financial support. I actually experience that we do both together, and I very much recognise that SF plays a major role in this work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165517	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165519	Thank you. I'm glad the Minister has discovered that. But I would like to go a little closer, because it can be said that what is still going on in the whole of e-sport in general is the game of chance, and it is also because we have simply not tapped into the fact that this is an important sport in Denmark, and that it is important for a great many children, young people and adults, that it has a broad sport or at least there is such a local out there, even when they sit together separately, but also that we are banners at the professional level. Isn't it time we went in and supported it more politically and organisationally, rather than just leaving it around a little, a little randomly?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165600	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165602	Well, I will not deny that we are not only discussing this today, but also in the time that comes, diving even more into how it can be shaped in the future. I mean, it's going really fast, and we can see that just the figures from 2017 to 2022 show a quantum leap, and I can't even predict where we'll be in five years' time in this area. So, of course, there is a need for political involvement, and of course there is also a need for e-sport to be recognised. I think we are doing this very much. And I welcome the fact that it has come to a less fragmented place, because then it is precisely in a framework where it can be shaped, also in the light of some of the desires for community etc. that I know we share.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165642	The next brief remark is from Mr. Stén Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165645	Thank you. And thank you to the Minister for the speech. I am also formed by the association life in connection with taekwondo, where it is about physics and the fact that you sweat and touch each other and are in a community and all that. I've tried one of these shooters a couple of times and been bashed down, and it's not for me. But I can see and hear that it's got it out there. All we know about this is that it's got hold of the young people and also the adults. 700,000-800,000 sits every day playing e-sports or gamer. Danish Industry sets off employees to look at what potential it has, and Dansk Erhverv does the same. Wonderful Copenhagen also begins to see if they can make big events with this. So it is not only the volunteers and the community, it is also the commercial part, the schools and vulnerable children who benefit from this. You've also started researching what this e-sport really can do. In this way, it is in a great many directions, and that is why I would also like to say, like the SF rapporteur, that it is so difficult that there is a need for a clear strategy from the Folketing for what we should be supporting. Would the Minister not acknowledge that this could be a way to go?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165805	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165806	I would like to repeat that I will not deny that we are discussing the further development of e-sport. For the rapporteur is quite right that this is something that matters to a great many people, and I believe that, regardless of how we otherwise recognise it and support it, we should take a political view of what we want, for example, to do. Our children's young people are busy, and how much time we want them to spend on it. So in addition to trying to support it, to acknowledge it and to support it locally, also via DFI, DIF, Danish Company Sport, etc., I think that it also taps into some of the other discussions we have, especially in the area of children and young people, among other things. in relation to the fact that we want them to move more, etc. So how do we get all around that discussion so that we have both consideration for e-sport and the development of it, and at the same time also have the full perspective on our children and young people's upbringing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165914	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165915	Thank you. It's a hoax that e-athletes don't move. Then the Minister really has to go out and ask those who have to do with it, because they actually do. It's just to make it clear. The Minister also mentioned some challenges in relation to this with screen time, rules and ugly language, especially to girls, and I agree with that, but there are other challenges that are just as great: Match fixing, hidden advertisements in the games and contracts that do not keep legal. There are very, very many areas here that require both the Folketing and the government to take this on themselves and make a strategy on how to help the whole area, which in many ways tends in several directions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165957	Thank you. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420165958	I fully recognise that we have a string of these discussions which are the result of the fact that it is an activity that is growing and that we will therefore also have to follow it in the coming years. I believe that we are on the basis of the fact that there is a good framework for e-sporting in Denmark, that there are also some of the more established organisations on the field to create some of the framework, and that we also have the offers that we now have to our associations across the country. And, of course, we also have to deal with the commercial part and some of the more problematic in this context.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170043	The next brief remark is to Mrs Zenia Stampe. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170046	It is not a polemical debate issue, but rather a matter of knowledge. As Minister for Culture, Mrs Mette Bock set up an e-sports panel to work just before the elections, and the plan was to hold a series of meetings in 2019, and then there should be some recommendations by 2020, and I have searched and searched the web, but I cannot find them. So I just want to know if the Minister knows anything about what happened to that e-sport panel, i.e. whether there were ever any recommendations, because it was, as far as I could pollute, actually the Ministry of Culture that was at the head of that e-sport panel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170134	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170135	Thank you. We are on the back of the fact that back in 2019 a strategy for e-sports was developed. I see, both when I look into the development myself, but also when it is reflected in the rapporteur's remarks today in several different forms, that a lot has happened since, although it is in a short time, and in this way I think that if you are going to use it, it will be updated, that is, if that is the way you want to go. But I think it was hit by several things. This does not alter the fact that during the period since the change of government there has been continuous support for e-sports, recognition of it and financial support for it, and that there is also recognition that it finds an increasingly organised form, while there are more and more people using the activity, both children, young people and adults.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170228	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170230	I think perhaps something has gone wrong in the ministry, because as I can read out, a work was put up with four meetings, and it may well be that it has been cancelled because the new Minister for Culture, Joy Mogensen, may have stopped work because she had not initiated it. It is not, in fact, at all to tease the government or anything, it is just because part of the strategy was actually the setting up of a panel that would then have to make some recommendations. When I'm interested in those recommendations, it's because I know nothing about e-sports, but I can hear that there are so many perspectives in it, and that is why I really just think it would have been very interesting if those recommendations had come, so we had something more concrete to work on. But it may not be a question, but just a call for the Minister and the rest of us to go back and talk to those who sat in that panel and find out what they really got to if they got together at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170333	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170334	I would like to reiterate that I believe that the way forward, if new knowledge is sought, is to address some of the major stakeholders in this area, who are actually working seriously and organised with the anno 2022, because there are a lot of people who do that, among other things. DGI and DIF and Danish Company Sport and Esport Denmark. So we have some serious forces working on this, and they also have eyes for some of the kinds of ideas that know that, among other things. Mr. Sten Knuth also mentions, and that is some of the knowledge we among other things. I think we should go politically.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170408	Thank you to the Minister for Culture. There are no more brief comments. The first ordinary rapporteur is Mr. Malte Larsen of the Social Democrats. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170428	Thank you very much. And I would like to thank the Left, with the rapporteur at the forefront, for putting this on the agenda. We share a great interest in e-sports. I have never played myself, but I have six children, and most of them I have only seen my back off for long periods. They sit with their noses inside the screen and maybe for longer than it actually is really healthy. I think I see both the pros and cons of long-term e-sports. There are estimated to be hundreds of thousands who engage in e-sports on a daily basis. Denmark is doing fantastic at elite level. As a family, we even went on holiday to give some of the boys the opportunity to experience a great event in Germany, Cologne. So there is also a potential for tourism, a potential for business. It is a fascinating world, but there are, as the Minister also mentioned, deep pitfalls: Lootboxes, where you get money, learn to game and maybe develop gambling. There are examples. The games, as we talked about, are not typically democratically based as opposed to the rest of the sports world. After all, we held a very exciting hearing on e-sport in the house at the beginning of March. We had many nuances and needs elucidated. E-sport is coordinating its interests and is increasingly united in safeguarding the interests of sport. The large federations are increasingly organizing it. It is also pleasing. E-sports has access to the public-evidence means of activity in addition to the whole country. We also support Esport Denmark through the distribution funds. The motion for a resolution here will impose the setting-up of a working group to present recommendations for a revised e-sport strategy. We look forward to the subsequent discussions in committee, because this is an important area and it will be exciting to discuss it. However, the Social Democrats do not believe that a revised strategy is needed and we cannot therefore support the resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170704	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are a few brief comments. First of all, it is Mrs Mai Mercado of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170708	Thank you. I have to say that I was a little confused by the Minister's speech, because on the one hand she says that she wants to embrace e-sports and that she thinks it is important, but on the other hand there is not such a real sport unless it is grown in a handball hall or at least is a physical community, one has to understand. She would also like to discuss it very much, but she does not want to draw up a strategy in this area anyway. So I would just like to ask: what has the government taken of initiatives that promote e-sport in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170741	I thought I heard a minister hugging e-sports, and she started by praising what is going on out there in the world, and said that quite a lot of things work really well, fortunately, and are well supported out there. We support the organisations that are working on this positively, and it must be the most important thing for us that we do not start to invent anything, but rather listen to the organisations that are working on it out there. I only heard one big embrace of e-sports and of what we're doing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170814	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170815	Yes, I did, but how on earth can you say that you hugg e-sport and will listen to the players, when it is the players themselves who come and say that they want to have an e-sport strategy because that is the way to move forward? Now it is the case that when you are rapporteur in a government party, you have access to all the documents that the Minister also has access to, and that is why you can quizze a rapporteur from down here, and then it is just crazy that when you ask what has been taken by initiatives, the only true answer is that exactly zero initiatives have been taken in relation to e-sport since the government came in. Isn't that right?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170855	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170857	I don't think that's right. I mean, I referred, among other things. that we had had a hearing in here where we just put this high on the agenda and clarified what problems and challenges were faced. The answers were not clear. It was a great deal that we have a lead and that we have a process going on, which is also about listening to the parties. That's what we did that day. I do not know if Mrs Mai Mercado was present.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170926	The next brief remark is to Mr. Stén Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420170928	Thank you and thank the rapporteur for the speech. When I listen to it, there are many challenges we have to deal with, and there are many pitfalls. And I hardly recognize the rapporteur because I too, with the rapporteur, have been visiting some of the places in which we have common interests and have had many good conversations and, in fact, also made agreements on e-sports in relation to the consultation to which the transferor refers just now. But will the rapporteur not confirm that the rapporteur sees the same potentials that are actually well under way out there in the primary school about it with young people and vulnerable and the whole commercial, i.e. the large organisations that have also taken the initiative to do some things in this area? Isn't that the way we need to look rather than fall into the pot with there being a lot of challenges that we don't know the answers to and that there's probably a bit going on out there and they're gonna be okay?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171034	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171036	There's really a lot going on out there. And I actually tried to be very positive, because I see many of the potentials, and fortunately I also see that there is a huge activity going on out there. And by far most of it is not organized in associations, but something you sit with at home. I also heard the remark earlier that movement is connected to e-sports. I think that is quite right in relation to the thousands organized under some of the federations. But I am equally sure that this is not the case with what I see at home in my family, what I hear about others doing, and the hundreds of thousands of people who have gaming on a daily basis. I think there must be more movement connected to e-sports. But I fully recognise that there is a huge potential that is in the process of being redeemed out there, and Denmark is very strong already on this international stage.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171133	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171134	But I also hear from the rapporteur that there is a great deal of work going on out there in all sorts of areas. And, of course, I also heard the Minister say that it was against setting up a government working group. The rapporteur is, of course, well aware of those we wanted to invite in for an interview and who should help shape the strategy that we as a country should have for this, whether it is about education or research or the commercial one. Can the rapporteur not see that drawing up a strategy in which we invite these parties who are going to be involved in shaping the strategy could also be a way, given that both the rapporteur and the Minister have embraced this with love?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171215	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171217	After all, we fully agree that we have had lots of visits, and fortunately it also looks as if Esport Denmark is finding its legs on and that the internal tensions that have been in e-sports are something that is a thing of the past. This work has been backed up for a long time, and I think it is the right path to go on, that is to say to back up the initiatives that we are also doing and to ensure that they stand very strong in the organisation that can be in e-sport. We did not want to interfere in other areas at the level of detail for which the rapporteur is exponent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171254	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171257	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. I wonder why we are not talking about making more movement when playing chess. In other words, we must be very careful not to drive a car and now I apologise to the rapporteur over here for being very conservative in approach or at least a slightly outdated way of dealing with e-sports, because then it is that e-sport is running away from us and it is already. If we do not do anything, we will lose the leading position that we have in the professional field. However, we are not going to do anything about what the rapporteur actually mentioned in relation to the pitfalls that exist. Isn't that exactly why we need to get on the ground and talk about a strategy and how we can give real support that you can work with to Esport Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171356	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171358	I think we should be careful not to think that we can legislate out of everything here in this house. Instead, I think it is really fine, as we did with the hearing, to get a light on the challenges that are there. If I may put pictures on it, I recognize all sports activities as sports. This is the case with chess, which I have mentioned sometimes, e-sports. But I think that the loss of movement, let me put it in the way that so many people know, and here we are talking mainly about young men, sitting many, many hours in their room and running a race both alone and with comrades, because I can see that it is going on as a social event. So it's something bigger when hundreds of thousands of people play e-sports on a daily basis at home at the screen than by thousands of people in addition to the whole country playing chess in a club.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171501	Thank you. Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171502	But what do we do about it? Should we just leave them alone? Should we pretend it's not there? Should we pull the kids out and push them to run? Or should we try politically to take responsibility and take a position, in other words to strengthen it so that we can have some good ways of doing it? Astralis has been a very good example of how to introduce healthy diet, mental training, movement and proper forms of work around e-sport. Why aren't we going in and doing it, and, for example, by supporting Esport Denmark and making some strategies for it, but also creating a national strategy for it? We were out visiting a small association where we came from, and everything went a little dead. And there I am thinking precisely of the fact that such things as Esport Denmark could help to dress the local associations. How do they keep these local e-sport clubs going?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171552	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171554	I think we should be careful not to exaggerate what we can so exaggerate the effect of what we can from here on because our task is precisely to set the framework. I think the best lead we can pursue is to back up the fact that the sport organized finds its own legs to stand on and then back up the work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171613	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. No one else has asked for the floor for short remarks. The next rapporteur is Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk from the SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420171638	Thank you. In the SF we are pleased to have the opportunity to debate e-sports and thereby also send a great praise to Mr. Mr Stén Knuth for having tabled the motion for a resolution. We are because e-sport in Denmark has enormous potential and offers a great many opportunities, but also challenges that we need to address. The number of young boys as well as girls who are currently engaged in e-sports has, to put it mildly, exploded, and we must actually support that development, but we must also set a good framework for it. E-sport has come to stay, and future generations will be very much presented with exports, and those who are already engaged in e-sports will be maintained in interest. That is why it is important that we deal with what is going to be done from a political point of view, so that e-sport develops in an appropriate way. When e-sports has come to stay, we are way beyond asking whether it is at all a sport or not. So it has been somewhat surprising at SF that a few weeks ago the Minister for Culture presented an outdated approach to sport here in Parliament and that the Minister sees sport as something that takes place in a hall and a dressing room. Then I understand that the Minister has clarified it a little and that it is a little different, but I would like to warn against that position, because it belongs to another time. In the SF, we feel different. Association life and sport come in many colors and forms, and the framework for sport changes constantly. Whatever form, e-sports as well as other sports can help to ensure community across income, social status and other social differences. The explosive development of e-sport in Denmark has taken place in a relatively commercial image. The major tournaments are sponsored by multinational companies that see a huge potential in influencing young people. When young people are gaming today, they are exposed to behavioral design as targeted advertisements, from which we usually try to protect children and young people. This is a problem which Esport Denmark is also aware of and which requires information campaigns aimed at parents, who are often not aware of the dangers that are hidden. But it also requires that e-sport be taken seriously from the political point of view. E-sports must develop appropriately in Denmark, both in terms of protecting young people who game in leisure time, but also to ensure that the professionals have proper contractual relations. In addition to the fact that e-sport can help strengthen the association life that we in Denmark are so famous for and, in fact, very proud of, e-sport can be used to further train young people in IT and digitalise the Danish school system, create communities across social divides and countries and communities for those who struggle with loneliness other problems. IT education and training can also help to strengthen defence and Denmark's security in a recovery time, and it can also be a way into society. This can inspire young people to discover and engage in other sports and communities. Therefore, we in the SF are incomprehensible that the government does not agree that financial support of 2 million. kr. not enough when several thousand children each day engage in e-sports. We need to be more ambitious, and we need to have a national e-sport strategy that can be a real guarantee of Foreningsdanmark, including when it comes to e-sports. It must be a strategy that can also help define the way e-sport is grown. Very many parents do not know how to talk to their children about e-sports, and this is also true in schools, and it is important that they get enough knowledge of it so that parents and teachers can talk to young people about their experiences and support them both in their interest, but in fact also in making the right choice. This can help create the necessary dialogue to ensure that e-sports will be defined by good and healthy values. In SF we see great potential in sport, and we also recognise its value in that there are so many who cultivate it on a daily basis. Therefore, we would like to support e-sports associations in spreading it into the Danish association life, so that children, young people and adults have the opportunity to cultivate their interest in the community framework. And with these comments we look forward to working on the motion for a resolution, whether it ends in a report or how we do, we shall have to look at it. But I think our ambitions for e-sport must be high.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172115	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Stén Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172117	Thank you. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, for whom I am happy to vote. And thank you very much for our cooperation in this area of e-sports and gaming and all the potential that the rapporteur also mentions here. That's a real pleasure to hear. May the rapporteur just turn a few curls on some of the challenges that SF is also facing here, and perhaps also make a few comments on how we can solve them if I may ask the rapporteur that question?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172146	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172147	Well, first of all, I believe that we should have a strong Esport Denmark, which can be very capable of helping and developing what the rapporteur also proposes strategies for. Well, what do we do with children and young people? How do we dress them? How do we dress our parents for the conversations? How do we talk to our kids about e-sport? And how can we see the danger signals; what are we looking for when we know there are also these pitfalls of e-sports? That's one part. The second part is that e-sports generally goes very well in Denmark, but it is challenged by lack of organisation. It is very random whether you can be picked out as a professional, and there I would really like to work on how we can secure the way up into the ranks of the professionals and also the semi-professionals.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172239	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172241	Thank you. That was an excellent answer; thank you very much. We actually have a very well-functioning talent development programme in Denmark, which is located over in Team Denmark. Could the rapporteur see some comparisons in relation to also drawing out the knowledge that lies in Team Denmark and also to being able to create the talents of the future or the Astralis or Tricked of the future, i.e. those who are at the top of the shame at the moment?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172307	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172308	Yes, and I think it is obvious to look at what structures are already in place that we can use. I also think we should give them that recognition because they actually do a lot for Denmark when they also game as much as they do around the world. All you have to do is take one of these major events, and then you understand what size and importance this really has. And if we close our eyes to the importance that also applies to the elite level, we will also close our eyes to what young boys and young girls really look up to and really reflect themselves in.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172343	Thank you very much to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Zenia Stampe from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172357	Thank you. Thank you for a truly exciting debate and a good and important resolution. I haven't spent many hours in a handball hall, but I haven't spent many hours with e-sports either, so I'm hit by ignorance in this area either. Perhaps that is why the debate has been so exciting for me to follow. At the same time, I have also tried to search the web for what the old strategy actually contained. And it is actually quite interesting that it ended up with the setting up of an e-sports panel, which was to meet four times in 2019 in order to draw up recommendations to be presented in 2020, in relation to some of the issues we have discussed today, both about the potential for sport, but also about some of the areas where there are some challenges, i.e. how to build a strong association life around e-sports. etc., that is to say some really relevant issues, which have all been mentioned today. It is a pity that that panel has not been allowed to finish its work. I understand the motion for a resolution as a continuation of the work that had been started but which was interrupted because of the elections and perhaps also because of corona, or what may have been for reasons why the ministry stopped that work. After all, there are just some things that are lost by a change of government. But I started by going to this resolution with a wonder, because I thought: there was an e-sport strategy in 2019, so how can we already need a new one now in 2022? However, after reading it, where I can see that part of the strategy was the setting up of a panel which was then not allowed to work and, having heard the debate today, I very much hope that we will be able to continue working on the proposal. In any case, I would like to say that we would like to do so. Whether we vote for the proposal itself or whether we prefer a report, I and my group have not yet taken a position on it, but I think that this debate shows that e-sport is a great thing in Denmark for children and young people, also for adults. It's a big thing in the world. And no matter what you think about e-sports in relation to physical sports etc. This is something that has come to stay, and I may well be afraid that, like the social media, we are running a little late in dealing with it politically; we are not acting politically where we are for or against it; I do not think we are going anywhere but are going to deal politically with whether this is an area that has become so large that there is also a need for political involvement to some extent, i.e. in economic terms, but also in terms of regulation. I also understand that this is in fact what is being demanded, perhaps precisely because this is a huge commercial market, which means that some regulation is also needed, so that when you go in and practice sports, you also know that it is on equal terms and that there are standards and rules that are being respected. If you have children who spend a lot of time on gaming, you also know that there are rules. It's a safe room. That is why I would like to say at least that we would very much like to continue working on this. I also openly admit that I do not know much about e-sports, but perhaps we are very many adults who do not really do, so we do not know enough about it here, and therefore should spend some more time acquiring some knowledge and also finding out whether there is a need for political commitment, organisation, regulation, and whether we can bring together some of the important players to advise us in relation to it. In the old e-sports panel there were mainly players from e-sports, i.e. the wide e-sport, e-sport, those who provide games, etc. If you had to set up a new panel, I also think it might be interesting to bring some with a little child and youth skills; a little like, when we look at social media and the use of them, so that we could get the professional skills on board, so that it is not just about how we become the best in the world for e-sports, but also about how we get it in a way that parents can safely leave their children on board and play for hours, because that does not harm them. I don't think children do that in general. I often think I get studies that say: it is not necessarily harmful to spend a lot of hours in front of a screen. It may be such an adult prejudice to believe it, but it would be really wonderful if, as an adult and parent, you knew that some politicians made sure it wasn't, so that politicians are involved in setting the rules and creating the standards that make it a safe space to let your children be a part of.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172927	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Stén Knuth. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420172928	Thank you to the rapporteur and, first of all, thank you for being honest about this e-sport thing. Well, three or four years ago, I didn't know much about this either. But I have stuck my nose in it and think that some of the potentials that have been mentioned here are quite right, and it is exciting to dive into. The rapporteur spoke about this with the fore and against, and of course we can spend a lot of time talking about it in here, but it's just running out there. I mean, it's just going really fast, and the rapporteur also said that we're gonna be late. It's like technology understanding in primary school, you know, that train just drives too. We have some young people who are way ahead of a number of teachers. At least there are many teachers who think that they are standing a little on the platform and have not really been able to keep up because this is going so fast. And it is going very fast, and it is also very difficult, and that is why we also need a strategy, and we also need to invite in some of the parties mentioned by the rapporteur, also in relation to the primary school, which is already in the process of doing so, and to get some experience into it, and also research. There is, in fact, a great deal of research which must also be invited in, and that was one of the things the rapporteur mentioned. Thank you so much for your speech.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173043	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173045	You're welcome for that line. I also look forward to cooperation and, as I said, I think it has been a really interesting debate, perhaps especially for us who know at least about this area; how big it is and how much there may be to gain from our political commitment to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173112	There are no follow-up questions, so we thank the rapporteur very much. And welcome to the next rapporteur, Mai Mercado, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173137	Thank you, President. Should Denmark have a new e-sport strategy? Yes, of course we do, and for a number of obvious reasons. Firstly, because the proportion of e-sporters is increasing. And yes, as the SF rapporteur has rightly said, it has come to stay. I must be honest and say that I have also had a different approach to e-sport than I have today. I think that for me it was the meeting with it and to experience for yourself how it is practiced, which ended up making the difference. I have a son who recently started playing Fortnite, and he loves it. He plays with his classmates, typically it is in the afternoon, perhaps a 20-minute time, and it is, admitted, a new world for me as a mother to embrace, and not just embrace it, but actually welcome that he plays, and even welcome that communities today are not necessarily only physical, but can also be online. So does it take time from the communities? Some would argue that, but for example, a LAN party on a Friday night is probably something that is most likely to compete with watching a movie. 41% of the boys aged 16-20 years are engaged in e-sports. And it's too big a group to ignore it that way. That is why it should also have its own strategy, its own framework. To this end, a strategy could provide the organisational framework for e-sport, which is lacking today, as several have given examples of. Today it is very loosely organized because it is so new a sport, so the setup is still immature, but it is just getting started and also get started faster than what we heard from the government. And it has to be said that not so much has happened over the last two years. In other words, when right is right, the government could not even answer Radicale's question about what happened to the panel that was supposed to make recommendations. E-sport is also strongly increasing as a growth area and with a very great potential, and that is actually something I only recently discovered. There are more than 3 billion gamers and 500 million viewers in the world who follow the big tournaments. And then you can just take the whole entourage industry in relation to gaming. But let's just stick to the tournaments. Very few know that Denmark is leading the tournaments. Well, there are a lot of people who know Astralis, and I don't think you'll find a Dane who's not really proud of the Astralis team, and we know we're doing well in Counter Strike. But most people don't know that a lot of the tournaments Broadcastes from Brøndby. We are the world leader in tournaments, and we are not exploiting that potential at all. So a few weeks ago, I visited Blast in Brøndby, and I just have to tell you honestly that I was blown behind by what they're already doing and the potential they have. And the last thing they said to me before I walked out the door was that there is a need for national teams to bring all the different stakeholders together in the same room and to develop e-sports. I do not know if we have made so much progress today. I think it has been very good that the various considerations have been made. I had hoped for a clearer statement from the Social Democratic Party, where the government cannot even answer whether chess is a sport. And then I just want to say that, in relation to whether chess can't be described as a sport, it has to be said that if thought sports aren't part of what we call sport, then it becomes a very, very narrow concept of movement that we have. I also think we have come up with some interesting considerations about loss of movement, which are obvious and very legitimate to discuss when it comes to gaming and e-sports, but which one would never even discuss if it were about chess. There we would never say: Hey, do chess players just remember to move when they play all that chess and are so interested in it? So I think that this debate shows that even the political debate in Denmark is still immature, a little like e-sport is still immature and needs this organizational framework. So thank you to the Left for a very good resolution. From here, Conservatives are in favour of it and will vote in favour of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173611	Thank you. There is one brief comment. Sir. Stén Knuth, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173613	Thank you and thank the rapporteur for the very, very fine speech and commitment to trying to find out what we are dealing with. The rapporteur also spoke about communities, and I would like to fully admit to the rapporteur that these are also new communities, where people meet and are in communities across the world, where they learn to communicate; where they learn languages. The two boys I have at home came out of their rooms after playing e-sports for 3 years, and they knew some English. I thought where the hell did they learn that from? So it can do something. It can do something in terms of execution and cooperation and focus, everything that companies otherwise demand, whether you go to e-sport or you go to football. This is also why several companies employ people on the basis of having seen them sit and play together because they can see who can focus, who can collaborate and who can execute. So it's really exciting. Just a few comments on that from the rapporteur. The last thing is compared to chess and addiction and something like that. Yes, you spend many hours on it, but the best footballers spend a lot of time training. So, are they addicted to it, too, or? It's just for reflection.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173734	Thank you. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173734-2	I think, as another rapporteur said from up here, that once you dive into it, you find that this debate and this area has many more nuances. It's a very, very caricatured picture if you think that e-sport is something going on in a basement with a Coke next door and a bag of chips on the other side. It's a lot more than that. And I believe, as the rapporteur said, that we must create healthy communities to ensure the organizational framework and to have a community to which we can return, where we can discuss, for example, how to talk to each other; how to ensure the good tone, etc. Then you can just say in relation to the whole discussion about loss of movement or not that it is ultimately a parental responsibility to ensure that your children also move. At least that's one of the things I remember as a mother.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173828	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Dennis Flydtkjær, Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420173839	Thank you. After all, the resolution is about requiring the government to draw up a revised strategy for e-sport. One cannot escape the fact that e-sport is something that grows quite strongly in these years. A lot of young people play a lot of computer, my own children included, and I have done it myself in my younger years, but don't do it much more. So e-sport is something that grows really strongly, and it is actually really positive, because it has a lot of young people in a different way than the way you can say that the old association life has got hold of them so that football or handball or other things. So it catches some people you don't get otherwise. We also see that there are associations out there that bloom up and take care of e-sports. The municipalities support it, and there are huge tournaments. There's LAN parties around here I had one for my oldest boy's class at Easter. By the way, I have a family member on my wife's side who is a professional gamer in the United States, so I know the business it's about. It is also quite well described in the motion for a resolution, so praise to the Left for it. It is quite clear that Denmark is the leader in this area already now, but when things are going so well, I cannot avoid asking the question: what is the real need for a state strategy? If we're already leading, why is it that the state has to interfere with this? If it already works so well with the free initiative that we are actually the world's leader in e-sports and we already have the Counter-Strike team Astralis, which is one of the leading ones, without having a state strategy. What's the need we're trying to cover with this? I think it's a little hard to see. After all, we do not have a national strategy for padeltennis or for badminton or for football. It is, among other things. Because it works super well out there. We have a free initiative, a massive volunteer, some good organisations handling this. Yes, I understand that this is a new sport that may have some challenges in getting organized right from the start, but is it even the state that has to take over and control it? In fact, I do not think that is the answer to that. Another focus of the proposal, which I think is very positive, is that a number of challenges need to be addressed, including how to protect minors from, for example. Advertisements like there are in the games. It may be lootboxes in these random games, which can give an entrance to later gambling problems, gambling addiction and other things, but these are actually things we have dealt with politically in the same way in the tax sector, on which I am also rapporteur. There we have made several agreements where we have actually looked at just games, i.e. video games with lootboxes and other things, to find out what it can have in the future. So I agree with that part of the resolution. But there's already a look at that. Then I just have such a general, general view at the end. I therefore believe that, as politicians, we sometimes have to stop thinking that every time there is a problem in society, we have to solve it. This problem is not a problem. It's going super well out there. You can also turn it around and say that if you see a potential in an industry that is going super well, should we interfere today as parliament politicians or put the state on it? I think sometimes you just have to let things run out there when it works well and this storms out. The motion for a resolution itself writes several times: we are the world leader in this area. What, then, is the huge urgent need for us to put down the nasty hand of the state over this? It's going really well already. So in the Danish People's Party we cannot support the resolution, but we are very happy about the things that are happening on the e-sport front. It's going well out there, and the Danes are happy about it. The young people take it in. It has a large degree of organization out there. Yeah, it's new, and there are a lot of things that need to fall into place, but the state now needs to start looking at this, I don't think it's the way forward. That's it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174235	Thank you. Mr President, there is one brief comment. Stén Knuth, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174237	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. The need for the rapporteur's speech is wrong. I mean, it's not about controlling, it's not about the state putting its nasty hand on it. This is about the fact that there is an area where so much is going on in relation to education, in relation to vulnerable young people, in relation to commercial, and how we can help to support that we also get all the potential that is in this area out of it. How can we support it? It is not about how we are to manage it, but about how we can support it. The rapporteur himself talks a little about democracy and how we catch young people and something like that. Well, there are also studies in this area that show that you bring 100 young people into an association to play e-sport, so half of them haven't been in an association before. So there are some young people out there who are not part of the community of the community on which Denmark rests. So, the huge cornerstone of the Danish model is that we have been through associations, democracy, understanding, cooperation and all that, and half of the young people who are caught in here have never been a part of it. Can the rapporteur not give it a reflection or comment?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174351	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174353	In fact, I do not think I have misunderstood the resolution. If you read what you have written from the Left, you will see that you write that you could create a gamer education, that is, a state education: it is probably the state that interferes with it. It is said that Team Denmark must be supported, which is something the state provides; it is probably the state that interferes with it. Today, a large part of society is regulated in the municipalities. That is where the support is given, for example. can have rooms, hold tournaments or other things, and that is already happening. I'm quite comfortable with the fact that we're also getting this on the distribution law. That's such a pretty decentralized way to do it. If they are allowed to get some money, they can control it themselves. It is something else that has been set up with this; there it is, after all, the state that has to put together a strategy, must unite the players, must try to support and find potentials and such things in an industry that is running out there. Well, we have huge international success in this area. I have a family member of my own who on Twitter has far more followers than Christian Eriksen. Well, he can't walk the streets of Los Angeles because he's so famous. I don't think many Danes know him, but it's something else. Well, this is gonna burst out there, and there really is no need for government involvement. There may be a need for a lot of involvement around the local area, but not by the state.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174506	Mr President, there is one more brief point I should like to make. Stén Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174507	Thank you for that, President. And thank the rapporteur for his answer. I mean, distribution means are also management, it's just called something else. This isn't about managing, it's about supporting, and we need to support all the teaching going on out in our primary school, about how we could get something more out of it, so that the young people get the skills that we talked about before, with them focusing, language, collaboration, and what can be. In terms of innovation, companies and startups, how can we help to support those companies that will be able to live even better in the future and create jobs and tax revenues for Denmark? How can we support it? That is what the proposal is about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174551	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174553	Then it's probably a little more a question of what you think is the way forward here. I am actually also surprised that the Left, as a bourgeois party, thinks that it is, like the state, that should be a rope-holder in this area, and then you have the left, in this case along with the Social Democracy, which is typically those who think that the state should control things. Here the roles have been reversed, so this is the Social Democrats who think it must be the private initiative, while the Left thinks it must be the government. I mean, I think that there are obviously potentials for business, but they can see them for themselves; there doesn't have to be a parliamentary debate about that and a state body that will then tell them about it. I think they can see them already.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174631	We thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420174640	Ah, I love it when it's topics that I actually know a lot about, and it's too bad that I only have 5 minutes to talk about it, because I love e-sports, and I have also played very much myself, of course only at hobby level, but I was there from the beginning. It wasn't competitive, but when you sat on the LAN cafes. So we sat there eating chips and drinking Coke while playing. It was really nice. It came from the fact that there were only four on each team... the first version came in 2003, I think it was to get crosshair and sniper with us. That was big. Then came the last change, it was probably 10 years ago when you went to the CS:GO, as it is now called. Sometimes you can regret it, because what couldn't have happened to me if I had just used it a little more seriously back then at the cafes. But it's amazing to see. Now it's many others who play, and it's also great to see the different games. Asia has their own games. It's some other games running over there. Now the FIFA games have come along well. We have some of the best players in the world. There is a young Dane who is absolutely fantastic and who lays down the world elite. So you can only get a smile on your lip when you hear and see how things are going out there. Then there's the question of a national strategy and things like that. I feel a little bit like we really have to be careful that we don't politicize this. Then it may well be that it will be such a discussion about concepts, about managing versus supporting. There I would say that my experience after 3 years in here is that when politicians say "support," they really mean to manage it. In that case, it is often the case that there is a political direction in that direction. And that's what politicians do. Perhaps that is what you are here for, in other words, to influence society in the direction that you think is right. But sometimes you could just look at it and say that the industry might go that way and in the direction that is good for the industry, and perhaps you should have confidence that the people who have been out there actually think of the well-being of children and young people, because I think they do. I think they are very aware of that. I also believe that we see the development that parents are beginning to become much more aware of the social situation. I think that the next generation will have it playing in a completely different way. This is everything from e-sport to e.g. Roblox, which also turns into a game. I have a five-year-old daughter who robloxes, and now they start communicating and playing. It used to be a very physical game with Barbies, and now it's just digital in those universes. I believe that we can quite clearly see an interconnection and fusion between the digital and the physical in e-sports. I believe, and we must then see that we are going to see a fusion of events and organisers, where we have the e-sport element at the same time as the physical element, where they run in parallel and start to build each other up, so that they are good for both the physical part of the sports world and the electronic part of the sports world. I think they can do something together. I fear that there will be political governance. I understand the intentions of asking whether we can do anything to ensure that entrepreneurs can get this thing going better. But when we start politically, it has become something like the job centres, and I do not think they are the great experts, etc. In fact, I believe that business itself is looking there. I think business can if we give them space and space. And I think that this industry is a good and clear example of something being a huge success, perhaps precisely because we do not have a political interference with the ideology that each of us brings into it. So while I understand the intentions of this and I love e-sport and want it to be even bigger and even better, and I think it will be, I do not think that the right way is to get even more political control of it, because I understand the intentions, but my experience is that when you want to support something, you come instead of controlling it from in here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175100	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Stén Knuth, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175103	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur. Maybe you should've stuck to that e-sport you were doing. Well, we just don't agree, and that's the way it is. However, the rapporteur could, of course, make a few comments on how we are helping this in relation to some of the challenges that the Minister is addressing. Well, it's the upbringing in relation to being online, that is, the language. Now you can't generalize, but there are many girls who feel offended, even when playing e-sports or gamer. What about match fixing? So, how does the rapporteur see us solving the challenges that are also there? In other words, the legal contracts offered to some of the young people are completely insane. Is that something we should get involved in then?
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175204	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175205	In good Jysk things aren't quite so bad in here in the Danish Parliament either. I think I'm trying to do my job well in here. I think we share the joy of e-sport and the desire that things go well. That's how far we agree. Then it's more about what tools. As far as these points are concerned, I think these are relevant points, because they are the economic aspect, the legal aspect, the legal aspect of the conclusion of contracts and all the other elements that exist. I think that the organizations responsible for these matters will also discuss this. As far as online education is concerned, I hope the parents are starting to get on the ground more. In the physical world, you will never ever allow your child at 6 or 7 years old to be a place where you didn't know who they were with or what they were doing there. There you'll have some control over where they are. And I kind of miss the parents being able to handle it when it's in the electronic world too. It is, of course, a generalisation, but one hears that that is what is sometimes not enough of.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175312	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. We thank the rapporteur and then it is the rapporteur for the authors of the motion, Mr Stén Knuth, the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175344	Thank you very much for that, and thank you very much for the debate and the initiatives that have been taken, for the support and also for those who do not support it. I hope, of course, that we will be able to change that in our committee or in the bilateral meetings that we will have here in the wake of it. I have visited clubs, I have visited schools, I have visited exposed in Randers, where you use this e-sport to catch the young people in. In other words, 800,000 young people every day use this e-sport or gaming at different levels, so it has young people, and if it has young people, we think there should be a strategy for it, also because, as several rapporteurs have said, what several rapporteurs have said is a lot both in relation to schools, clubs, associations, commercial and research. There's so much going on here that somehow we think there should be a national strategy in relation to how we can help support it, whether that's what's going on in primary school, or that's what's going on in commercial or something else, so get this area together for a talk about what's of potential, so that we also get smarter. Well, we have had rapporteurs on the platform today, who for the first time say "e-sport" or "gaming," so there is a need for us, as politicians, to be dressed in relation to what it really is, and it can do a great deal, and it is not enough that we stand here and say that we recognise it and that everything will be fine if we just leave it alone. But we believe that there needs to be a strategy on where we want to go with this, how we want to support getting some young healthy people through a school system or some youth education where you can use e-sports or gaming, and also some commercial companies that can grow from this, even though there are some really big companies out there today that are making a lot of money. But they also make some events and are doing something that the shore is also looking for, which is really, really exciting. I believe in e-sports. It was SF's mantra, and so I believe, and thank you very much for your cooperation with the SF's rapporteur, and we will continue to do so. I am very much looking forward to the further work in committee and, of course, I hope that we can either agree that we will vote for it and that there is a majority in favour of it, or that we will draw up a report which will also provide a direction for further work on e-sports and gaming and all that lies in it, both in the voluntary, commercial, educational and research fields. Because there is a need for us to learn a little bit more about this and that we are not only saying that we recognise it, but that we are also trying to figure out how much we can get out of the potential of e-sport and gaming, and that of course we are also getting hold of some of the challenges that everyone has mentioned here today and which I will not repeat again. But thank you very much for the debate. This will not be the last time we hear about e-sports and gaming and everything else that it can from this platform. I will as the last promise. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175722	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Charlotte Broman Mølbæk, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175725	Thank you for that, and this might be a bit unorthodox. However, in the heat of commitment, I forgot to receive a greeting from the Enhedslisten and to say that they welcome e-sport, the motion for a resolution and a possible report. Well, I guess that's what I'm saying. Then I'd like to sign up again for the good cooperation with Mr. Knox. Stén Knuth and to the Left in relation to the e-sport. And I would also like to ask whether the rapporteur would like to unfold a little more, where he would like e-sports to go and what could come out of such a strategy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175802	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175803	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur for the roses. I also think that it worked a lot at first, and then we had a hearing where I really thought it was a little clearer what we were doing and how we could rubricate the stakes or the way we support this area. Well, I see quite clearly that there is something within the entire primary school that is already well under way. What are they doing, and what do they get out of it? It could be really nice to look at the potentials, but also the challenges there. Something is going on in the field of research, which we must also have uncovered in some way. What are they doing? What are they gonna find out? How can we use it in the future? In the whole area of exposure, I have also mentioned the fact that, among other things, we are dealing with a number of issues. in Randers has something really exciting going on with children who haven't been to school for several years, and then they get them in via e-sport and get them a graduation exam. What's it capable of? Of course, there is the whole commercial business, which is both about the really talented and the team games we have, such as "Stratis" and "Tricked", but of course also "Blast" and some of the companies that live on this and which create a lot of jobs and tax dollars for Denmark. This is how the four balls I think I can see there could be in a strategy that we should work for and support.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175928	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420175929	Thank you. It sounds really exciting, and I am of course very pleased that the rapporteur also mentions Randers Special School, since I live in Randers and know them quite well. But I also think it is a really important point that when we talk about pitfalls and challenges, we also see inclusion in e-sports that you do not see so many other places, so people with disabilities can play on an equal footing with everyone else, and that they can actually use some of the other resources and competences they have. So I see absolutely the potential in that too. But once again, thank you very much for the resolution and for the debate and the cooperation that I am sure you and I will continue to do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420180009	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420180011	Thank you. I fully agree with the inclusion issue. After all, I have been visiting a company which has students, in other words pupils in these specially designed upper secondary schools, where they take in five young people who have hardly any language or who do not know this with cooperation and community. And when these five young people sit and play, they see that they are actually in the same game, and then they start puffing each other and talking to each other, and these are things they hadn't done before. So yes, this e-sport and e-gaming can really, very much, also in terms of inclusion. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
ParlaMint-DK_20220420180045	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the draft parliamentary resolution be referred to the Committee on Culture. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220420180102	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Thursday 21 April 2022, at 12.00 p.m. 10:00. I refer to the agenda that will appear on the Danish Parliament's website.
