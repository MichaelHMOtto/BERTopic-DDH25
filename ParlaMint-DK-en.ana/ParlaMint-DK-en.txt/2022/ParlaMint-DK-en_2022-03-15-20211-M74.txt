ParlaMint-DK_20220315131432	The debate is open. Sir. Rasmus Stoklund, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131451	Thank you. With this urgent legislative proposal, it is proposed to secure the basis of residence for Ukrainian refugees. Unfortunately, as you know, many Ukrainians have had to flee their homeland as a result of Russia's declared war on Ukraine. In short, the bill must ensure the legal basis for Ukrainian refugees to quickly become part of Danish society. In the Social Democratic Party we believe that Denmark should of course welcome refugees from Ukraine with open arms. That is why we are pleased that a broad majority in this Parliament will ensure that Ukrainian refugees do not have to pass through the ordinary asylum system, a system that would come under unnecessary, great pressure if many thousands of Ukrainians arrived in a short space of time. It would also be unnecessary pressure on the system because the war is a condition. There is no doubt that many Ukrainian women and children will need protection while the men fight against Putin's troops. The temporary protection directive has been activated in the European Union and, because of Denmark's legal reservation, we are not covered by it. That is why we met in a broad circle of parties to draw up a special law which is close to what the other EU countries are doing. On the Danish side, we are doing the same for Ukrainians as for the rest of the European Union. Unfortunately, there are some, both highly politically left-wing groups and foreigners, who have been busy making the special law a matter of discrimination and racism. But the Danes are not a racist people because they want to help neighbors in need, and if you think that Denmark, under the special law, discriminates against refugees from Syria and acts racistly, you have to think the same thing about the EU's other Member States. Finally, I would like to remind you that we did the same for Muslims from Kosovo. In 1999, the Folketing adopted a similar special law to help Muslim Kosovo Albanians who were fleeing Serbia's Slobodan Milošević. We would not have adopted a special law if only a few thousand Ukrainians were on the run in Europe. The European asylum systems would run the risk of collapse if everyone were to be treated individually. Ukrainians are Europeans and Ukraine is part of Europe, and that is why we in Denmark have a special obligation to house Ukrainian refugees. This is our immediate area, and in the social democracy we have been arguing for years that refugees should be helped in their immediate neighbourhoods. At the same time, it is essential that an EU as a whole shows Russia that we are on Ukraine's side. Unfortunately, Russia does not want the free world any good, so we must therefore stick together in the free world. With the law we ensure that Ukrainians can quickly establish themselves in Denmark and get to school or work. Hopefully, the bill will be adopted tomorrow so that it can come into force from Thursday. Social democracy supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131725	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are brief comments. First, it's sir. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131730	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to the rapporteur, whom I do not think is giving a very fair picture of this bill, since of course he is right to talk about the Ukrainians who unfortunately have to leave their country, but perhaps, as an oratorial act, choose to skip over what was behind the fact that it is not 179 members of the Folketing who are going to vote for it here, namely that the government insists that not only the Syrians and Afghans, etc. who may be in Ukraine, but also their families, who may be outside Ukraine, should be subject to the same law. Does the rapporteur not think that this approach is contrary to the words of the Prime Minister that it is the Government's, and hence the rapporteur's, ambition to bring Denmark together, to bring the Danish Parliament together, when it insists on progress with a legislative proposal containing these two very different groups?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131832	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131834	No, I don't think so. The group, which is primarily concerned with this bill, is Ukrainian citizens who need protection. Then there are a small number of people who have been granted asylum in Ukraine in recent years; according to the UN, it is about 2,300 people involved. The 2,300 people will then also flee Ukraine, one must assume, like many Ukrainians, and they will then travel to different European countries. And if there were to come what do I know about 10 or 20 or 30 of them to Denmark, then I do not think it is something that in any way overturns Danish asylum policy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131912	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131913	No, but what if it was thousands? So now, the rapporteur says that this is 2,274 I think the exact figure is • but what I can read in the government's bill here is that § 2 also includes a number of other preliminaries associated with the Syrians and Afghans who may have been granted refugee status and that paragraph 4 paragraph 4 paragraph 4 states: 2 doesn't even have to be in Ukraine or in Denmark in order to get a residence permit in Denmark under this law. So if you look at how many people are actually included in the group that is not Ukrainian citizens, how many are they, rapporteur?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131950	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315131952	Well, according to the United Nations, it is about 2,300 people involved, and that is an estimate by the United Nations. In addition, there are many others who have a basis for residence in Ukraine but who are not personally persecuted in their home countries or where there is no war in their home countries and who can therefore go to their own home countries. That is why, according to the UN estimate, it is a question of some 2,300 people travelling to different EU Member States, and I do not think that the 2,300 people are going to be an overload for Denmark when you go along with us getting some of them. Whether it be 10, 20, 30 or 40, none of us can know. The 2,300 is also only a UN estimate, but I do not think there is anything in what says that this should in any way be a great burden for Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132036	Then it's Victoria Velasquez, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132042	Thank you. We have witnessed before that Ukrainian citizens have been exploited by employers for social dumping, and this is particularly relevant in a situation where people fleeing war risk being exposed to the exploitation of employers. I would therefore like to ask the rapporteur what terms and conditions of employment the rapporteur considers should apply to the Ukrainians concerned under the special law, and whether the rapporteur believes that we should ensure that the people fleeing from war are not subsequently, when they come to Denmark, severely exploited in relation to their labour force. Does the rapporteur think that we must ensure and guarantee that they must, of course, work on an equal footing with other Danes with the usual pay and working conditions?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132132	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132134	I do not think that anyone should be exploited in Denmark or treated badly on the Danish labour market, regardless of where they come from in the world. And I do not think that they should do so for their own sake, because it would be unfair to them, but I do not think it is for the sake of the Danish employees either, because it would also undermine the Danish labour market. And the conditions here are, of course, that Ukrainians who come here under the special law will be subject to the other integration legislation, and if they do not get into work themselves, they will organise some kind of programme for them, where they will try to get them into work and they will get Danish education etc., and then it is clear that it must be on fixed terms like all possible other places. There, we in the Danish Parliament have also tightened the penalties for people who use foreign labour in various ways.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132218	Victoria Velasquez.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132220	But that is not the case here. The case is that we have a special law where you grant work permits right away. We think it is a good idea but without any demands being made to employers at all. There is no protection in relation to their pay and working conditions. There is no guarantee that they will know that they will not be exploited, that they will not be mistreated. So what would the rapporteur think we should do to ensure that the people fleeing war do not come here afterwards and then be exploited?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132250	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132252	Well, in Denmark we have the Danish model, and there are the social partners who regulate the labour market to a large extent, and that is also where the organisation of jobs, etc. is ensured. and ensure that there are no unfair working conditions. And that is not something to be written into all legislation that is adopted, not even in the field of foreigners, that is, how the Danish labour market should be linked. Of course, I think that people should be treated properly, and when you get into this special law, you get an integration programme, and then you have to go to a workplace. Of course, if you are treated badly there, you should contact the trade union or the authorities, depending on how serious it may be, and then, of course, you have to take action against it. But that is not all that needs to be regulated by legislation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132331	Sir. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132334	Thank you for the floor, President, and thank you to the rapporteur. The rapporteur mentioned some parties who believe that this is discrimination and discrimination. Free Greens are one of the parties that believes that this special law means discrimination. Because, on the one hand, when you say to some refugees that they have one set of rules and, on the other hand, you say to other refugees that they have a different set of rules, it is discrimination, whether you support it or not. But it is not at all the case that, as the rapporteur says, we also believe that the Danish people are racist. It is the legislation that is discriminatory and racist. However, I have a question for the rapporteur. The main argument for the parties supporting the proposal has been that it is, after all, because Ukraine is a neighbouring area. It was also in the party leader's debate. That is why I would like the Socialist rapporteur to define it and to say what the Socialists mean when they say 'neighbourhood'. Can the rapporteur define proximity?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132434	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132435	Yes, first of all, I think it is wrong to say that this is discrimination. I mean, there's nothing wrong with discrimination. The problem is if there is unbiased discrimination, i.e. if, for example, we do not have the right to vote in local elections. tells a red-haired Ukrainian that they receive one treatment while a brown-haired Ukrainian is treated differently. That would be discrimination. That would be wrong and unspeakable. But the fact that different nationalities have different conditions in Denmark is completely normal, and so it is with all possible conditions. If an American came to Denmark, he could not avail himself of the freedom of movement of the European Union. A Swede who came to Denmark could do that. There are special conditions for Nordic citizens in relation to obtaining citizenship. It is also entirely legitimate. In this way there is completely legitimate discrimination in all possible ways, both in relation to other nationalities and also in relation to people here. There are, for example: the discrimination that not everyone can demand to come in and sit on Mr. Sikandar Siddique's seat right now, but Mr. Sikandar Siddique may demand to enter and sit on it because he has a mandate that makes him entitled to do so. This discrimination is entirely legitimate. There is no problem with this type of discrimination.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132538	Sir. Sikandar Siddique, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132540	I shall now answer it and at the same time ask my question again. Can the rapporteur define a proximity area? That was the question, and there was no answer at all to that. Is Istanbul also a neighborhood? Is it the distance that determines it, or what? We would like an answer to that. Then I would like to say that it is precisely discrimination when it is said that Ukrainians with citizenship and these 2,400 with refugee status can get across, while the rules do not apply to everyone else who is down there, in the same place and who is also experiencing bombs. That is discrimination.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132613	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132615	Well, of course I am happy to answer questions, but when the rapporteur insists on saying wrong things, I have to comment on that too. In my world, our natural neighbourhood is Europe, that is what I see as our immediate area of Europe. Since the Second World War, there has not been a long tradition of war breaking out all the time or major disasters occurring around Europe's territory. Fortunately, this is very rare. But that has now happened in Ukraine, and that is our immediate area. If a war should arise again in Europe in the future, I would also say, as a starting point, that this is our immediate area, but otherwise it will have to take a position on it at any time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132653	Mrs. Rosa Lund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132655	Thank you for that and thank you for your speech, sir. Rasmus Stoklund, whom I do not think answered one very central question, namely the question of how it might be that the Aliens Act is good enough for people fleeing Assad and people fleeing the Taliban, but not for people fleeing Putin and for whom we are now making a special law. Well, isn't it as serious to be on the run from Assad's bombs as being on the run from Putin's?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132725	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132726	I actually think I replied to it myself, but I should like to repeat it. So, the reason why this temporary protection directive is being applied throughout the European Union and we are adopting a special law that is in line with that directive is that it is now several million people who come out in the Member States of the European Union, including Denmark, within a few weeks and months. When the Syrians came to Denmark, they came over several years, it was not as acute a situation as many of them came from refugee camps as they had lived for several years, and it was not several million who came in a few weeks or a few months, and therefore there was no need to make this kind of special legislation or activate the temporary protection directive. After all, it is simply a question of the EU's asylum systems crashing if they suddenly had to deal with two and perhaps several million people in a matter of weeks or months. That is, of course, the short answer to why the European Union is now taking special measures in a group of countries, just as was done, since in 1999 it was Muslim Kosovars who were driven on the run by Milosevic.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132828	Mrs. Rosa Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132829	But sir... Rasmus Stoklund does not see at all that there is a problem with our alien law when it is so tight that even people fleeing Putin can not be protected by the way we stay in Denmark that we have to make a special law to give these people protection? I think it exhibits how flawed our immigration legislation is and how bad we are at providing protection to people who are fleeing, that we have to make this special law. I really think it exhibits the policy of social democracy in the ugliest way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132902	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132904	In a way, I agree, but this is probably from a slightly different point of view from what Mrs Lund is proposing here. For the reason that I believe that this shows that the asylum system does not work is that our asylum systems in the European Union are being forced every year to spend huge amounts of resources on people who do not need asylum but who, on the way to Europe, have come to throw their papers in the water or to abandon their passports and therefore cannot prove who they are and may also say that they are going to go somewhere other than where they really come from. And then the EU's asylum systems, including Denmark's incredible amount of resources, are spending on finding out who they are.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132940	Sir. Christian Lund, no, sorry, sir. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315132944	Yes, sir. Christian Lund is no longer here. I would like to say that it is good and important that we help the Ukrainians, who have to flee in this terrible situation where Putin is going completely crazy, quite brutally. But the funding screams to heaven. I am now in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and I do not understand why we have not even been involved in the financing. We're the ones who have to pay the full bill if we're gonna follow this. You take 2.1 billion. kr. from development aid, from the world's poorest, and spends it on refugees. However, we have done a pandemic bypassing the budget law. And we've made it, or at least some are making a national compromise of 18 billion. kr. a year, which is partly financed by loans. Would it not be best to use the money from the national compromise to fund it here instead of stealing it from the world's poorest people, which we need to do when we need to reduce development aid?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133045	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133047	As far as the money from the national compromise is concerned, it is well known that the Enhedslisten is located elsewhere than many others when it comes to making our contribution to defending Denmark against, among other things, Denmark. Russia. But I think it is quite natural to use development aid to help people in need, also to help people in need in Denmark, and there is nothing new in it. In other words, one might almost get the impression that this was such a mechanism that was invented for the occasion, but there is nothing new in the fact that this is the way to fund interventions for refugees, and I am sure the rapporteur is also aware of this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133122	Christian Juhl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133124	Well, there's something completely new in this. On the basis of the bourgeois government, we have a scheme taken over by this government with a pool of development aid under section 06.3. which can be used in such a situation. It says 300 million. kr. This time you take a lot, much more than it says in that pool. You take 2.1 billion. kr. from development aid • 2.1 billion. kr.! This has never happened before, and it has even been done over the head of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; we were not even invited to the technical review.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133158	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133200	Since there was a large stream of refugees in 2015 and 2016 from Syria, the same method of funding was used, and this has been the case in a number of cases. There's nothing new in this. And Enhedslisten could have problematized it at an earlier stage if you thought this system should be completely changed in connection with this special law, but it hasn't been up, because that wasn't what this special law was about. This special law is about helping Ukrainians, and I know it has not been a question of the special law being about creating development aid in a new way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133233	Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133235	Thank you so much. The rapporteur's answer leads very well to my question because, as has also been said earlier, this law does not just include Ukrainian citizens. It also includes people mainly from the Middle East and North Africa, who have been granted asylum in Ukraine, and I would just like to hear from the rapporteur why they should be subject to a special law to help Ukrainians, so a special law, because in fact we all want to help Ukrainians. But why do they have to come under that special law when, in principle, they can simply go to another country and seek asylum under exactly the same conditions as when they applied to Ukraine?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133314	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133316	I think that is a reasonable principle. Because if you have fled from a country where you were in danger and Ukraine and you have been granted asylum in Ukraine, but now you cannot stay there because Putin is throwing bombs in your head, you need a new place to be, but because of the asylum status you have, you cannot go to your country of origin, which I think you should have done otherwise, but you cannot do so when you have asylum from your country of origin. So I think it is natural to leave with the Ukrainians who are now going out into Europe, and it is several million Ukrainians who are going out into Europe, and according to the United Nations, it is these almost 2,400 people with asylum status who are going out into Europe, and it is in fact not just Denmark, it is to the whole of the European Union.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133405	Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133407	2.274 I think the exact number is, but I just have to ask it again. They have every opportunity, that is, they have applied for asylum before and received it, they can in fact simply seek asylum in another country. Why is it that this group should also be included when, in fact, we in the Folketing would like to adopt a law that guarantees Ukrainian citizens who will temporarily come up here, contribute, etc. before they can then hopefully go home when there is peace in their country again? Why has there not been a law for Ukrainian citizens alone?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133444	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133445	Perhaps I do not quite catch the finesse in the question, because I think it sounds a little like the same question that I answered before. Anyway, they're approx. 2,300 refugees, estimated by the United Nations and granted asylum, have, of course, been granted asylum once, and therefore I do not see that there is a great need for us to say to Ukraine that we do not recognise their way of granting asylum, as the rest of the European Union does not say, and if there are then 20-30 people from this group, who come from different places in Central and Eastern Europe and from elsewhere in the world, and who need protection here, then I think we can do it too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133524	Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard, Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133529	Thank you. Yeah, but I'd like to get back to that area thing. There has been a hectic and heated debate, I think, in the media before this proposal was considered: what is the immediate area? And that's debatable, but we can't get to the core, sir. Rasmus Stoklund? After all, these are people we really want to help because they are very similar to ourselves. That is what this is all about, and that is why, I think, the Danish people have shown such great goodwill for this. Never has so much money been collected. Never before, at least not to me, has there been so much helpfulness, so many people who provide housing, so much debate around the home that Ukraine had to be helped. That's because there aren't any big problems. The 13,000 already living in Denmark are hard-working, employed. They learn Danish. There may be some, but at least not many within the social systems. Crime is remarkably low compared to people from the Middle East, Africa. That's what this is all about. Is the rapporteur not right?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133631	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133633	I would agree with Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard, as far as I also think there is something intuitively sensible about helping a friend or neighbour who has come into need, and so it is not in the same breath that we can be expected to help the rest of the world at the same time. We have been saying for years that we think refugees should be helped in their vicinity. Now it is in our vicinity that there is a conflict. That is why we have a responsibility to help people here, just as we have been saying for years that when there is a conflict in Asia or in the Middle East, it is their neighbours who have a responsibility, and then we should be happy to contribute development aid and the like to support the efforts. But I also think that looking back at the latest example of something similar, which was probably the war in Kosovo at the end of the 1990s, when the Danes also supported the special law adopted at the time, which helped Kosovo Albanians who were Muslims, it is not such a religious issue. It is a question of helping your neighbors and friends who are in need and who live in your neighborhood, and I think that makes excellent sense.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133734	Pia Kjærsgaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133735	I think it's amazing that I can't have Mr. Knox. Rasmus Stoklund to just say it as it is. Well, it may have something to do with religion, but that's not what I was talking about. What I said is that it is people who do not have the same crime and who are not under the same social system. They would very much like to learn Danish and would very much like to take the work that is being offered, for example. in agriculture. There we know that a great many Ukrainians are already, and there are likely to be more. When did we actually hear of Ukrainians • there are 13,000 in Denmark who have caused great problems? I certainly do not remember that, whereas there are plenty of Syrians and North Africans and people from the Middle East who have the opposite.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133815	Thank you. Then we'll get answers. Here you go, rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133816	There is no doubt that if you go into Danmarks Statistik and look at how the Ukrainians who are in Denmark today are doing in relation to refugees from the countries from which we have normally received refugees, then they almost score vice versa. With regard to public support, the proportion is very low. In terms of employment, the proportion is very high. It is, after all, a little opposite to some of the countries from which we have normally obtained refugees. It is certainly connected, as Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard says. Part of the reason why there's a lot of sympathy for this group is that it's a group you have good experience with, but I think it's also because the Danes think it's natural to help a neighbor who's come into need.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133854	Sir. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133856	I just think I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his cooperation on this. I think it is absolutely crucial that, in this situation, we help the many Ukrainians who are now fleeing Putin's bombs, and I think it is strong that we can stand together in this Parliament. But one of the things we do with this legislation is to give the people who come here now a much easier access to Danish society, access to the Danish labour market, the opportunity to contribute. It is not a privilege that so many other refugees have, and so I would like to hear from the rapporteur whether this does not make the Social Democratic Party reflect a little over whether one should give some of the same opportunities to other refugees who come to Denmark in terms of being integrated and contributing to Danish society right away in relation to otherwise having to sit and not really have the opportunity to become part of society when one gets here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133944	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315133946	First of all, thank you. I agree that it is important for the Folketing to stand together and make a broad agreement in such a situation. In the past, it was easier for Ukrainians to get here. In other words, Ukrainians could already come here without a visa, for example. Syrians and Afghans cannot travel visa-free into Denmark. But no, this in no way makes me think that now we have to change the law for anyone who wants to travel to Denmark. This is, of course, linked to the fact that I believe that refugees should be helped in their vicinity, and I regard Ukraine as our immediate area, whereas I do not regard Afghanistan as our immediate area. And that's why I don't think there's anything natural about this, and you can have different political views about Afghans crossing a wide range of safe countries and oceans, and what do I know before they apply for asylum in Denmark and settle down here. I think there is something natural about some people living in our neighbourhood who are fleeing from a war that threatens Europe's freedom in general because of Putin's aggression, then shelter from us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134050	Sir. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134052	If there is something that really helps in the neighbourhood, it is also Danish development aid, and now so much money is being spent precisely from development aid to finance Danish refugee reception. It is true, as the rapporteur says, that there is nothing new about this. I remember the stories of 2015, where the country in the world that received most Danish development aid was Denmark. Nevertheless, I think it is very unfair that it should be financed in this way. Could we not perhaps look at some funding for this proposal other than development aid, so that this is not going to hit the world's poorest very, very hard?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134127	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134129	As far as I remember, it's 150 million. kr. or 200 million DKK taken from other reserves. In addition, however, I think it is actually good to use development aid. Well, we're helping people who are in need and who Mr. Carl Valentin mentions that this is a mechanism we have had for years, and I think it is a sound and sensible mechanism. And until the day we get money trees with which we can finance things in Denmark, I think it makes sense to have this realism built into our way of managing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134158	Then it's Mrs. Kathrine On Saturday, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134200	Thank you. After all, somewhere we find it disconcerting that we do not have room in our current alien law to accommodate the Ukrainians, so we have to make a special law. But we have actually made a paragraph earlier when the Syrians came, which is called Section 7.3 and which is such a general safeguard clause. Why is it that this paragraph is not good enough for Ukrainians in the eyes of the Social Democrats?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134230	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134232	But now, unfortunately, I am going to repeat myself again, because this is the same question that I have been asked a few times, and the answer is that the reason why we are handling this differently across the European Union, including Denmark, is that if we dealt with it as if there were a few people, the asylum systems would come under severe pressure and risk collapse. That's the short explanation. There are several million people on their way to the EU Member States in a few weeks' time, and this is an extraordinary situation. If what was at stake was that 300 Ukrainians were on their way to Europe or to Denmark, it would not be necessary at all, because then you could just use the normal asylum system. So that's the simple answer to that question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134314	Mrs. Kathrine On Saturday.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134316	Well, let me go another way. About two and a half weeks ago, I asked the Minister what a nearby area is. It seems to be the main argument of the Social Democratic Party that help should be provided here, because here is a close area. So the point of zero asylum seekers, as the Prime Minister has said in the past, certainly does not apply to the neighbourhoods. So I asked for a definition of the outlying areas and got an answer that says: the government does not have a fixed definition of a nearby area. I can hear from the rapporteur that the rapporteur has mentioned Europe in the past, and I assume that a geographical Europe must be meant. In that definition, Ukraine is, of course, Europe and also neighbouring the European Union, and so is Turkey. So my question is this: is Turkey also a neighbouring region, because Turkey meets the same criteria as Ukraine?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134357	Thank you. Then we shall have answers from the rapporteur. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134359	However, Mrs Kathrine Olladag is probably aware that there is no war in Turkey right now, and that is why there is not a large flow of refugees on the way to Denmark from Turkey, and it is, of course, quite crucial in this context, where we have to deal with a war in one of our neighbouring countries, and that is why it is appropriate to make special legislation for Ukrainians and is not relevant to make special legislation for all sorts of others. I don't think I can get any closer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134427	Then it's mr. Henning Hylllested, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134432	I also understood from the Socialist rapporteur in her reply to Mrs Kathrine on Wednesday that a special law would not have been necessary if it were a few thousand Ukrainians who came and not, as there is a prospect, at least for the whole of Europe, millions. Does this mean that if it had been a few thousand Ukrainians, whatever it is, they should have been subject to the current asylum rules and the current immigration law, with the very, very strict rules that are, and not the more relaxed conditions that the special law expresses for the Ukrainian refugees, both in terms of easier access to the labour market, for education and for settlement in general?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134520	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134521	That is a little hypothetical, because it is something else that is a condition at the moment. I do not remember the exact number, but I believe that five or six Ukrainian asylum seekers came to Denmark last year. After all, they did not get any special legislation; they came in as asylum seekers via the asylum system like everyone else. And everyone does, no matter where in the world they come from. Now the large groups have been from the Middle East in recent years, but there have after all also been others who have applied for asylum in Denmark. They have entered the ordinary asylum system. In addition, however, it is not just Denmark that is at stake here. After all, it is the whole of the European Union that is at stake, and then it is the question of whether we should put ourselves in a different way from all other EU countries. I don't think we should. I think it makes sense for us to do what we can together now to help people here, and I also think it is quite obvious to make a special effort for your neighbour who has been in need and then, of course, live up to what you yourself have been preaching for years, namely that people need to be helped in their vicinity. Then, of course, we also have to do so when there is a conflict in our neighbourhood and that is what we are doing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134620	Sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134622	Now people are fleeing a war. And whether it is millions fleeing all over Europe or whether it is a few thousand Ukrainians fleeing, they will have fled the same war; but in that case, I can understand where it had been a few thousand, then, despite fleeing the same war as the millions who are fleeing now, they would have been subject to the strict rules that apply today to refugees coming to our country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134657	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134659	Well, in this sense, we do not have very strict rules if we actually have a need for protection. The problem is that over half of those who come every year do not have a need for protection and then they have come to misplace their passports on the journey and other things and have come to say that they come from somewhere else than they really come from etc. Then it is clear that it is a little difficult, and then you will say, when someone comes from TV 2 and wants to interview you, that you think it is extremely tight. But that is not the case; it is because there is no need for protection. These people have a need for protection, but in addition, what is being put forward is totally hypothetical.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134727	Mrs. Jette Gottlieb, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134733	Thank you. I would like to return to the question of financing these things. In other words, as the name says, development aid is intended to support and develop communities in the poorest countries. Does the rapporteur see anything offensive about the fact that the money set aside in our Finance Act for this purpose is now being used for something quite different?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134754	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134756	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134758	Mrs. Jette Gottlieb.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134800	That was a very short answer. I can elaborate on the fact that, in spite of the fact that there have been practices in this area involving a pool of 300 million. kr. Within the framework laid down in the Finance Act, we now go in and spend seven times as much money, with the result that, in this financial year, we have to cut back on quite concrete, agreed development aid funds. Is that something you just do, in other words, reprioritize in this way without having a very serious consideration and discussion?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134833	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134835	No, of course it is not something you just do, because it is tough decisions that have to be made; but it is not something that has been decided by Denmark, that is, that there should be war in Europe right now; that is, that is what is terrible. And there we have to help a lot of people, and it costs a lot of money, and it has to be financed as has been done for years, namely this way. Then there has been a discussion over the last 24 hours, which is now becoming more of a matter of principle, or at least a slightly different one, because it is not only related to this particular legislation, but is a development policy discussion which I do not really have any mandate or great prerequisites to stand and wise me on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134912	Thank you to the rapporteur. I do not think I have overlooked anyone who has asked for brief comments. So we thank Mr. Rasmus Stoklund and can now proceed in the rapporteur's line to Mr. Mads Birded, Left
ParlaMint-DK_20220315134928	Thank you for the floor. The situation in Ukraine is meaningless and terrible. For the first time in generations, we are experiencing flows of refugees, which we have not seen before internally. It is not since World War II that we have seen so many refugees moving within Europe. You get sad when you follow the horrors of war, and I am one of those who sit almost 24 hours watching the media you can now follow, to see the latest news from Ukraine, and I do not imagine that there are many bright points for the thousands of women, children and the elderly who have gone away from the men who have remained to bid Putin's defiance. Of course, we must help the Ukrainians who come to Denmark and they must have access to our labour market, our schools, our hospitals as soon as possible. We do not know how long they are going to be here, nor do we know how long there is a war down there. It is all up in the air right now, as they say, but I am glad that there is a majority in the Danish Parliament who agree on the feeling that I also feel there is in the Danish people, i.e. that you very, very much want to help and secure the agreement that is now being implemented under this special law. It ensures, among other things, that Ukrainian residents can go home and help in their efforts against Putin without losing their residence permit in Denmark. It has been important to me, and it has been important to the Left, that you should not fear for your own residence permits or your children's residence permits because you went back to make an effort. We now find that thousands of Danes help in the ways they can now, with clothes and with food, and some have them living with them. In the municipalities we see several mayors say that they are ready to help. Such support is very, very positive, and it is important that we, on the political side, support the vital efforts of local communities. Local communities must have the resources and financial resources to carry out this task. The law, for example, lays down. In order to ensure that local authorities have the greatest possible flexibility in the integration effort, a kind of sluggishness can be introduced into the system. I think that is very important. We have only seen the peak of the refugee iceberg, which accounts for the unhappy circumstances in Ukraine. The municipalities will therefore be able to postpone, at times, requirements and rules in relation to the rules of the integration law, which are in the area, and we also support that. It is a huge integration task that lies ahead, but I have no doubt that it will succeed. There's a war going on. The Left's policy on refugees has always been that we should help in the neighbourhood. It may seem easy to say sometimes when the war is going on far away, then it may also sound like an excuse that it is not here that you make an effort. But now the balloon has gone up with us; the war is raging in Europe, and that is our responsibility. It is we who are near the area; we cannot run away from that. We do not yet know how many people will flee, nor do we know where they will primarily end up. I understand from some of the talks that have been held with refugees crossing the border in Poland that there is also great uncertainty among Ukrainians themselves. But I expect many people to come to Denmark, and it is the Left's wish that we should help both those who have fled internally to neighbouring countries and those who might come here. The Special Act today is an important first step in helping the people fleeing Ukraine. But the war is evolving day by day, and we must, of course, be aware that there can be even more, and then we must help further. With these words, I can announce that the Left will vote in favour of the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135339	Thank you. Sir. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135343	I believe or I can hear that both we in the Danish People's Party and the Left fully share the desire and perception that it is of course a loving duty to help the Ukrainians, who of the unhappy circumstances we know cannot be in their country of origin. What puzzles me, and which throughout this brief debate has puzzled me about the position of the Left, and which is why I have to ask, is that, in addition to the wish to help Ukrainians who left Ukraine on 24 February or after that, which is quite fine, we will also help people who are still away in Syria or Afghanistan, for example, if they are connected with their spouses or other family who are legally resident in Ukraine. That is what follows from § 4 para. Two, here. How can it really be that an Ukrainian, for example. had to be on family visits to Poland and, therefore, not in Ukraine on 24 February, should have less help than some Arab who has not been in Ukraine for a long time but who has been fortunate enough to have a family there?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135451	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135456	One is no worse off than the other. They're all the same. If you have asylum status in Ukraine, you are also covered by these rules, and we should not overrule the status of asylum granted to groups by Ukraine. They are fleeing the same war, and they must be treated equally. In practice, the largest proportion of this group will also turn out to be Russians, and I would think it would be really strange to say to Russians who have been granted asylum in Ukraine that their asylum status no longer counts. This is a position that I can reveal that the Left is not going to stand on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135540	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135541	Well, that's just not what I'm aiming for. I understand that you want those 2,274 Syrians and Afghans, etc. can also come to Denmark, and we disagree about that. What I don't understand is that section 2 also gives collectors to Syrians and Afghans etc. access to Denmark, and pursuant to § 4 para. 2, they don't have to be in Denmark. That's what puzzles me. So, a spouse of a Syrian who has been granted asylum status in Ukraine, who is then in Syria, must also be able to come to Denmark, but the Ukrainian who happened not to be in Ukraine on 24 February cannot come to Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135619	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135621	It is the case that close relatives of both those who have asylum status in Ukraine and the Ukrainians who may flee are treated equally under the special law. That is how I understand the text of the agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135637	Thank you for the floor, President. Thank you to the rapporteur. I understand that the Left is also talking about this principle of proximity, and I also understand that our immediate area is Europe, so I would like to ask something quite specifically, because we did not get an answer to it from the Socialist rapporteur. Does this also mean that Istanbul is our immediate area? What is the definition of a nearby area? How does the Left define Denmark's immediate area, and is Istanbul also Denmark's immediate area?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135718	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135723	I actually agree with the definition that Mr. Rasmus Stoklund came along, namely that Europe is our immediate area. Then it is true that there is one country: Turkey, some of which are in Europe and some of which are outside Europe, and to the extent that war breaks out in the part that lies in the European part of Turkey or in general it has to be dealt with. This is a rather thoughtful debate, because there is no war in Turkey, but if it were the case that people fled especially from the part bordering Greece and Bulgaria, then I would also see it as our immediate area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135759	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135801	Nearby is also a thoughtful and invented concept. Would the rapporteur not confirm that the Refugee Convention does not contain the concept of "neighbourhood area"? On the other hand, Article 3 of the Refugee Convention states that all refugees must be treated equally. So I will try to ask the rapporteur again, and that is because it is so pervasive in our debate in Denmark: is it not time for us to define the concept of proximity? And will the rapporteur then define Denmark's immediate area? What is Denmark's proximity?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135828	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135832	I think I have just answered that question, so it will be a repeat of what I have just said, namely that I see Europe as our immediate area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135840	Then it's Mrs. Rosa Lund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135844	Thank you. I would very much like to follow up on this debate on neighbourhoods, because we have heard what Mr. Rasmus Stoklund sees as a nearby area and what Mr. Mads Birded perceives as a nearby area, but it is not defined anywhere. There isn't a fixed definition. In other words, the concept of proximity and the refugees we see helping is defined on the basis of the guts of those who are now the current majority. Well, then, sir. Mads Birds did not just confirm that this concept of proximity is something that either Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard, Mr. Mads Birded or Mr. Rasmus Stoklund has come up with and that it is not a concept that is so used?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135921	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315135922	In other words, we in the Left have been talking about help in the neighbourhood for as long as I can remember, so it is not a concept that has been invented for the occasion. But I fully agree that there is a very high degree of elasticity built into the term, and that is why we need to define what we mean by it. But it can also be difficult. There was before the example of Turkey, and we have a country like Russia that is geographically spreading across several continents. Is Vladivostok our vicinity to the same extent as Kaliningrad in the event of war there? Well, it's not.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140003	Rosa Lund, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140004	At least if you look at the distance, it is about as far from Greece to Syria as there is from Denmark to Ukraine, and now we are once part of the European Union, so from Mr. Mads Fuglede's arguments will also be part of our neighbourhood. And yet, sir... Mads Birded at the goal of an alien law that does not help people who flee Assad's bombs, and therefore I think this argument about proximity is quite weak. I'll be damned. I agree with what the Left has said over the past many years, but frankly, these are not fixed concepts.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140041	Then it is the rapporteur. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140042	I have just defined Europe as our immediate area, and Syria is not in Europe. It's gonna be weird having a discussion about whether it does it or not. Syria does not, so of course Syria is not part of our immediate area. We would like to make an effort where we get the most for the funds we spend on helping people in need, and that is always provided in the neighbourhood. However, this also means that the area of proximity has to shoulder a special responsibility. Now it is with us that responsibility must be lifted.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140112	Then it's mr. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140114	Thank you for your statement. I fully agree with the first point made by the rapporteur. We must, of course, help when Putin goes crazy and makes such a mess as he is doing in Ukraine at the moment. We must help those who, of course, are fleeing, but then there is funding. I would like to know whether it is true that the Left is also behind funding that takes 2.1 billion. kr., which is already planned to be given to e.g. Ethiopia, Mali and other places where there are also serious crises, and where there are even starvations, and they are transferred to the Danish municipalities' expenditure on refugees from Ukraine. Is the Left behind that funding? Or could one imagine a slightly more balanced financing where we paid some of it ourselves instead of taking the money from the poorest?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140203	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140204	We are behind the funding that is now. In practice, I believe that we can hope that with very short procedures and rapid access to the labour market there will be such a large retreat from the Ukrainians, because they already have a very high employment rate, that there will be a small move on the funds mentioned from development aid. I therefore believe that in the first year we may see that more money from development aid is being spent, but then the Ukrainians' employment rate will be so high that it will increase the amount spent on development aid. It is our hopes, but it is a very difficult balance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140252	Sir. Christian Juhl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140253	We don't know anything about that. There may be 100,000 coming. We don't know how crazy Putin is. For the time being, he's only shown up on the totally insane side. The Danes, on the other hand, have shown themselves from their good side. They say we pay. They give historically large amounts of money for collections and say that it may well cost something extra, because we have to help in this situation. But the Left says: No, we take money from the poorest people in the world. Is it not a little cynical to conduct politics like this instead of following the example of the Danes here in the Danish Parliament?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140323	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140324	I always find it difficult when we have these debates if my answers are misrepresented. I'm saying it's a difficult balance. And when I see camps in the neighbourhoods where we have already spent billions of kroner, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, it is not the case that I think they need less money. But now we are in a special situation and I think that for a short time there will be less funding for it, but if it continues, there may well be a need to look at it. I just do not think that this will be a real problem, because Ukrainian employment rates are so high that the money for development aid is being increased overall.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140401	Victoria Velasquez, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140402	Thank you. The rapporteur is now addressing the issue of the participation rate, and I am really concerned that there will be some employers who want to exploit Ukrainian citizens for social dumping. Unfortunately, we have seen before, and it was before, as a fugitive, you were in the situation and in need in the same way that employers have simply exploited Ukrainian citizens for social dumping. I would therefore like to know whether the rapporteur believes that we must ensure real tripartite negotiations to ensure that employment is, of course, carried out on terms similar to those laid down in collective agreements and the terms of employment in Denmark, so that there is no risk as a citizen of escaping war and then being exploited at home. The special law doesn't protect you from that. What do the rapporteur think we are doing about this problem?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140500	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140501	We in the Left are pleased with the Danish model, and Ukrainians who enter the Danish labour market must be here under orderly conditions. If it's not under fixed conditions, we'll have to clean it up. We hope, then, that the social partners will lift that part so that we do not have to make legislation on these issues, because the Danish model has worked since 1899, and we think it should continue to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140524	Victoria Velasquez.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140526	Thank you for that answer. The rapporteur knows very well that there are large sectors where it is not normal, unfortunately there is an agreement, for example. in the private labour market in the IT sector, if we are to take a concrete example, where we see that in Ukraine you would normally get a much lower salary than what is normally the salary you would get for IT work in Denmark. Let us take this as a concrete example. How does the rapporteur think we are going to clean up where there are no contractual conditions?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140559	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140601	I think that if we find that many Ukrainians are doing IT work in miserable conditions, we must make sure that the social partners are able to solve it, because we want those who enter the Danish labour market to work under conditions which are normal for both parties.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140620	Then it is Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard, Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140623	Thank you. This is a little in line with the question I also put to the Socialist rapporteur, since this is really a question of cultural understanding rather than all the surrounding area and so on. etc. I gave a lot of examples of how the 13,000 Ukrainians who have so far lived in Denmark have actually made a positive note instead of making a negative impression on people from North Africa and the Middle East. There is also another point that I think is very, very important and very, very important, and that is, of course, that we now see Ukrainian men staying at home and fighting, or they are taking home from other countries and fighting for their country while, as far as possible, sending women and children and old people out of the country. It is also a huge difference from what we have seen over a number of years. When it comes to the very many North African and Middle Eastern men who come to Denmark, families, women and children come, sometimes, but not always. It is, of course, the reverse world, so I really believe that what we are talking about now is a great deal about culture.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140729	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140730	It has been important to us that the Ukrainian men who go home to Ukraine to fight are helped by this special law, and I understand that there are many who do. I think culture means a lot of things, but I don't really see how it could in practice have changed anything about how we should make this special law. The problems of integration that we have experienced as a result of many years of immigration from North Africa and the Middle East are well known, and we must solve that in that context. For us, it is important that those we help come from a neighbourhood where I think we have a responsibility. This was the case with the Kosovo Albanians, and if there was a war in Sweden, where one in four is an immigrant, we should also help them, because that is also our immediate area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140840	Then it is Mrs Pia Kjærsgaard. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140841	I would just ask the rapporteur to agree with me. It is not difficult to integrate Ukrainians. You talk about integration. I do not think that this poses a great problem, because it has not caused any problems so far. You are content with very, very little, and you are deeply grateful to families who accept, you are deeply grateful to municipalities who accept. That is not what we have seen in all the years we have had the huge problems of foreigners, and that is a big difference for which I just think we should give Ukrainians credit.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140919	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140920	Now I am resident in the municipality of Denmark, which has most Ukrainians, namely Ringkøbing-Skjern Municipality. And there I can say that I have not met an unemployed Ukrainian yet, and that is why, when we get a large group of Ukrainians up here, they will be active and contribute to Danish society very, very quickly and that the problems of integration will be much smaller than what we have been fighting with.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140954	Then it's Mrs. Kathrine On Saturday, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315140957	I would like to return to the issue of the neighbourhood, because I think it is actually important, when we talk about Danish asylum policy and immigration policy, that we find out what we really mean. I do not think the Socialist rapporteur really got the answer to that. Let me ask you as directly as I can. Turkey meets the same criteria for being part of Europe and for being a neighbour of the European Union, in other words Greece. So, if Turkey were at war, which was the prerequisite for the Socialist rapporteur to help in the neighbourhood, would Turkey be to understand as a neighbourhood?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141030	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141031	I am glad that this question is being asked again. Those are words to the contrary, as I was asked by Mr. Sikandar Siddique, and my answer is exactly the same as last time I haven't changed my mind in the last five minutes. There is a part of Turkey that lies in Europe and if war broke out and they fled into Bulgaria and Greece from the European part of Turkey, then it is also in our vicinity, just as there was war in Kosovo. That is the same answer again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141104	Kathrine On Saturday.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141105	Then I will continue on a slightly milder blade. I would like to thank the Left for tapping into this special law. In fact, the Left were some of the very first to mention that it was important to help Ukrainian refugees. So I actually think it's a good idea for the cooperation that we should have on working with this special law, and I would also like to know if the Left could be open to some proposals on how we can finance this law in other ways than what has been proposed in the legislative text's comments.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141138	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141139	We would like to look at this on a regular basis. I think we will have to negotiate the basis of the special law as the number of Ukrainians increases in Denmark and as we see the effect of what we ask the Danish society to promise must be lifted. It has never been our wish that there should be no adjustment along the way, both in terms of funding and in terms of how the special law works in a number of areas. I think we need to help each other with that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141215	Thank you, sir. Mads Birded. There are no more brief comments. This means that we are moving forward in the rapporteur's line to Mr Beazley's report. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141225	Thank you. Russia's warlike attack on Ukraine led by Vladimir Putin is an attack on the free world. Russia's despicable, despicable actions will forever be a disgrace when the history books of the 21st century are to be written. Since 24 February, the Ukrainian people, with extraordinary courage and determination to fight, have defended not only their people, but their entire freedom and independence, against Putin's attacks. Putin's response has been brutal bombardment, and recently a children's hospital has also been hit. Such a thing creates refugees in our own backyard with a short distance to the fleeing countries and shorter than we have to the capital of Italy, Rome. History is going to judge us how we react, and therefore we must of course respond with open arms and with an incomprehensible message to the Ukrainians: you are welcome here as long as your homeland is taken from you by Putin's hatred of your national independence. In the SF we particularly support the special law on Ukrainians on the basis of three main reasons. Firstly, the special law ensures that displaced Ukrainians get a good start in Denmark, that they have direct access to the labour market, housing and daycare facilities. Secondly, the asylum system is in great difficulty; millions are fleeing the world and, therefore, the countries in the immediate vicinity of conflicts must assume responsibility for accepting it. For far too long it's been a free round. Now is the time for everyone to show that they meant what they said. DF and New Citizens have already failed that responsibility. The Conservatives were close to this, which, frankly, was appalling for a party that courtesy the Prime Minister's office. I hope we don't see any more shaking on the hand. Thirdly, SF's policy rests on the fact that the best must never become the enemy of the good. The SF usually votes in favour when a political agreement improves the conditions of the people it affects. Could conditions be better in the rest of the asylum system? Should any of the elements of this special law apply generally to everyone? Yes, indeed. And I also really hope that the discrimination against refugees, which is now becoming clear, will lead more parties to consider the approach they normally have. But that should not prevent us from taking the necessary responsibility for the Ukrainians who are so badly in need of us right now. Finally, I would like to add a few words to what this special law is missing according to the SF. These are three things in particular. I fear that the resources for proper reception of refugees are not available locally. We are not world champions in ensuring that newcomers receive the necessary help here in Denmark. And unlike in the past, we are dealing with a flood of refugees, which appears to be almost exclusively of women and children. Children's reception is absolutely and totally crucial to their having a good existence in Denmark, which is especially important if they are going to be here for many years. In the SF we have proposed a special family allowance for the municipalities that can help with the reception of refugees. It would also be wise for the government to use this opportunity to consider whether it is really smart to channel so much money from development aid into Danish refugee reception. It is, after all, some of the world's most vulnerable from which those funds go. The second thing I am concerned about is the growing desperate situation in Poland. There is overload in railway stations and freezing refugees. In SF we believe that Denmark should proactively transport refugees from Poland and other countries to Denmark. The last thing I have in mind and on which the SF is going to table an amendment is to have a guarantee for the processing times. Unfortunately, we have seen, both in general terms in the asylum system and in other special laws, how we can promise each other in here that refugees must be slushed quickly into society, only to see the processing times running out. For this reason, SF considers that the law should include a ceiling on the duration of proceedings, which the Folketing guarantees, also financially, so that if the system cannot keep to the times, it is possible to use additional resources and have that consumption covered by us. With that I would like to thank you for the floor and reiterate that, of course, the SF supports this bill. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141714	There are a few brief comments. First, it's sir. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141718	Thank you, President. And thank you for the moral sermon that I do not quite understand when you see the bill, which I understand the Socialist People's Party is voting in favour of it. In other words, that the rest of us do not want a shortcut for Arabs through a law to help Ukrainians, is it not roughly offset by the fact that the SF votes for a bill that does not help Ukrainians who happened to be on holiday in another country on 24 February? Or how will SF explain it? In other words, when you read section 1 paragraph 1. No. 1 1, it states: "The foreigner is a Ukrainian national and has left Ukraine on 24 February 2022 or later, where the person concerned was resident at the time of departure. This means, of course, that if one, we should say on 18 February, has gone on holiday in Poland or another neighbouring country to visit his family there, but then not exits from Ukraine on 24 February, are not covered by the law. So which way does Mr. Carl Valentin... that the hypocrisy points the most?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141820	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141822	I don't know what to say. Well, first you call what I'm talking about a moral sermon. I now think there is good reason to call for a little ethics and morality in this very serious situation and that Denmark takes its responsibility. And it is not a shortcut for Arabs that people in Ukraine, who have asylum status there, also have the opportunity for protection here. After all, it is people who have fled elsewhere and who are now going to flee again. Of course the law must also apply to them. Then Morten Messerschmidt finally talks about some problems in relation to the personal circle and some people who have been out of Ukraine at the time of the attack. Well, we'd like to be a part of that. So, SF has no problem working on how to expand this circle of people, and we would very much like to discuss this in committee. Let's finally do it. But in relation to this attack that this legislation should be a shortcut for Arabs, I think it's way above the limit. I just have to say that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141923	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315141924	Well, I guess it's just because sir... Carl Valentin hasn't read the bill. If he had dealt with paragraphs (a) and (b). 2 and not just pieces 1, he'd know that's what it's all about. So there are 2,274 third-country nationals from Afghanistan, Syria, etc. who are currently refugees in Ukraine. It is they, but not only them, for they are also the ones with whom they are connected, that is to say their family members and those with whom they have some kind of housing relationship that will be able to come to Denmark. And they don't even have to be in Denmark to apply. In other words, they may still be down in Syria. Well, what's it like to be a shortcut, unless mr. Carl Valentin just doesn't consider Syrians and Afghans Arabs. Maybe it's just semantics that separate us. Thank you for that!). But Mr. Surely Carl Valentin cannot escape the substance of the matter.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142003	Yes, sir. Morten Messerschmidt! We'll get an answer now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142004	I can promise you, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, that it is not semantics that separate us here; that is clearly attitudes. And that's right, sir. Morten Messerschmidt says, because I have it will destroy people more than it has already destroyed them, that they have potentially had to flee twice. I think it's very serious. And by the way, I think it's petty to look at such a small thing in such a big crisis as we are in here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142041	Sir. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142043	Thank you, President, and thank you to the rapporteur. I understand that the SF has been saying since this agreement was made that it is simply discrimination; the word discrimination has been used, and I think the rapporteur also used it in his speech. I very much need the rapporteur to explain to me the logic of saying that a law is discrimination, that it is discrimination, and that at the same time it lays down its mandates for the implementation of that discrimination. I simply do not understand that. I can also understand that today's support parties are also surprised by the fact that you could read in the press that you take 2.1 billion. kr. from the world's absolutely poorest people to finance this discrimination, and yet the proposal is supported. Will the rapporteur not tell me how this is logical?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142150	Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142151	That is what we are doing, and it is quite simple: we do not think that the perfect should be the enemy of the good. Therefore, we should not refrain from helping Ukrainians just because there is discrimination in this which I think is unfair. I think that all refugees should be able to quickly access, for example, the Danish labour market and have the opportunity to become part of society. There's a lot of parties in here that don't want to be part of that. I think that is a pity, but we should not make sure that the Ukrainians get a good start on their lives here. Then it is not true that we have been surprised that development aid is being channelled towards the reception of refugees in Denmark. This has been done for years. We still find this a problem, and that is why we are going to be working to change this funding, because I think it would be a pretty great disaster for the world's poor if you take so much money and channel it into this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142243	Sir. Sikandar Siddique, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142244	This legislation is, in its entirety, a disaster for the world's poorest, for the Syrians, for the Afghans and for all those who rot in this asylum hell that we have in Denmark. And then we come here with this special legislation, but the rapporteur must agree with me in the rapporteur's statement that it was an improvement that it is not an improvement. It's a special law. This is not an improvement on the general rules. So, that's not an improvement. The rapporteur must be able to confirm this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142315	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142316	Well, it is true that it is not a change to the general rules, but that is why it is still an improvement for a whole lot of people. And I don't know if Free Greens have a principle against special laws generally being nodded from down there. It may be that one would have voted against the Palestinian law, the law for Bosnians, including a lot of Muslims, or the Afghan law. Well, there are many cases where special laws have been made. This is done in crisis situations. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But the fact that you're in favour of making a special law doesn't mean that you're so... Well, now my time has passed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142351	It is. Mrs. Rosa Lund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142354	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech to Mr. Knox. Carl Valentin. I would also like to ask about the target group covered by this bill. Because if you read the implementing decision that came in connection with the EU directive, then it is quite clear that asylum seekers like Mr. Morten Messerschmidt is so afraid to be covered by this bill, according to the directive. But then there's something else in the government's bill anyway. And that has led us in the Enhedslisten to table an amendment to extend the target group of this special law. And I just want to know if SF agrees with that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142434	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142435	We need to see the proposal first, that is clear. However, I think that we in Denmark should take the legislation and the EU directive that is, and quite a lot copy it one into one, and therefore do not use our reservations to make a different arrangement. And that is why we are also open to expanding the circle of people. I myself have also asked the government in what areas Danish legislation in general differs from the directive. So the answer to that question I also look forward to delving into very much. And then, in committee, I think we should look at whether we can expand the circle of people if it is the case that the EU directive quite clearly does something else.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142517	Rosa Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142519	It is, of course, fair to see a proposal before you can say what you are voting for it. I would just like to add that the fact that we have reservations about EU policy also gives us the opportunity to do it a little bit better than the European Union and thus give residence to more people than what the directive does. This is certainly our starting point in the Enhedslisten. But I look forward to the committee reading.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142542	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142543	In fact, I think it is wrong what Mrs Rosa Lund says here at the end; that the reservation is not what allows us to do better. I mean, you always have to overimplement, as far as I know. So I would say that we could do better than the directive if we wanted to. Even if we didn't have a reservation. However, the reservation allows us, in return, to make it worse, and I do not think we should take advantage of that. And that's really what I was trying to say earlier.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142606	Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142607	Thank you. It's a little big to say that it's for years. In other words, the OECD relaxed the rules so that refugees and asylum seekers could be covered by the DAC rules, i.e. the rules to which development aid from countries is compared: where was the level in relation to Belgium? There are many countries which do not take advantage of that possibility, whereas unfortunately we have had two governments which have the civil and the present government which have a very, very tough immigration policy and which therefore count on everything as development aid; everything they can at all. And there I would like to hear the SF's position on it. Is it really true that you think it is so common that we should do so every time the government says so, or every time there is an opportunity to use development aid? Because it's basically people in Mali and Ethiopia who are going to pay this, not us Danes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142703	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142704	I hope it was clear from my speech that I criticise finding funding through development aid. And when I've said that you've been doing this for many years, maybe it's just because I'm young. I remember that in 2015 there was a big debate about it at the time when it was done. And it feels like years ago to me. But it is true that historically it is a relatively new trend to channel money into Danish refugee reception to that extent, and I just have to say quite clearly to Mr. Christian Juhl's question: SF opposes this. So, it is not SF's policy that a lot of money from development aid should be channelled into Danish refugee reception, because it undermines our development aid. And that is why we want to continue working on how to change this proposal so that perhaps something less of development aid is taken or something like that. Perhaps we could find a compromise there. I hope so. Because I see it as a pretty big problem for our development aid and our efforts in the world if you spend as much money on Danish refugee reception as has been proposed here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142804	Christian Juhl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142805	Yes, because one could imagine that it was more than 20,000 refugees who came, and suddenly development aid has been eroded. But I'm glad to hear this, because that's what I hear from other SFs, too, that I encounter, which is questionable. And I think it's important that people understand, that is, that there is actually that attitude in relatively many parties in the Folketing. I would like to hear what the SF thinks we could do instead of using development aid. Now the SF has been part of something called the national compromise, I think it has ended up being called where money is spent on military. Could you manage to spend some of that money instead?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142841	Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142841-2	Maybe it could. Now we are in the middle of an emergency procedure, and things are going a little fast, so I don't think I'm gonna make the complete funding here on my paper from the platform. However, I would very much like to enter into a dialogue with Enhedslisten on whether it might be possible to do something like this. So now the Enhedslisten is not part of the national compromise, so the situation is of course slightly different. But I am open to finding some other sources of funding. In any case, I think that the large amount of funding from development aid that has been set up for now is quite problematic.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142911	Thank you, sir. Carl Valentin. No more brief remarks, and that means that we go further in the rapporteur's line to Mrs Kathrine Oldag, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315142931	Thank you for that, President. It's been pretty fast. Not long ago we didn't have Ukraine at all. And see how quickly, and see what we can and how effective we can actually be when we have an immediate crisis and a war on our doorstep. I think that in itself is politically promising for future cooperation between the parties. Today we are discussing a bill that allows people who have been displaced from Ukraine to have a dignified and safe life in Denmark, away from asylum centres and with quick access to work, school and welfare services. We stand ready with open arms, and we meet the Ukrainians with empathy, mercy and humanity. But I cannot stand here without, at the same time, addressing the contrast to how we receive other refugees and the obvious discrimination that is taking place. When the Syrians came to Denmark, we talked about a refugee crisis. They were met by jewelry law and the so-called paradigm change, which tells them that they are not welcome and that, as soon as possible, they must return home, whether they have done everything in their power in the meantime to integrate into our society. For the Radical Left, it is important to emphasise that a move is a move wherever they have fled. This does not rule out the fact that we do not want to vote against a special law for the Ukrainians. It is my hope that the warmth and openness shown to the Ukrainian refugees will also extend to everyone on the run, and today I also have to praise the draft law, which is basically a great free community attempt. As a Liberal, one can only be happy to see that we are now giving the municipalities a breathing space from many of the usual demands and deadlines that go with the integration task. I hope that we will see that efforts are better adapted to the needs of the individual than they are today, and that there will be a great deal of ownership of the integration efforts in the municipalities, in civil society. At the same time, I would like to congratulate the official work I know you haven't slept very much, which in record time has succeeded in making a comprehensive bill that hopefully will work out in the municipalities. And it will be exciting to see how the municipalities report back it is actually implemented. At the same time, as an integration rapporteur, I am very anxious to follow what this reception, which the refugees will receive when they are quickly slugged into society, will have an impact on Ukrainian integration in Denmark. I think we will see that we are much stronger when we meet refugees with goodwill and openness. It is now essential for us to ensure that as many people as possible are covered by the bill and have access to temporary protection in Denmark. That is why we shall be voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the Enhedslisten which extend the circle of people. At the same time, we are concerned that the funding, as much as the draft law proposes, is based on funds that should go to development aid in the poorest parts of the world. However, since, for technical reasons, we cannot table amendments to the funding, we have instead asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Integration for an opinion in the report which confirms that the funding of the bill is being changed, so that funding in 2022 is more based on the use of general reserves rather than development aid. All in all, thank you for your cooperation. Thanks for working through the office. In the Radical Left, we will never vote against helping people flee. That is why we support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143309	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a desire for short comments. The first one's for sir. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143313	I heard the rapporteur start by accusing Danish immigration policy of being based on discrimination, as well as a negative connotation. I was reminded of this: is it not very natural that we treat different things differently, that is to say, when we are dealing with European peoples from a religious and culturally related part of the world, with whom we can of course help, all the time that we only have good experiences, it makes sense to open our arms and open our hearts, unlike when we are dealing with the people who come mostly from the Muslim world and with whom we have really, really bad experiences, based on both the economic consequences, employment rates, integration in the broad sense, participation in the labour market, etc.? In fact, would it not be completely crazy to say that two so different groups of people had to be treated equally?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143417	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143418	Every time, sir. Morten Messerschmidt opens his mouth, I can feel that there is only a difference between the Danish People's Party and the Radical Left, and that is actually very nice, because then you get such a sense of who you are. And right here, the Danish People's Party probably tends to be incredibly black and white. I'm coming, for example. from West Jutland, and I also know about the Ukrainian workers over there and their perseverance, but they are here on business schemes. And the thing about paying tribute to 40 million people for being hard-working on the basis of Ukrainians who are in Denmark on a business scheme, I actually think it is also to enshrine them as people and as individuals. After all, they are different when they come here, and we must be prepared to deal with that too. So when Mr. Morten Messerschmidt says that people should be treated differently, so we say: No, a refugee is a refugee, and when people need protection, they must be treated equally, no matter what religion may follow.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143511	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143512	Yes, and that is the foolish view I would like to display. In other words, when we have good experiences not only with Ukrainians, but also with Hungarians, with Czechs, with people from the Western world in general • Of course there may be a few flickers among etc., so it will always be, even with people from West Jutland; there are also some who fall through, but overall integration is successful there • It is a completely crazy view to say that we must also open our country to people who come from a completely different cultural and religious background. Well, can't Mrs. Kathrine on Saturday take us into the world where four and five can be equal in that way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143550	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143551	Why is it that Mr. Morten Messerschmidt will not acknowledge that there is also a difference between Ukrainians? The whole of Eastern Europe has major problems with the Mafia, for example, with organised crime. When we look at the picture of how trafficking e.g. In Denmark, we see that this is happening to a very large extent via Eastern European gangs from various Eastern European countries. Therefore, you cannot just cut all people over a comb, neither Muslims nor Ukrainians.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143619	The next brief remark is to Mr. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143623	Thank you for the floor, President. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Radicals. I would say that this is a black day for Danish politics today... really a black day. For the whole left, apart from the Free Greens, we are now de facto helping to stamp discrimination. All week, we have heard the support parties shouting out that it is discriminatory legislation, it is discrimination. Yes, today you also see the Radical Left and the Enhedslisten in the newspaper saying that they are angry that you are taking the money from the world's poorest people to fund this legislation. And yet the support parties say that everything is wrong with this legislation, but we will support it anyway. I simply do not understand the logic. If the law here is discriminatory, will the rapporteur at least recognise that we are voting in favour of discrimination?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143727	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143728	Now I can also feel the difference between Radicals and the Free Greens, because the Greens want to just be mad that all the other left wing parties are voting for this law, pissed that we are saying that it is discrimination and yet vote for it and climb up on the high horse and do nothing but be upset that we think it is financed wrong. What do we do? We go into the law, we work with it. We are actively proposing what other types of financing models there are. And what does Free Green do other than go on Facebook?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143757	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143758	I can say that it is not just the Free Greens who are angry. Refugees Wellcome is also pissed off, and many organizations are also pissed off. A lot of fire-souls fighting every single day out in the asylum hell we have, which among other things. Radicals have created by making § 7 pcs. 3 together with the Social Democrats, are also angry. I just want to repeat once again: you are shooting at us in the Free Greens, yes, just do it but you cannot run away from the fact that today is the second time that you are smashing the people who live in that asylum hell, namely first by low § 7 paragraph. 3 for Syrians, and today by voting for a discrimination that makes us make a team A and a team B. You can never run away from that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143840	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143841	We just have to note that if the Free Greens had 90 mandates, there might have been some sort of weight behind those words, but one cannot change the world by just always staying far away from all regular legislation. I also think that the Greens will learn that at some point.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143855	Thank you to the radical rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Enhedslisten, and that is Mrs Rosa Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315143914	Do the horrors of war feel different in Afghanistan than in Ukraine? Is Assad's bombs more destructive than Putin's? How do you actually measure the desperation of a refugee from Eritrea compared to one from Ukraine? These are impossible answers to impossible questions, but nevertheless the question to which the government believes it has an answer when it makes a special law for Ukrainian refugees, regardless of the fact that refugees can also come from other countries when they flee from Putin's war. In the Enhedslisten, I would like to say quite frankly, we are in a dilemma with this bill because we believe that it is deeply problematic and discriminatory that different rules should apply to different people who have the same need for protection. Our aim is to make improvements to the Aliens Act, which must apply to all people on the run, and not to specific special laws for certain groups. At the same time, however, we do not believe that we can abandon the Ukrainians in this terrible situation where there are more than 2 million people fleeing Putin. In the Enhedslisten, we will never say no to helping people flee, and we are ready to help the Ukrainians, not because they are Ukrainians, or because they resemble us, as Mr. Morten Messerschmidt says, but because they're refugees. For basically, we believe that the issues of when and what refugees we should provide protection are obvious, and these are issues that should be cleared of demands of origin, geography, religion, skin colour and ethnicity. In fact, this special law is to a large extent an expression of the right approach to refugees. They should not wither in an asylum centre while their case is being dealt with. With the special law, Ukrainian refugees can get to work, get accommodation, go to school and have as normal a life as possible in Denmark. It is good, it is the right thing to do, it is the right way to treat people on the run. The special law applies only to refugees from Ukraine, while refugees from Syria and Somalia do not enjoy the same rights. They are covered by the law on foreigners, and that is, indeed, discrimination. It is a cynical selection of people on the basis of nationality, culture and geography. And I'm just asking, why really? In the course of today's debate, we have been trying to get an answer to this with what a neighbourhood is, because there are several who say that the argument for making a special law is that we should help in our vicinity. But how many kilometres do you have to live from Denmark to be entitled to protection? What really is the distance between life and death? I do not think that we have received an answer today either from Mr Beazley. Rasmus Stoklund or Mr. Mads Birded. That is why I think that is a very strange argument. We help people because they are on the run not because of religious considerations or because of cultural considerations or because of how many kilometres they are away from us. If the Danish alien law is not good enough for the Ukrainians, why is it so good enough for the Syrians, for the Afghans, for the Somalis? The answer is from Enhedslisten that it is not. When it is necessary to make a special law in order to protect people fleeing a tyrant like Putin, it exhibits how tight, inhumane and inhumane our alien law is. In fact, it is so outdated and absurd that few refugees from Ukraine would be able to stay in accordance with our current rules, and that is why a special law is now being drawn up. In the Enhedslisten, we want to help all people on the run, not with special laws, but by amending the current alien legislation so that it gives asylum to all those people who need protection. For it is now at this historic time, when there is rare broad support in here to help people on the run, that we have to change the law on foreigners. So when we support this special law in the Enhedslisten, it is not with pleasure, because we would rather have seen it differently; but we support this special law because we will never say no to giving protection to people who are on the run. Then there is a huge outstanding and problem with funding. It simply cannot be said that so much must now be taken from development aid. The framework we have agreed in the Finance Act is 300 million. kr.; what's being proposed with this bill is 2 billion. kr. This is a major economic difference, and I think we simply have to discuss it in committee. I have no more time left now, thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144414	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are a number of brief comments. It is only from Mrs Krarup outside the groups. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144419	Thank you. It sounds as if Enhedslisten thinks that it should be feelings that determine who gets asylum in Denmark. I understand that when you see pictures of people who are suffering, you get pity. I really get that myself. But I cannot understand why the Enhedslisten believes that it is cynical not to grant asylum to people from the Middle East or from distant countries who have no cultural community with Danes. I believe that it is cynical to the Danes to allow all people who suffer in the Third World to have people from countries which have absolutely no cultural community with Denmark to stay in Denmark. So I think that Enhedslisten, in this way, is distorting the debate. It is not they who want to give Ukrainians rather than Muslims from the Middle East residence or asylum in Denmark that are cynical. It is Enhedslisten who is cynical when they want to open up to get Muslims to Denmark, because it is cynical to the Danish population. The Danish people cannot do that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144533	Thank you. Then it is the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144534	Well, Mrs Marie Krarup can take it quite calmly, because we do not believe in the Enhedslisten that foreign policy should be based on feelings or gut feelings. We believe that it should be based on conventions and rights. And I think, according to the refugee convention, that those who are currently fleeing Assad and from the Taliban in Afghanistan should have the right to asylum in Denmark. They would also have it if we did not have the freak in Danish alien law called Section 7 of the Aliens Act. 3. So Mrs. Marie Krarup can take it easy. Our immigration policy is based on rights, not on emotions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144614	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144615	But it is also cynical to the Danes to say that you can make a completely general piece of legislation that affects everyone, because there is a difference. Of course, it is considerably easier to receive a Christian European population on the run than it is to receive a Muslim and distant population on the run. It is cynical to the Danish people to pretend that there is no difference. And we have seen the damage that has been done in Denmark by the fact that the completely insane immigration policy has been pursued for too many years. That is why it is good that we are opening the country to Ukrainians, but it is wrong to open the country to anyone on the run.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144659	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144700	I think that what is cynical is that over the last very many years in Danish immigration and integration policy, so many people have stumbled in order to achieve good integration. We offer people money to go back. We tell them to pay to learn our language. A lot of trip threads have been laid out. And then I would hope that this will give rise to a little self-examination in the Danish People's Party, which is probably the party that has put the most votes to foreign law in Denmark over the last 30 years.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144729	The next brief remark is from Mr. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144732	Thank you for the floor and thank you to Mrs Lund. On 4 March, we negotiated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration put a document on the No comma has been moved in relation to whom the rule applies. On 6 March, I will receive a newsletter that Mrs Rosa Lund sends to members of the Enhedslisten on 6 March, and the title is: Special Act on Clear Device List Images. I have a copy of this. This is the title that Mrs Rosa Lund sends to the members of the island: Special Act on Clear Device Site Images. Will the rapporteur explain what clear Single List images have been included in the agreement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144828	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144829	Thank you. Well, first of all, I have to say that it's nice that Mr. Sikandar Siddique subscribes to the Enhedslisten newsletter, which is for Enhedslisten members. Sir. Sikandar Siddique is welcome. The clear Device List image, which I also know to Mr. Sikandar Siddique knows we were discussing in the room at the negotiations, is exactly who should be included in this law. As everyone, I think, is familiar with, sir. Marcus Knuth to get people with refugee status in Ukraine out of the bill, but the rapporteur for the SF and Radical Left and myself fought to leave them behind. And I always think, I must apologize, sir. Marcus Knuth says it's a victory for the Enhedslisten when we sit in a room where I get right, and Mr. Marcus Knuth isn't gonna get right.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144915	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315144916	I think it's comical. So the clear Device list prints in the agreement are that no comma has been moved. So, the agreement that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration put on the table is one for someone who has been agreed, and that is just such clear prints. Then the newsletter also goes on to Members, and I read from the newsletter, as Mrs Rosa Lund writes: we have succeeded in ensuring that the new special law concerns both Ukrainians and asylum seekers from Ukraine. That's factually wrong. Is that a typo? The rule applies only to Ukrainian citizens and 2,400 people with refugee status. So is it a mistake for the rapporteur to write it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145002	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145004	When we wrote this newsletter and again I have to say that it is wonderful that members of parliament from other parties think that Enhedslisten is so cool that they read our newsletter, and they are very welcome to it, it was very clear that this agreement should be as close to the directive as possible. And as stated in the implementing decision of the directive on page 2, Mr. Sikandar Siddique then asylum seekers are included. Then it is clear that when we make an agreement that must lie as close as possible to the directive, we of course believe in it. Then comes the draft law... it came here yesterday morning... and there are asylum seekers so suddenly not included. We are, of course, very sorry about this in the Enhedslisten, which is why we have tabled an amendment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145049	The next brief remark is from Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145054	Thank you, President. Perhaps because it is an area in which I can agree with Mrs Rosa Lund, this is how far from Denmark you have to come in order for it to be from a nearby area. Because I fully agree with Mrs Rosa Lund in that makes no sense. I mean, you might as well say, how far is a heartband? Well, it is quite obvious that an Argentine would have easier to settle in Denmark than a Somali, even if there is longer to Argentina than there is to Somalia, or that a Canadian would have easier to settle in Denmark than a Moroccan. And I'm just glad that Enhedslisten seems and has found himself in the practical reality that of course it is not the geography that determines who Denmark can help with benefit and interest and passion, but that it is of course about those with whom we share heart, that is, those who love the fundamental principles, freedoms and the idea and belief on which our civilisation, the West, is built.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145203	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145204	I think, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, that it's always about what you're running from, so not about how far away it is, or what you're going to believe or think about all sorts of different things, but about what you're running from. Are you fleeing from a country where the bombs are raining; are you fleeing because you are homosexual and it is illegal to be in the country in which you were born; are you fleeing because you live in a country where it is not lawful to believe anything other than the majority? So for us in the Enhedslisten, it's not about how far away it is, but about what if you're running from.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145238	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145238-2	After all, Mrs. Rosa Lund is talking about why people are fleeing. That's not what we talked about before. What we talked about before was whether they should flee to Denmark, therefore, not about the country of dispatch, but about the recipient country. So, in relation to the recipient country, it is irrelevant what it is that makes people unable to be in their own country. What must be at the heart of Denmark is whether we accept people who naturally fit in with our way of life, our way of being people. And there I would just like to pay tribute to Mrs Rosa Lund for seeing that it is not the distance in kilometres that does, but the cultural and human distance between Denmark and the person who comes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145317	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145318	I don't think that's what I said, sir. Morten Messerschmidt. I think maybe it was, sir. Morten Messerschmidt said. But what determines it for us is the question of what we have room for in Denmark and what we can afford in Denmark. And that's how it is now, sir. Morten Messersschmidt, that with the Danish People's Party at the helm there are suddenly only 12 asylum centres left in Denmark. Ten years ago, there was an asylum centre in each municipality, and it is clear that when there is a large flow of refugees, there are problems. I just think that's what I'm saying to us in here at Christiansborg, that we'll have to reopen those asylum centres. I simply do not agree that it is cultural issues that determine this. In fact, I said quite clearly in my speech, sir. Morten Messerschmidt that refugee issues should be cleared of questions of culture and ethnicity.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145405	The next brief remark is to Mr. Rasmus Stoklund, the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145407	Thank you, President. Before Mrs Rosa Lund said that in the Enhedslisten you want to help all people flee. Now, according to the UN, there are well over 80 million people who have been displaced from where they should be able to live. And how many of them is it that Mrs Rosa Lund wants to help here in Denmark? Let us just say, for example, that it is only 5 million of them, what would Mrs Lund say to No. 5,000.001 when he came from Somalia and said: Mrs Rosa Lund, I would like to live with you here in Denmark? What would Mrs. Rosa Lund say to the Somali who was no. 5,000.001 and which Mrs. Rosa Lund didn't think there was room for? Now I don't know if the limit is 5 million people, it may also be that it is 10 million people, but what would she say to number 10,000,001? I believe that Mrs Rosa Lund understands the principle of the issue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145454	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145456	- Sir, you can. Rasmus Stoklund thinks I do. And exactly what Mr. Rasmus Stoklund himself says, is the reason why you can't put a number on it. The fact that Denmark, as one of the first countries in the world, has signed the Refugee Convention, means that we want to give protection to those who are entitled to it, and that does indeed mean that we can put a figure on it. Then I would also like to add, sir. Rasmus Stoklund, that we are not in a situation where Denmark is full. In other words, we have very, very strict rules so that very few residence permits are granted. As I said before, sir. Morten Messerschmidt, we have been in a situation for many years, where so few refugees came that we have closed asylum centres. And that's why I think that Mr. Rasmus Stoklund's question is a little bit hypothetical.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145537	Sir. Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145538	Yes, as long as Enhedslisten does not have 90 seats, it is fortunately hypothetical, but otherwise it would not be, because the 80 million people could, if that were the case, as Mrs Rosa Lund wanted, that there was a special law for all people so that they could just immediately come here and settle down, then it would be a condition that there were 80 million people who could immediately travel to Denmark and say: Here we would like to live. And there I find it interesting to know what Mrs Rosa Lund would say if there is any limit at all. Mrs Rosa Lund says so, so there are no conventions. But if you were to play with the idea that there was some kind of border before Denmark was completely dismantled, what would Mrs. Rosa Lund say to for example No. 5,000,001 coming from Afghanistan or Somalia? What would be the arguments we wanted to hear about why he could not live here as well?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145617	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145618	But it is simply a strange thought experiment that the rapporteur is engaged in. I actually think we all know in here that Denmark cannot house all the refugees in the world. We know that too in the Enhedslisten. But I just think it is strange that we should put a figure on when we are in a situation where we take so few refugees in Denmark. We have plenty of room, and we can afford it, too, sir. Rasmus Stoklund. This, of course, places great demands on our asylum system, and it also places great demands on our integration efforts, but I simply do not buy the argument that we can only make foreign policy if we put a figure on it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145701	The next brief remark is to Mr. Torsten Gejl, the alternative. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145701-2	Thank you so much. And thank you for your speech. Now I've only been a member of the Folketing for almost seven years, but I don't think I've ever heard so many parties be so much against a law and then vote for it. And that is not, in my opinion, because all the parties have lost the suck, but it is because this is a huge dilemma, as the rapporteur also says, or a lot of dilemmas. One of them is the question I would like to ask here: do we not risk, when we vote in favour of dispensing, or when we vote in favour of this special law, which shows the government's miserable refugee policy, really impose the refugee policy? Because when it turns out how bad it is, we'll just dispense from it. We can do that another time. So, in reality, we are not in danger of putting a really bad refugee policy on the line by dispensing with it at the end of the day, and it turns out how bad it is?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145758	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145759	No, I don't think so, sir. Torsten Gejl. I am on the basis that this can be used to break up the bad immigration policy that this can just be used to show how the right way is to treat people on the run. I think that's what this special law can be used for, that is to say it really shows how strange and inhumane the rules we have in Denmark are when we have to make a special law to help these people. I fully agree with that. And I'm thinking that this special law can be used as a wallbreaker or as a springboard, you might say, to make a different alien policy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145838	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145842	I do disagree with that very much, but of course I respect that position. But there's another thing where I have to give Mr. Sikandar Siddique right. I was also in the negotiations with regard to this special law, and Enhedslisten writes at the bottom of their newsletter and now I have borrowed the Enhedslisten newsletter from Mr. Sikandar Siddique: We managed to ensure that the new special law concerns both Ukrainians and asylum seekers from Ukraine. It is listed under a heading called "Special Act with Clear Device List Releases." I don't think that's really history writing. Well, I was in that room, too. We were a lot of parties fighting for these people, of course, to be included too, that is, people who had already been granted asylum. My impression was that they had arrived, whether Enhedslisten had been there or not. So I think you should write the story a little more accurately instead of pretending that the work we all did was only one party that should have the credit for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145930	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315145933	I mean, 'cause sir... Torsten Gejl himself was present in the room, he also knows that the Minister said very clearly that the special law should be as close to the directive as possible. And since it is in the implementing decision for the directive on page 2 that asylum seekers are covered, I do not think it is so strange that we in the Enhedslist think that they are the ones that I honestly do not think so. And next time I'm gonna write the Device List and Alternative Footprint in a newsletter for Enhedslisten members.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150003	Thank you to Mrs Rosa Lund from the Enhedslisten. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur in the series of rapporteurs comes from the Conservative People's Party, and that is Mr Conservatives. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150022	Thank you, President. We are here today on a very sad and tragic background. Ukraine, a European country, has been invaded by Russia. All indications are that Russia's bombs hit everything from residential buildings to orphanages and hospitals. Ukrainians must leave their homes, or what is left of it, and while many Ukrainian men remain to fight for their country. What we are witnessing right now is perhaps the most landmark event in Europe since the Second World War. A free and independent European country is under attack. That is why we in Denmark have a very special obligation to help the Ukrainians who are fleeing their country of origin these days. Over 2 million have already fled from Ukraine to Poland, Romania, Moldova and further up through Europe to where they have family or friends. In the Conservative People's Party, we already proposed in the very first days of the war that Denmark should make an exception to Ukrainians who came here to get through our asylum system. We have said that Ukrainians coming to Denmark should automatically have a minimum stay of one year, that adults should be able to enter the labour market directly, that children should be able to go directly to school and institution, and that Ukrainians should have access to our welfare society and health system from day one. Inheriting Ukrainians should of course also have their residence and work permits extended; there are about 15,000 living in Denmark. And we suggested that the Ukrainians who so wish should have the opportunity to go back to Ukraine and fight for their country of origin without affecting their residence status or their family's basis here in Denmark. It took some time, but quietly, fortunately, there was support among all the parties in the Danish Parliament for our proposal. We also think that our proposal is very well incorporated into the legislative proposal as it stands here. However, in the Conservative People's Party, we have also said over and over again that refugees must be helped in their neighbourhood. This is a subject that I think has been discussed quite a lot here today. We believe that we have a special responsibility towards Ukrainians, both because they are our European neighbours, but also because they are a close partner. They have a desire to join the European Union and they have a desire to join NATO. In my view, there is absolutely no question at all that, of course, it is something very special when it is a European country, a country in the midst of Europe, that is at war. That is why we are also tabling an amendment to the legislative proposal before us. Now I understand that there are a number of amendments on the way, so we need to look at how we do it in committee. But overall it is that people with refugee status in Ukraine I understand that most are from Syria and Afghanistan... must go through the ordinary Danish asylum system if they come to Denmark, because that is how we usually help, and we must of course continue to do so in the future. So when refugees arrive here from Syria, Afghanistan and so on, who have been in Ukraine in the past, we must of course help them to the extent we can, but we must do so through the ordinary asylum system. We think there is something fundamentally wrong in suddenly creating two tracks: if you travel through Europe via one route or via the other route from Syria, you can get one or the other basis of stay. We simply do not think this difference is right. Having said that, we want to give a very special helping hand to the Ukrainians who are on the run. We proposed, as some of the first, that there should be a special law, and that is what we are dealing with here with a number of things that we do not agree with. That is why we support the draft law, even if there will be no support for our amendments, however it may be formulated. Because we also want to help people from Syria and Afghanistan, but it must be in the way that has been the case over the past many, many years, through the asylum legislation that we broadly agree on here in the Folketing. The homes of the Ukrainians are under attack, and that is why the Conservative People's Party is, of course, ready to do what is necessary and to help our European neighbours with this special law that we will be voting in favour of. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150431	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are a number of brief comments. It's first for Mr. Knox. Sikandar Siddique, Free Green. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150436	I thank the rapporteur for the Conservatives. We in the Greens also wanted to table an amendment, but the Minister and the Ministry have now said that this is not possible. We wanted to make an amendment to the effect that the special law included all refugees and not just one group. I quote: no one dares say it as it is. You wrap discrimination into an explanation of proximity. It is Mrs Inger Løjberg who writes it. And she also writes that it is in fact because Ukrainians are more like us and are Christians, and therefore we are more inclined to help Ukrainians. I have a simple question. Does the rapporteur agree with Mrs Inger Løjberg's view?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150531	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150534	I agree with the recital which I read myself just now. Ukraine is a country in the middle of Europe. Of course, there is no doubt that it is a close area, but it is also a country with a close community of values with us. It is a country that hopes to enter NATO and join the European Union. I do not quite understand the need to have this discussion about what is a nearby area and what is not. In other words, Ukraine is a neighbouring country, and of course we have a responsibility to help them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150554	Sir. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150556	In any case, I am glad that this is a clear speech. Points for that. Yeah, there's a difference between where you're from and what you look like. It's a clear speech. That's something you can always work on. But there's a need to talk about this in the vicinity. Because then comes the natural next question: what about Turkey or Libya, which lies between two or three countries? When is a nearby area a nearby area? And will the rapporteur not confirm that proximity is something that has been found politically, fair enough, but that it is certainly not part of the refugee convention? Will the rapporteur confirm that the proximity principle is not part of the refugee convention?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150634	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150635	Well, now, listen, there are a whole range of areas where there are differences between countries. So, within the Nordic countries we have a lot of special agreements that apply only between the Nordic countries. Within the European Union, we have a lot of special agreements that apply within the European Union, we can travel freely, we can work freely. And then there are a lot of countries that have other forms of cooperation with Denmark. An Ukrainian he travels freely into Denmark and is here 90 days. So can an American. You can't do that if you come from Syria or Afghanistan. So there are already a large number of differences, and that's just the difference between Ukrainians that we want to expand, so that in this case they can be here for two years.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150709	The next brief remark is to Mrs Kathrine Olly, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150712	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. I must admit that we in Radicals were quite surprised by Conservatives. We agree that we stand in different places in terms of foreign policy, but when it comes to resolving a common European crisis together, Conservatives tend to stamp in and not be as persistent as it was in this case, where the nervousness of getting 2,300 with refugee status from other third countries was what was, as it were, a crucial point for Conservatives. In fact, we were rather insecure about this. Conservatives tend to be a party that is for the European Union and that wants to get rid of the defence reserve and with which we have just made a major national compromise, so my question is: Is Conservatives still a government-worthy party?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150800	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150802	I think that is up to the electorate to decide, but I hope it is. I think a lot of different things are mixed up here. I find it hard to see that I have anything to do with this special law. What we are holding on to is that there is something wrong in making a new separate track for people who come here from, for example. Syria and Afghanistan, which are not our immediate area, and mix it into a special law where you want to help people flee from Ukraine, so that if you are Syrians and come here through one route, then you have to through the asylum system, but if you have taken another route, you will just get a stay. We don't think that's fair. It is not because we are not saying that the 2,300, if they all come here, cannot come here and get asylum, but it should not be under a special law that applies to Ukrainians.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150851	Mrs. Kathrine On Saturday.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150853	Then let me cut it a little bit. Conservatives tend to be as fond of the European Union and directive implementation as the Radical Left, and for us it was absolutely crucial that the directive should be followed when we made a special law, that is to say that we one for one got as close to it as possible. Here we just think that Conservatives deviated from a principle that they actually tend to stand quite firm on. Is Conservatives no longer the social party with the big heart on the right as it used to be?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150921	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150923	We are a party with a great heart, but we are not always in the same place as the Radical Left. I think that's pretty clear. In other words, not long ago we had the discussion that fathers should be given compulsory maternity leave, as the European Union says they should. We do not support that, but the Radical Left supports it, so I think there are many areas where we look at things differently politically.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150942	The next brief remark is to Mr. Carl Valentin, Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315150946	Thank you. Well, you can tell that Mr. Marcus Knuth is extremely strict that these people with refugee status in Ukraine are included in the proposal and that they are given the opportunity to come here and be protected on an equal footing with the Ukrainians so tight that they were actually willing to leave the joint agreement we made at the time. Now we want to support the proposal. I'm glad you've come to that realization, but why is this really so important for Conservatives? I understand that with two leads that are being talked about a lot, but it is people who have already been granted asylum status. They have dealt with their case, they were given protection in Ukraine. Isn't it a bit violent to have to put them through the whole system again when they're on the run for the second time? That's really just my question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151042	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151044	We have the quiet view that we support the asylum system that we have had for many years and which is supported by a broad majority here in the Danish Parliament and which says that if you come here from Syria or Afghanistan, you will be treated through the asylum system and you will have protection, and if that is the case that you have a need for protection, then you will also be given refugee status and can stay here in Denmark. It's the only thing we hold on to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151105	Sir. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151107	I think the rapporteur simplifies it because their asylum applications have been dealt with, so it is just an expression of the lack of confidence in the Ukrainian authorities and Ukraine, where the matter has been dealt with. I think it is crazy that these people should be exposed to it, and indeed they are so few people. I would also just like to hear Conservatives: how do you think Europe would have reacted to Denmark's going alone as the only EU country in this and like to deviate from the directive? Wouldn't it look very violent that for some particular reason, Denmark just wouldn't help this tiny group of people?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151144	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151146	I do not think there is anything violent about sticking to the quite excellent asylum system that we have had for many years and which Mr. Carl Valentin himself supports this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151154	The next brief remark is to Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151157	Thank you, President-in-Office, and thank you to the rapporteur for at least being on the same team at least part of the journey, one might say. During the negotiations, we agreed on the view expressed by the rapporteur in relation to Arabs. But what I would like to ask is that paradoxical thing, which I have also held out to other rapporteurs, i.e. that this law helps Ukrainian citizens who have left Ukraine on 24 February or later, understand that if you have been on holiday in Poland or Belarus or elsewhere on 22 February, you cannot be included. But you want to help the family members of Syrians and Afghans who are not in Europe. Isn't there anything basically counterintuitive that you make the difference that Ukrainians who have no home to return to because it is bombed cannot be helped according to § 1 paragraph 1. 1, whereas Arabs, who are fortunate enough to have a family member who has been granted asylum in Ukraine, can be helped?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151301	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151303	I think that is an interesting consideration, as Mr. Morten Messerschmidt comes along because I have also wondered why section 1 applies only to Ukrainians who left Ukraine after 24 February, and if you have been on holiday in Germany or England, you are not included. However, we may be able to discuss this during the committee procedure itself. We have always said that it should apply to all Ukrainians, regardless of whether they were in the country before or after 24 February. And then, in terms of whether to include people from Syria and Afghanistan in this special law for Ukraine, I think I have said exactly what we mean.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151336	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151338	Well, I'm glad we share that view. The reason I became aware of this was that there was one of the hearings that actually touched on it. It was from a Helge Bruun Hansen. And that is actually the only really useful consultation answer that has been given. I wonder, for example, that... Grandparents of Asylum are on such a list, without you, for example. consults the ROCKWOOL Foundation. I can hardly find anyone who has an objective approach to refugee and immigration policy on that consultation list. Has it fallen too, sir? Marcus Knuth in?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151409	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151411	At any rate, I find it strange that the ROCKWOOL Fund is not included, but perhaps it would be better if Mr. Morten Messerschmidt takes it directly with the Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151426	The next brief remark is to Mr. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151428	Thank you. In the conciliation that I am working on, we usually do things like the Minister, so you might as well ask the rapporteur, and I would like to ask him about the funding. The 2.1 billion. kr. to be financed by development aid. That is to say, to the people who are starving in Ethiopia, Mali, Yemen, South Sudan and where we help and where we have promised them in our Finance Act that by 2022 we will help them with a large or small amount, we now have to say: No, unfortunately, we have another task to do. Is it conservative policy to take from the poorest in the world to help municipalities accept refugees in Denmark? Let me just say that I think it is okay that we welcome all the refugees from Syria who need it. It is so necessary to do so, but I think it is a very, very cynical way of financing it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151521	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151526	Of course, we also think it is very good that we welcome refugees, both from Ukraine and from Syria, in other words those who actually need protection. As far as funding is concerned, I am aware that this is not very different from 2015 and 2016, when we also took development aid, because development aid is meant to help people who are fleeing from war, and here we are talking, to say the least, about people who are fleeing from war. If that is enough of the amount at present, then it is something that the Minister has to deal with over time. But in any case, we are talking here and now about people fleeing from war, and it is being taken from a box which, among other things, is. to help people flee from war.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151606	Sir. Christian Juhl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151608	But since the Danes themselves had the corona, there was no limit to what we could help with here, and then we didn't leave the world's poorest. When a so-called national compromise was made to get more military in Denmark, there were no narrow places either. A large part of the cost could then even be financed by loans. Is it not a little cynical to say that, when it comes to refugees, we can no longer do so? I would like to remind you that the Danes are taking away so much; they deliver to the collections, they supply clothes, they supply food, and they provide shelter. Does the rapporteur not believe that the Danes have also had the expectation that the Folketing will find a way of spending Danes' money on refugees, not the poorest in the world?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151648	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151650	I must remind you that it is the Danes' money that is being spent. It is therefore the Danish taxpayer's money that has come from a box, which among other things. I'm gonna use it to help people escape. Now we spend this money helping people escape who have come to Denmark. I don't think it's quite as occult as sir. Christian Juhl makes it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151706	Thank you, sir. Marcus Knuth. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Danish People's Party, and that is Mr. Morten Messerschmidt. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315151724	Thank you, President. We are all shocked to see Putin's ruthless behaviour in Ukraine, and we are moved to see the images of cities that we know and to which we could travel until recently, crushed by the Russian war machine. Fifteen years ago, I was sent by the Folketing as an election observer in Kyiv. It was just around the Orange Revolution, and everyone thought that the future would be bright. It was for a while, too, until Putin's madness caught on. In this light, in this situation, we in Denmark must of course reach out and help people who dream of living in a free nation who dream of developing and creating a democracy and who basically want to be allowed to live up to what was established 350 years ago in Europe with the western falsity of peace, which is that every people is allowed to conform to their own will, as long as it does not compromise the freedom of another people. That is what Putin's Russia denies the Ukrainians. That is why we in the Danish People's Party would like to assist the Ukrainians, who hopefully only for a short time it must be hoped that they will not be able to be in their country of origin. We would like to help, including people to get jobs, education and so on. So when we vote yellow in the third reading for this bill, it is by no means due to scepticism or dislike of Ukrainians in Denmark. On the contrary, we have historically had only good experiences with European or, at least, with Christian European refugees in Denmark. Whatever happened to Czechs, Ukrainians or others, the community of values, the community of faith that binds us together in the West, in the Christian world, has made it natural to gain access, whatever it has been to civil society, the labour market or other areas. That is also why it is so sad that we have a government which cannot even say that it is haste, that it is simply political opportunism or cynicism and which has chosen to insist that one cannot vote against making a loophole in the legislation of § 2 for the 2,300 people from the Middle East who are in Ukraine, including their indefinable families, i.e. not indefinable in the material sense, but numerically, without at the same time also voting no to help the Ukrainians. It is a manifestation of arrogance of power to an extent which, as such, only adds to the experience we have had with the government during the Corona period. We really would have liked to have voted in favour of this bill because we want to help Ukrainians, but we do not want to make a huge gap in the Danish alien law for the benefit of Afghans, Syrians and others who may be in Ukraine and who, without any difficulty whatsoever, would be able to enjoy temporary or long-term protection in Poland, Hungary or in other EU countries bordering Ukraine, where they will already have the right of residence with the current legal basis. We do not want to create a hole, as is done in section 2 of the law here, where even intercoursers, children and people who have divided households but who may not even be in Ukraine or in Denmark should be able to apply for legal residence in Denmark. I really think it's a shame. I would say it is disgraceful that at one point a government that prides itself on being a uniting figure and commends itself for having a united Danish population behind it, which backs the Ukrainians, who so much need and deserve that support, and at the other time makes a law that deliberately prevents 179 members of this high-quality thing from voting in favour. We wanted to, and we want to help the Ukrainians, but we do not want to be the subject of this government's cynical game, and that is why we are voting yellow.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315152220	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur comes from New Citizens, and that is Mrs Mette Thiesen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315152239	Thank you. An aggressive and imperialist regime in Moscow has thrown Europe into war. Ukraine, an independent and independent country, has been invaded by Russia. The cities of Ukraine are being bombed from the air, from the sea and from the land by Russian missiles, bombs and grenades. There is nothing invasion is a breach of all principles; the invasion is an expression of a vile rejection of the right of other people to a life of freedom and security; the invasion is a crime. I and New Citizens have no understanding whatsoever of Russia's attack on Ukraine. We do not recognise that Russia should feel threatened by the West, nor that Ukraine's freedom to choose its own allies and its own position in the international community in any way prevents Russians from living safely behind their own borders and trading with the whole world and their country in being a full and recognised member of the international community. Dear Putin, there is no contradiction between Ukrainian freedom and Russia's possibilities, but when you try to subjugate another people by war, conquer another country and steal another people's freedom, you face opposition. And that war is going to lose, I am convinced. The Ukrainians will not be subjugated. They're fighting. And we in the West will not betray them. We support the Ukrainians in their struggle. I do, it does my party, it does a collective parliament, it does the Danes, and it does the Danish business community. Danes and Danish companies have donated about 1 billion. kr. to support over the next three weeks since Russia's invasion. There is an enormous will on the part of the Danes to help. Today, we are dealing first with a law that should make aid to Ukrainian refugees flexible and simple bypassing the normal asylum system. It is an initiative fully in line with the Danes' will to help the Ukrainians, and it is an initiative that we in New Citizens wholeheartedly support. Ukrainian citizens fleeing Putin's bombs should not be parked in an asylum center for months while their case is being dealt with; they should have the opportunity to enter the community; the children should go to school and the adults should get to work as soon as they are ready. When Parliament's parties negotiated an agreement last week, I was prepared, on behalf of the New Citizens, to say yes to all that. Refugees from Ukraine need help, including in Denmark. Here we are fully in line with the government and with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. The Minister has said on several occasions and on the weekends repeated that there must be a difference. We're helping the Ukrainians because they're closer. Their culture, religion, traditions and way of life are associated with us. The minister said in the same context that the government's objective is that there should be zero zero! I and New Citizens fully agree with the Minister on that. It was therefore with great surprise and regret that just as refugees from the Middle East and North Africa were included in the agreement reached by the parties last week, which is the basis of the legislative proposal we are debating today. Why would you do that? Why would migrants from the Middle East and North Africa be allowed into Denmark bypassing the normal asylum system and giving them the right to two years' residence and public support? It's the Ukrainians we need to help now. It is Ukrainians who must have rapid access to school, housing and work. Surely it is not the migrants from the Middle East and North Africa who must have free access to it all. The minister says that the government's objective is zero from Muslim countries, and then it makes no sense to remove all barriers and the normal asylum treatment for that group. Migrants from the Middle East and North Africa should, of course, at least have their asylum applications dealt with in accordance with the rules in force. We all saw that they weren't let in at all, but it's a completely different matter. That is why new citizens are not included in the agreement either, but we would very much like to vote in favour of the law and help the Ukrainians. We therefore propose an amendment at second reading, so that the law applies only to Ukrainian citizens. It is our hope that the government and our friends in the bourgeois opposition will support the amendment so that we can help the Ukrainians without at the same time letting even more migrants from the Middle East and North Africa into a life in Denmark on public support. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315152819	Thank you to the rapporteur of the new citizens. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Liberal Alliance, and that is Mr. Henrik Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315152831	Thank you for the floor. Legislative proposals L 145 are fleeing with the rules that are currently being adopted throughout the European Union, and this stems from the totally criminal Russian attack on Ukraine on 24 February, which has already triggered a wave of refugees to Ukraine's neighbouring countries in the order of 3 million people. We have noted that the bill is based on the rules for Ukrainians that were in force before 24 February; here it was the case that we could easily enter the European Union on a modern Ukrainian chip pass. The draft law also builds on the experience we already have in Denmark with Ukrainians in terms of participation in the labour market and in terms of ability and will and the possibility of integrating into Denmark. Before the war started, around 13,000 Ukrainians lived in Denmark, and they were characterised by having a high participation in the labour market and by falling well around Denmark, where they have found employment, and this is a pattern of behaviour that Bill L 145 supports. It is pragmatic, it is common sense. And that's why L.A. is backing the bill. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153008	Thank you, sir. Henrik Dahl. There are no brief remarks to the Liberal Alliance rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Free Greens, and that is Mr. Sikandar Siddique.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153028	When refugees seek refuge in Denmark, we have a responsibility to protect them. Right now it is Ukraine that is at war, and that is why we must, of course, help Ukrainians flee. They should feel welcome and safe in Denmark. However, it does not matter whether we flee Putin's bombs in Ukraine or Putin's bombs in Syria. A fugitive is a fugitive. Free Greens are opposed to racist legislation. We are opposed to splitting refugees into A and B teams. A fugitive is a fugitive sentence. My colleagues in this House have not hesitated to roll the red carpet off the Ukrainian refugees, and that is only appropriate. I want them to know that they're safe with us, that we take care of them. But I don't understand why the red carpet has been hidden away in recent decades. Where was the red carpet when we welcomed the many refugees who are still sitting in our asylum centres and rotting? Have we forgotten that Denmark was the first country in the world to sign the refugee convention? It is the refugee convention that does not say anything about immediate areas, the refugee convention that makes no distinction between refugees, because a refugee is a refugee. And not only do we discriminate against refugees, the bill for the special law apparently has to be wiped off on the world's poorest countries in Africa. What's going on? One of the richest countries in the world is forcing the poorest to pay for our discrimination. This is totally unacceptable. The justification for the racist special law is based on the fact that Ukraine is our immediate area of activity, a flying concept defined by politicians as necessary. Are we rolling out the red carpet for refugees from Istanbul? It is also in Europe and in our neighbourhood; our neighbours. The answer is obvious: no, because it does not look like the majority. This is a historically low point in Danish politics. It is not because state-racist legislation is being implemented, because it is not the first time, but because it is now happening with the support parties. Although they call the law discriminatory, they are now laying down their own mandates to make an A and a B team. It's a historic black day. We do not want to be part of this in the Greens. We want to help all refugees, and this is of course also true of the Ukrainians, but we will never vote in favour of legislation that gives people different rights depending on where they come from and how they look. For Free Greens, a fugitive is a fugitive. When refugees knock on our door and ask for help, we should roll out the red carpet so that refugees can find their way into our society, work and train themselves and most importantly feel safe. We will treat all refugees with the respect that a person deserves, because that is what makes us human. So we need to help the Ukrainian refugees, but we do not want to make any difference. Free Greens will not divide refugees into an A team and a B team. In other words, this special law is racist waste. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153431	There is a request for a brief comment on Mrs Kathrine Oldag, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153435	Thank you. There has been a rather heated debate in the run-up to the examination of the proposal here and the special law where Mr. Sikandar Siddique among others have called the support parties racist and said that we support a state racist policy. Then I'm just thinking: maybe I'm the one who's historyless, but I'm not thinking of Mrs Rosa Lund or Enhedslisten or SF or Radical Left as parties that promote a racist agenda. So I may need to hear it from the finest platform in the country: Sikandar Siddique, that the government's three supporting parties are racist parties?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153505	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153507	Unlike the rapporteur, who would not answer the question when I put it, I would like to answer the question. The supporting parties are not racist parties, but the supporting parties are helping to support legislation that discriminates. The support parties themselves have been out to say throughout the week that this is discriminatory legislation and that the legislation discriminates, and then you support the proposal. So, unlike before, when the support parties accepted the status quo, Mrs Inger Kjærsgaard's foreign policy, which the government pursued, was accepted by supporting the government, this time it has deliberately entered into a mandate for legislation that discriminates and discriminates. That is what the Greens are pointing out.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153600	Mrs. Kathrine On Saturday.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153602	Let me take a slightly different lead and raise a perhaps a slightly easier question: will the Free Greens help to protect Ukrainian refugees? Free Greens are going to vote against the special law, so it has to be assumed that the Free Greens will not protect Ukrainian refugees. What would the alternative be to a special law? It will be for the Ukrainian refugees to stand in the asylum queue, and with the times of the proceedings that gallop, they may have to wait a few years or more for asylum in Denmark. Is that fair? So the question is: will the Free Greens, at the end of the day, help the Ukrainian refugee? What should we say from the Free Greens when we meet a Ukrainian refugee with children? Are you helping to support their stay in Denmark, or are you not?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153644	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153646	But I think that the rapporteur should start by worrying about what the rapporteur is going to say to the Syrians, who, among other things, are going to do. Because of the Radical Left right now sitting in the asylum centres rotting. What will the rapporteur say to them? What will the rapporteur say to all those people who are currently sitting in our Danish asylum hell and cannot get out and work and whose children are getting sick? What will the rapporteur say to them? What kind of logic is it that because you want to improve something from someone, it's okay to discriminate? What kind of logic is that? At any rate, the Greens can never discriminate against refugees. A fugitive is a fugitive.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153725	The next brief remark is to Mr. Morten Messerschmidt, Dansk Folkeparti. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153729	Thank you, President. Sir. Sikandar Siddique is probably the person I've ever met who cares most about race. Well, sometimes it almost assumes a pathological character, so he feels the urge to talk about people's looks when you talk about different cultures, and that's where I'd just like to think if so, sir. Sikandar Siddique could spend a minute describing what a Muslim looks like.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153754	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153756	This is a very, very populist speech here, which has nothing to do with the matter. With what the rapporteur says clearly from this point of view, which I would also like to give to the rapporteur, he admits at least that it is about cultural differences, that it is about whether you are a Christian or you are a Muslim. For Free Greens, no matter what background you have, whatever religious background you have, no matter what skin color you have, a fugitive is a fugitive. That is what we are fighting for, and that is what we are trying to convince Parliament of. Article 3 of the Refugee Convention states that all refugees must be treated equally, and we are not doing so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153834	Sir. Morten Messerschmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153836	Now we came very far, but unfortunately not just about what I was asking. Well, sir. Sikandar Siddique says that it is the physical characteristics of a human being who, like it is the decisive thing about my views, and therefore he allows himself to say that I am a racist. And there it has to be logical that he also has such a clear understanding of what people look like. Well, I can't look at people whether they're Muslims or if they're Danes. I simply do not have those abilities, I think you should be in Sikandar Siddique's shoes, but it may be that it is too difficult with Muslims, so I try to ask Mr. Siddique. Sikandar Siddique: What does an Ukrainian look like?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153911	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153912	In other words, I have not called the rapporteur racist, but we know that the rapporteur has been convicted of violating the racism clause, and since the rapporteur is now a lawyer, yes, the rapporteur himself has to explain that he is watching per person. definition is racist when you have violated the racism clause. I'm afraid I'm not.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153928	The next brief remark is to Mr. Mads Birded, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153933	I just want to know if the Greens are opposed to the special law for Kosovo Albanians.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153940	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315153942	Free Greens are against all special laws. And with regard to the Kosovo Act, the Kosovo Albanians made their stay outside the asylum system. According to experts, the special law was unnecessary; in fact, it placed Kosovo Albanians at a disadvantage. Generally speaking, we believe that refugees should be treated equally and that special laws should not be made. What we need to do is to improve our general legislation on asylum and refugees.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154007	Sir. Mads Birded.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154010	Now I assume that the answer must be the same to my next question, which means that the Free Greens are also opposed to the special law that was made for the Palestinians in Denmark at the time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154019	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154021	The Palestinians were a small group of rejected asylum seekers and they had fallen outside the system. The two things cannot be compared at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154027	Thank you, sir. Sikandar Siddique. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the alternative, and that is Mr. Torsten Gejl. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154049	Thank you, President. In the alternative, we cannot, under any circumstances, vote in favour of a special law which favours certain war refugees. We can never support legislation that discriminates against refugees on the grounds of their origin and religion, and a law that is rushed through the Folketing with only one day's consultation time... a law that may conflict with Article 3 of the Refugee Convention, which states that the Contracting States must apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without any difference in terms of race, religion or country of origin, a law that is financed through foreign aid by taking money from the poorest people in the world who are always forgotten and who are going to suffer even more from rising food prices. We believe that this special law exhibits 20 years of failed asylum and refugee policy in Denmark, and that it is alien law that needs to be changed, rather than just dispensing from it when there is a group of war refugees for whom we have particular sympathy. The things that need to be changed are, for example, that we should not be able to send refugees back to a president who should be brought before a war criminal court, such as that. are carried out with Syrian refugees. We believe that we should be able to accept people fleeing war and that they should, of course, be allowed to work and train immediately and live a life not a life paused but a life that makes sense. We must have a fair law and not a special law, and that is why the alternative can under no circumstances vote in favour of a law that favours certain refugees and discriminates against others. But that does not mean that we have not had a very lively debate about this special law in the Alternative. Our rational, our brains, our senses forbid us to vote in favour of the special law for the reasons I have mentioned, but we also have hearts in the alternative, and our hearts have infinite difficulty in saying no to support desperate people, especially women and children fleeing from war. We find it incredibly difficult to tell the people who are fleeing for millions that they should not have the opportunities that should apply to all refugees. We simply cannot. That's why the alternative chooses to vote yellow. We are voting for a huge 'no' vote to distribute special refugee groups in the world when so many need help, and we must be honest and say that we doubt that this legislation would have come into being if the Ukrainians had been mainly Muslims, but we are voting in favour of helping the specific war refugees who are fleeing from Putin and the Russian aggression. When you cannot vote both yes and no in the Folketing, you have the yellow button you can press, and the alternative is going to do so in this case. We will also be supporting the amendment from the Enhedslisten, which would like this special law to apply to everyone. Unfortunately, this will not be adopted, so the alternative will, of course, continue to change Danish refugee legislation to be more humane to all war refugees, not least those coming from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where we ourselves have been involved in starting the wars. Thank you, President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154357	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to Mr Seligman. Sikandar Siddique, that Free Green. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154400	Thank you to the rapporteur. We are, after all, a huge minority in this matter, which is why I have called it a historic black day, a historic black day, because the support parties are not, as they used to be, silent about the status quo and, at least, the government is not knocking over the issue of foreigners and refugees, but today it is putting mandates to discriminate. The rapporteur made an important point. I can't remember if it was Mrs. Rosa Lund who was on the platform or if it was Mr. Lund. Carl Valentin, who was on the platform, but I would like to hear whether the rapporteur will clarify the point of what it really means when it is said that our refugee and asylum rules are inadequate and that we must therefore make a special law and that when the support parties support that special law, they are de facto stuck in this inhumane refugee and asylum system. Could the rapporteur elaborate on that part?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154459	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154503	The rapporteur would very much like that. I believe that this situation exhibits our miserable legislation in this area, and that is why it needs to be dispensed with. But that just means that we are giving the government a cat hand to dispense with really bad legislation when it is the case that we find it convenient, and then it does not have to change the legislation itself, because you can only grant dispensations. So I actually believe that we are helping to stamp out a really unfortunate alien law in this way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154538	There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. Thank you, sir. Torsten Gejl from the Alternative. The next is Mrs Marie Krarup, outside the groups.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154555	There is a tragedy taking place in Ukraine. It is a brutal invasion and a relentless war that causes death, distress and suffering. It takes place in an area with which we can call Denmark's proximity, and it affects people with whom we have a cultural community. At the same time, it is a war for which we have a responsibility, because we could have helped prevent it if we had conducted a more well-thought-out foreign policy with our allies. For all these reasons, I believe that Denmark should help Ukrainian refugees as much as possible, and that is why I support the special law on the reception of Ukrainian refugees. However, I would like to make a few comments on the law. Firstly, I would like to clarify whether the future entry of the Ukrainians envisages giving them back-travel assistance, as we do to other refugees. I do not see that from the draft law. I believe, of course, that Ukrainians should be given the same opportunity for support when they return home, when, hopefully, peace has eventually arrived in the country and the country needs to be rebuilt. Secondly, I would suggest that the municipalities be given greater freedom when they are granted refugees so that they can choose for themselves whether to receive Ukrainians or refugees from other countries. I expect to clarify the issues during today's committee reading and possibly to table amendments on both during the day. With regard to the amendments tabled by the K and New Citizens' Group, I will certainly take a positive view of them as well. They want to improve the bill. However, I would like to vote in favour of the bill regardless of whether or not I wish it to be adopted and when I say so, I am speaking on my own behalf, and I am speaking on behalf of Karina Adsbøl, Liselott Blixt, Bent Bøgsted, Hans Kristian Skibby and Lise Bech, all members of parliament outside the groups. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154804	Thank you to Mrs Krarup, outside the groups. All the rapporteurs who wanted to speak have spoken in the round of rapporteurs, and I can give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315154830	Thank you, Mr President. And thank you to the rapporteurs for a good debate, I think, on a legislative proposal that the Folketing has only known for a short time. I have been pleased with a good, qualified political discussion on an important matter and an important legislative proposal. Thursday, February 24, seems like a long time ago. That was the day we woke up to a changed Europe, our continent, a Europe at war. Since the Russian attack on Ukraine on the early Tuesday morning, more than 2.6 million people have been displaced from their homes and the number is increasing day by day. And this is the biggest humanitarian crisis on our continent, in our vicinity, for decades. I believe that we stand with one foot in the biggest integration task this society has ever had. In Denmark, of course, we have a responsibility to help those people who, as a result of Putin's invasion, have been expelled from their homes in Ukraine. It was on this basis that a broad majority of the Danish Parliament's parties concluded an agreement that displaced Ukrainians staying in Denmark should be guaranteed a place of residence in this country so that they can get into society as soon as possible and have a meaningful everyday life, where adults can go to work and children can go to school or day care. Then, nine days later, we will be able to deal first with the bill which will provide the special basis of residence for people who, as a result of the invasion by the Russian armed forces, have been driven out of their country of origin. We must ensure them the best possible conditions to be able to carry on their lives quickly and effectively and actively as part of our society. At the same time, however, the draft law aims to prevent the Danish asylum system from coming under such pressure that we simply cannot keep up with any more, which would result in a significant disadvantage both for the displaced persons from Ukraine and for everyone else who is seeking protection in Denmark. We are currently experiencing the greatest influx of displaced persons in Europe since the Second World War. Last week three new asylum centres opened, and yesterday another one opened and more are on the way. So I cannot stress clearly enough how serious and how violent a situation we are in. The draft law creates the legal basis for granting a residence permit to Ukrainian citizens and persons with refugee status in Ukraine and their accompanying family in Denmark. There has been criticism that people with refugee status in Ukraine are covered by the political agreement on the bill, and to that I can say that when refugees are included, it is in recognition that they do not have a home country to go back to. This is the whole premise of being recognised as refugees, even if recognised by the Ukrainian authorities. On the other hand, others who have a residence permit in Ukraine are not included in the list of main characters of the bill, since, unlike refugees, they can be referred to stay in their country of origin. The draft law provides for the temporary residence permit to be valid until 17 March 2024. As we approach that time, we will need a new debate, because then we will have to decide whether the residence permits should be extended further. And I think we will benefit from doing so in connection with, or in connection with, the corresponding European discussions. The bill also provides for persons applying for a residence permit under the law to be guaranteed a legal stay in Denmark while the case is being dealt with, so that at the same time they will have access to the subsistence and accommodation of the Foreigners' Board, if they so wish. Following the granting of a residence permit under the special law, those concerned will be subject to the rules of the Integration Act; it is the rules that apply to all other refugees who are granted a residence permit in Denmark. They will therefore, if they are not in work and receive a benefit, have offered a programme under the Integration Act and will receive the same effort from the local job centre and the possibility of Danish education. And all this should help them to enter the labour market. I would also like to be honest that with this law we are also introducing what I have called a hand brake, which gives the municipalities a little flexibility in the integration effort. It was part of an agreement concluded by the government with the National Association of Municipalities to ensure on the one hand the housing location of the people who are granted a residence permit, and on the other hand give the municipalities a little more elastic to receive the many Ukrainians if we end up in a situation where a lot of people have to be housed. I would also like to say that we will, of course, try to meet the wishes of the Ukrainians in relation to where they would like to be accommodated in the country, but I would also like to tell you now that there will be examples of Ukrainians who cannot be placed where they want to be. Because we also need to take account of a fairly appropriate geographical distribution, so that it will not be a few local authorities that will have to face up to the whole task of securing, for example. day offers and schools for the children. Finally, I would also like to say that I am pleased that there is broad agreement in the Folketing to help those people who are now driven out of their homes as a result of the conflict with Putin's Russia. And it is therefore also my clear expectation that from the day after tomorrow we can start issuing residence permits under this law. In any case, the authorities are ready; they are in the booth waiting for the Danish Parliament to have the third reading of the bill. I am also well aware that this is an accelerated legislative process, and that is why I am of course at the disposal of both myself and the whole ministry to answer questions, and we shall be careful to ensure that everything is answered as quickly as possible. Thank you for today's debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155442	Thank you, Minister. There are a number of brief comments to be made to the Minister, and the first is from Mr. Marcus Knuth, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155450	Thank you, Minister. I know that this legislation has gone very quickly, but I wanted to know whether the Minister can help with a concern that is in, for example. Elsinore Municipality, in relation to the geographical distribution of Ukrainians. For example: In Elsinore we have received Ukrainians who may now be afraid to be redistributed to Aalborg, although they really want to stay where they are. This is precisely because this law follows the rules governing the normal housing of refugees. So what can be done to ensure that the Ukrainians, who have actually just come to a place where they want to stay, do not run the risk of being forced to live in another part of the country against their wishes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155528	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155530	Thank you. I read the consultation answer well from the municipality of Elsinore and, as I also tried to say in my speech, I think we should try to meet the wishes of Ukrainians. Some have family members who are already in Denmark and for example. working in agriculture, others have a job on hand, and there may also be some who have already established some contacts in Denmark. There may be, for example: be families in Helsingør, who have been volunteers and helped them in the abandoned nursing home, which I know they are accommodated at. When you apply for a stay, as part of the forms you have to complete, there will also be some fields where you can write it if you have some special wishes for housing placement, and of course the authorities will try to comply with that. I would just like now, as I stand on the platform, to give an indication that we are looking into a very violent influx, and if we see some requests from a great many people to be accommodated in a particular municipality, we will also have to take into account that the mayors and municipal councils also have a ceiling on how many municipalities can accommodate. Therefore, there will also be some Ukrainians who get no to be housed right in the municipality where they want it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155636	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155638	I would just like to say thank you to the Minister and I hope that implementation can be as little rigid as possible, precisely because it is a completely different situation with Ukrainians, since many have family members or contacts in Denmark in advance. It was more of a comment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155650	The next brief remark is to Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155700	Thank you so much. I just want to hear the Minister, and I have actually asked about this before, because it is clear that there has also been pressure on Denmark's borders at this time, whether the government has taken the lead in upgrading that effort, so that it is not just sample checks, but that you are simply checking everyone who has to cross the Danish border at this time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155724	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155726	It is still spot checks that have been introduced at the Danish borders, and we have not taken a decision on the control of all those crossing the border. However, I can see that in the last few days of random checks it has been found that 12 000 Ukrainians have crossed the border. It's including people, for example. Ukrainian truck drivers who just drive into Denmark because they have to deliver some goods for, let's say a German trucker. But it is 12,000 Ukrainians based on the sample check, so it tells us something about how many Ukrainians have already entered Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155804	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155807	Thank you so much. But will the government then take the lead in ensuring that it is not just a random check, but that it is a firm check, and then actually reject those who do not have a passport, so that you do not have the opportunity to cross the border? Well, we see at this point, as the Minister himself says, that there is a lot of pressure on the border, and this just having open borders, and people can just drive in, is probably quite inappropriate in the current situation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155833	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155835	We have no plans to implement border controls where everyone is stopped. But it is not a secret that the police are present on the Danish-German border now, and if you meet a third-country citizen who has lived in Ukraine let us say that it is an Indian student who has studied at the University of Kiev and who has fled the bombs and is on the Danish-German border and wants to enter, we say: You cannot enter unless you apply for asylum of course; then you can become part of the Danish asylum system. Some of them have said that they want to go to Sweden and seek asylum, but we have said that they cannot enter Denmark unless they seek asylum in Denmark and they do not want to. That is why there is also traffic with some ferries from, for example. Kiel to Sweden.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155919	The next question is Mr. Morten Messerschmidt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315155920	Thank you, President. This figure, 2.274, we have been talking a little bit about, and I simply cannot quite understand what it is covering up, because it may sound limited immediately compared to 15,000 from Ukraine, etc. But when I am still more concerned that the figure might increase, it is because, as I read the law here, in section 4 paragraph 4. 2 states that an application for a residence permit pursuant to § 2 (2) (a) is to be made on the basis of Article 2 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71. 1 may be administered in Denmark or outside the country. Good. Then you look at section 2, paragraph 2. 1. Who is it? It is then a partner or a child or one who shares the household, not with Ukrainian citizens, but with the refugees who are then in Ukraine and who are presumably the 2,274. This means that couples, children and household dividers with these 2.274 can apply for a residence permit, even if they are outside Denmark. Is that correct? Is that how it's gonna be? Because if you just read the text of the law here, that's the impression you get.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160026	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160026-2	So, either there has to be a marriage, and it has to be concluded by February 24th, or there has to be a co-life. And with cohabitation, it's not enough to be friends on Facebook, so you have to have lived together and established what you normally understand in the sense of the Aliens Act as a cohabitation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160046	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160047	Yes, I understand that, but there are plenty of people who do not live in the same country. And then the minister forgets about the kids. I mean, maybe 16-17-year-old boys are in Syria, for example. If they can then follow and apply for a residence permit in Denmark according to section 4, section 4. 2, if one of their parents, who has had refugee status in Ukraine, then comes to Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160119	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160121	It may be a little thought, but the short and honest answer is that you can make an application for family reunification, even if you are outside Denmark, even if you are staying, let us say, in Egypt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160134	The next question is Mr. Sikandar Siddique. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160136	Thank you to the President and thank you to the Minister. There are bombs in Ukraine. The criminal Putin bombs the Ukrainian people and all those who are in Ukraine. I would like to know why the government is making a special law which applies only to some Ukrainian citizens and only to these 2,400 with refugee status. Why have not those who are permanently resident also been included? Why have the many other people who are there not also been included? Well, bombs fall. And this is not such a situation where you can just say: Well, I from India or Nepal, I'll just get on a plane and go to Nepal. There's a war going on. The bombs don't see who has citizenship and who doesn't. Wouldn't that make any more sense, sir? Minister, would it not make more sense to make legislation that said that everyone who is in Ukraine is, of course, covered by the legislation at the very least?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160239	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160239-2	No. If a student from Nepal is studying at the University of Kyiv and there are actually a lot of people who do, because the Ukrainian universities are recognised, and this is a place where you can take an education cheaply, so there are plenty of citizens from all over the world who are studying at Ukraine's universities. However, when he is staying in Poland, I think it is a task for the Nepalese embassy in Warsaw to help such a Nepalese home to Nepal. It is clear that if he says he does not want to go to Nepal because he fears for his life, if he goes to Nepal, then we have an ordinary asylum system for that. But I simply do not see why such a Nepalese should suddenly have the right to stay in Denmark. I simply do not think that makes any sense. That is why I think it is very sensible, as the draft law says, that the task for third-country nationals, when safe outside Ukraine, is to return to the countries from which they came.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160341	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160342	But Mr. Minister, that is not how it works in a war. Has the Minister not seen all the videos of people who cannot leave the country, people who ask for help, people who ask their home countries for help? That's not how war works. We need to get the humans off that bomb site, no matter where they come from. And wouldn't the Minister agree when we say that we will help the Ukrainians because they have to escape Putin's bombs, but at the same time send Syrians back to Putin's bombs in Syria that it may confuse?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160416	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160417	With all due respect and respect, I do not think the rapporteur's arguments are linked. An Indian student who leaves Ukraine and comes to Poland is not a place where the bombs fall around his ears. Then the Indian student is in Poland. There is no war in Poland. Then the task for the Indian Embassy in Poland is then to help such a student home, just as it would be the task of the Danish Embassy, if there was war somewhere else, to help a Dane home. The job is not that such an Indian student is going to Denmark. What's he doing here for?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160449	The next question is Mrs Rosa Lund from the Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160452	Thank you. In fact, I would like to repeat the question which I put a few hours ago to Mr Van Miert. Rasmus Stoklund, the question of how it can be that the government, the Social Democratic Party, believes that the Danish law on foreigners is good enough for people fleeing Syria, people fleeing Afghanistan, people fleeing Somalia, people who are not good enough for the people fleeing Ukraine. The Minister knows very well that in the Enhedslisten we would have liked to have seen the Danish alien law amended so that it could protect people on the run from Putin, so that we would not have to have this special law, but so that we could secure all people who are fleeing, and I actually still need an answer to that. Why is the Danish alien law good enough for acids, but not for Ukrainians?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160539	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160540	I think that the Danish law on foreigners is good, otherwise I would make proposals to amend it. For me, the most important argument for this special law is that if Denmark and other European countries do not put forward this type of legislation, the European asylum systems would de facto collapse together. We usually get a handful of people knocking on up in Sandholm every day and saying "asyl·." Now there's buses coming in. If we do not deal very quickly with their applications for a residence permit under this special law and get them into the municipalities really quickly, then we simply cannot open enough asylum centres in Denmark to accommodate all the many people, and that would make the processing times of all foreigners seeking asylum extended for a very, very long time, and we would have to spend excessive amounts of resources on lawyers and interpreters for whom we already have a waiting time. Denmark has an asylum system that is reasonably well run. I believe that the Belgian, Dutch, Austrian and many asylum systems will collapse completely. So what we're doing is we're saying that all those who come from this limited conflict that's driven by it can get a residence permit under this special law, and then the normal asylum system can run in parallel with a reasonable processing time and a fair access to interpreters and lawyers and accommodation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160655	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160655-2	But the European asylum system has collapsed, Minister. If you look at Greece, if you look at Spain, which are the ones that currently have the external borders and take all refugees from Syria, they would say that the asylum system has collapsed. I have heard the Minister say this before. When we made proposals in the Enhedslisten that some children should be taken from the Greek refugee camps at Lesbos, the Minister said that the European asylum system has collapsed; we cannot do anything. Now, as an argument for this special law, the minister says that the special law must be made so that the system does not collapse. So, can the Minister not see that we have a huge responsibility, including in Denmark, to help people from Syria?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160743	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160744	I believe that the European asylum system is morally and politically collapsed, but that does not mean that it does not work logistically and practically. People knocking on the door in Sandholm get a bed, three meals food, an interpreter, a lawyer; an asylum case runs. It works as it should under the law. I just believe that it cannot be argued morally and politically that this is connected. Now you should never paint the hell on the wall; I just want to say that it is very, very violent what is going on in Europe, and it is also going on in Denmark. It is a refugee disaster that we have never seen before in our asylum system, and that is also why I appeal to us to adopt this legislation and to do everything we can, wherever we are in the Assembly Chamber, to make this work, because otherwise we will have real problems in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160835	The next question is Mrs Kathrine Ollldag from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160838	Thank you. I would like to start by congratulating the Minister and the Ministry for putting forward a proposal for a special law that is so close to the EU directive. It is at the heart of the Radical Left that Ukrainian refugees experience something like the same when they move through European countries. That being said, we of course find it very, very problematic that the government is going to fund this with development funds, despite the fact that this is something we have done since 2015 or not. Could it not be imagined, if we now actually provide some other alternatives, that the government and the minister were open to looking at some funding proposals that did not just hollow out development aid in this way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160924	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315160924-2	As the Minister for Development has also presented, it is government policy that we should finance this group of displaced people from Ukraine in the same way that we would normally finance the first year of refugee reception. So that will be the position and starting point of the government. Of course, you can always come into the minority and be forced to do something else, but that will be our starting point. I also think it is important to maintain that the framework for development policy has grown in recent years because Denmark's GDP has grown. Quite a few years ago, when I was elected to Parliament in 2015, I think it was over 2 billion. kr., maybe more than 3 billion. kr. of the development framework used for refugee reception here in Denmark. It has been so razed down in recent years because fewer asylum seekers have arrived, but now the number is on its way up again. In this way, there is a connection between how many people are seeking asylum here and how much money we can spend out there in the big world, and I think it is good that we have that connection.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161023	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161024	I just can't quite follow the context, because the thing about helping out in the world doesn't have to rule out our help at home or the other way around. It's not a either or not, it's a boat and for the Radical Left. We have looked at it, and there are actually still quite a lot of unspent coronas. There are also quite a lot of unspent funds in the 2022 agreement for the national compromise. So could it not be imagined that in 2022, at least in a pragmatic way, we could go out and find the funds in some places other than taking them from the world's poorest countries?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161058	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161058-2	Our starting point is that we must follow the practice that has actually been in place for a number of years. It is true that it was sharpened in the context of the refugee crisis in 2014-15, but it really goes back a long time. It is clear that if you do not have that funding, there must be someone else. So no matter how you turn and turn it, it's gonna hurt somewhere. There, we think there is good sense in saying that when we have low asylum rates, it hardly affects the development framework, and when we have high asylum rates, that is where we fund it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161137	The next question is Mr. Carl Valentin of the SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161139	When the Minister talks about the refugee situation we are facing, he uses words such as: we have never seen anything like it. I share that concern and I think it is going to be very violent, which is why I am so pleased that we have acted quickly and decisively in securing this special law. But I also get very worried about our development funds when we are in such a comprehensive situation and there can be so many people coming to Denmark. We are going to spend money from there and channel money that would otherwise have gone to poor countries, development organisations, into Danish refugee reception. Can the Minister not open up the possibility that the government will look in the direction of reducing the amount spent on development aid without being forced to do so by a majority of the people? The Minister says that one can of course be forced to do so by a majority of parties. Yes, you could also go along with your parliamentary basis and see if you could find a compromise. Could the Minister not open the door to this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161238	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161239	To the end, I would like to say that I am just telling you what the government's policy is, and I am a politician, just like Mr. Carl Valentin is. I can count to 90, which is why, of course, I am aware of where the majority is in the Chamber and if we can get our policy through, I find it difficult to see anything other than that we will, of course, pursue it. That said, in this draft law there is a calculation technical prerequisite called 20,000. If that figure gets much higher, I am quite convinced that there will be an economic discussion that we are going to take with each other again, because if this is really going to run off and get really violent, it is quite different figures that we are going to talk about. What we are talking about today would be a discussion we had hoped and would miss. It can be really, really violent, and then I do not think it will be the last economic discussion we have with each other. I would also like to say that the development framework is, after all, one of the few areas of the budget law that is automatically growing as a result of bnp growing. In all other areas of our society, including care for the elderly and all sorts of things, you fight from 25 cents to 25 cents to ensure a proper level of service. So now it is the development framework that must stand up to. For many years, because of the low number of asylum seekers, there has been virtually a full record of development policy, and virtually 0.7 per cent have been used. of our bni. I think that's just part of the story.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161401	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161402	I hope that the government is not just going to try to count to 90 and then say: then we will take all the funds from development aid and move over here. I really hope that the government will be willing to look a little at the support parties and how much we actually care about this issue and how worried we are that money is being moved from some of the most vulnerable people in the world. If you just have a tiny utilitarist in your stomach, I think you can see that it is quite problematic, although it is of course good that we help some Ukrainians that a large part of the funds then come from some very vulnerable people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161437	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161439	It is a well-known disagreement, which is also between the Social Democratic Party and the SF, about whether to finance the first part of refugee reception of development funds. It was there a year ago, and it's there today. I would also just like to say that if we had not had a special law and all the Ukrainians were to seek asylum, the first year of refugee reception would also have gone from the development framework. I even think that even more money would have been spent, because longer accommodation is needed if it were asylum seekers. So, in reality, I believe that this special law helps to reduce the amount of money needed by the development framework, because we are getting people out of the housing system quickly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161519	Thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Integration. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161542	The debate is open. The first speaker is Mr. Kasper Roug for the Social Democrats. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161548	Thank you for that, President. Unfortunately, every year we see thousands of Danes dying prematurely or dying as a result of air pollution. Some of the main sources of air pollution are traffic and, for example, wood-burning furnaces. This is serious, and that is why we have also reached a political agreement with the support parties in September 2021 on environmental initiatives in green cities and a capital in development. We have made that, among other things. Because we want green cities. We do not only want green cities where we have to be nervous about the air we breathe; we actually want some green cities where we can breathe freely. With this bill, we would like to allow municipalities to ban older wood-burning ovens and fireplace inserts produced before June 2008, and this must be done in areas where there is district heating and natural gas and access to it. It is the older wood stoves that are estimated to have the largest particle contamination, and therefore this effort must of course also be there. This step must be added to a change of ownership, which we have already adopted, in which a new owner of a home with a wood stove that is before the year 2003 has to replace it. As you know, the scheme entered into force in August 2021. For a lot of people, a wood stove or a fireplace is a well-known source of heat in their everyday lives, but it makes a difference to air pollution, how old the wood stove or fireplace is, and the newer the wood stove or fireplace is, the better it is for combustion and thus also the particulate emissions. In the future, fewer people will have to suffer from air pollution, and with the legislative proposal that we are putting forward here, we will come closer to that goal. That is why the Social Democratic Party supports the bill. And I have to say from the Radical Left that they also support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161756	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is from the SF, and I assume that it is Mr. Rasmus Nordqvist. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161817	Thank you. And thank you to my Socialist colleague for looking very carefully at what this is all about. This is, after all, the implementation of the agreement we made, which is intended to ensure less pollution in cities and, in particular, that we are seriously complying with the EU directives, among other things. The NEC directive to which we are committed. And that's where these particles from the old wood-burning furnaces are extremely important. So it's nice that we finally get this agreement done, so we're gonna have the law that gives this authority so that the municipalities can take these steps. We would, of course, like to see many more environmental and zero-emission zones around the cities, especially where you live closely, because we can only see how much air pollution costs from the lives of citizens living in cities. So, of course, we fully support the agreement that we ourselves have been involved in making.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161915	Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There are no brief comments. We shall then go back to the rapporteur's list and give the floor to Mr Beazley. Jacob Jensen from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315161928	I am grateful to the President and sorry I was just five seconds late. It just went a little fast. But thank you for the floor. I cannot say, then, that I have heard the introduction of the Socialist rapporteur, but it was probably good enough for the time it used to be when we have these wood-burning furnaces. This is not the first time we have this discussion. That is why I can also say that we in the Left are positive about giving municipalities an opportunity to look at these kilns from before 2008, because there is no doubt that it is the oldest kilns that have the greatest problems in relation to particle pollution, as the SF's rapporteur also mentioned a challenge in many places, not least in the more densely built-up areas. Cleaner air is also equal to higher quality of life and better public health, and that is, of course, absolutely central, I think, for all of us. So the fact that it will be an opportunity is very important to us, because there are, of course, differences from, you might say, the larger urban areas with the greater concentration, and then perhaps out in those parts of the country where there are longer between the individual houses and thus also the individual wood stoves. So the flexibility of municipal self-government is something that we in the Left, as we know, have high regard for. So, on the basis of this initiative, I would like to take a fairly positive view, but we do of course have some questions which we would also like to clarify in committee, for example, that we have already setup a setup on change of ownership. There is a setup also purely administrative about it; you know that. Now you have to make a new setup, and whether that is the smartest way to do it, I don't know, for how in relation to wood stove owners, who are then going to get an extra cost • it can be in the order of perhaps 10,000-20,000 kr. or so by being forced if there is a municipality that chooses to use this option? Is it up to us to create some subsidy opportunities or some compensation opportunities or other for those people, as we at least on the Left do not want it to be more expensive to be a Dane? How in relation to the municipalities? You also have to manage this task, as it is being proposed here. It will also require something, and is it intended to compensate the municipalities in some sense? How many municipalities are they expecting? It is not certain that you have been out asking them all, but it may be that you have a feeling of it. Well, what kind of size are we talking about, what kind of effect do you expect to get out of this? It is also one of the things we attach great importance to, that is, that we have an effect on the efforts that are being made so that we do not, if we may say so, go in the wrong direction and spend a massive administrative gunpowder on something that may give a modest or even no effect. And what if you don't live up to this? Is it a duty to report as a citizen, and if you do not live up to it, what kind of sanction can you expect? So of course there are some different questions, and now I have asked them here, and then it may be someone who will reflect on it. Otherwise, we will certainly put them in committee and then we will have to see how the answers are in this context. However, as I said, we are positive as the proposal stands and look forward to having it discussed in greater detail in committee.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315162247	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is from the Enhedslisten. It's sir. Henning Hylllested today, I guess. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315162311	Thank you. Yes, some tremendous leaps are being made in the rapporteur's line, but don't worry about it. As has already been explained, this draft law stems from an agreement that we have between the government and the supporting parties, on green cities and a capital in development, as it is called. It is the intention of the draft law that municipalities should be authorised to require the replacement or decommissioning of wood-burning furnaces in areas heated by district heating or natural gas, and this applies to wood-burning furnaces installed before 1 June 2008. That is all very well; it is a step in the right direction, albeit a small step in our view. This will be of particular importance for the larger urban areas, with district heating and natural gas, and perhaps in real terms, especially Copenhagen. One might say, could we not do a little better? Couldn't we go a little further? We couldn't do that with this deal. It seems that at times we also apply to the parts of the agreement we have dealt with in the past, to zero-emission zones and environmental zones, etc. And that's what we're dealing with. From Enhedslisten's side, we are pushing for a slightly faster pace on this, but as I said, it is a step in the right direction... a small step... so of course we will vote for that in the end. In view of the fact that there are approx. 700,000 wood-burning furnaces in this country, of which 55%. It is true that we are in urban areas, but perhaps we think that we could have taken a little more steps. However, we have chosen not to do this with this agreement and, as I have said, we are voting in favour of the proposal. After all, we also note that the draft law includes the possibility of a later extension and tightening up of some of these provisions and requirements for installation time. And we have to assume that it will be wood-burning furnaces that are installed later than 1 June 2008, and we must also expect stricter requirements for discharges, at least as far as I can read it out of the comments, and also that we will have the possibility of geographical expansion, so that it will also be areas other than those which have the possibility of district heating and natural gas heating, and thus we will also move outside urban areas. We would like to see that; it would be a very good step. It has already been explained how big a problem it is with wood-burning furnaces and how huge a health problem it is with particle emissions from wood-burning furnaces. So, with these comments, I can say that we are voting in favour of the draft law.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315162621	Thank you to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mona Juul of the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315162641	Thank you for the floor. After all, there is nothing more cozy than to light up, read a book and drink a cup of hot cocoa there in the stove. A lot of people do that in Denmark too. We're having a good time. But the air pollution from the about 700,000 wood stoves and fireplaces emits a lot and actually amounts to as much as 40 per cent. of our national particle contamination, which overall is only approx. Twenty-five per cent, since the rest, unfortunately, comes from abroad. In fact, every year about 400 Danes die because of pollution from our wood stoves, and then it's kind of not so cozy. That is also why we have committed ourselves to reducing particulate emissions by 55%. in 2030 compared to 2005. That is the human and environmental part of it. If we look at the economic part, this bill alone, if all the municipalities joined it, will yield a total socio-economic gain of up to 4 billion. DKr. 2040 due to fewer deaths, fewer admissions and fewer sick days. That's what the bill itself says. So why not just get started? However, I have some doubts about some of the figures on which the bill is based. These are very uncertain estimates. How much does this law give in relation to our reduction targets at all, if we challenge it in terms of achieving our goals; what is the overall plan? Because that is one of the arguments being used. Of course, we also need to have a discussion that this all other equal consideration, many legislative proposals at present. has a way of practicing. For example, how many people die? A year because of a lack of cozyness? If each time we look at things in isolation, we might as well ban sugar, cigarettes and alcohol, and I understand that some people would like to ban cigarettes already now. But what about the stress? Can't people just stop doing that, because it costs on the bottom line too? Come on, stop banging me. At the same time, it is a mess with different rules from municipality to municipality, because where are the limits really going? The change of ownership is probably also sufficient to achieve the desired environmental objectives. If it is too lax, we should look at adjusting it instead of introducing another system, for example. look at some incentives to switch as a different way of achieving health and environmental effects rather than prohibited, prohibited, prohibited. We want to help look at the changes, always. So if we are to be convinced to vote in favour in committee, we also need to have more clear answers as to what the impact of this legislation really is and what it will contribute in relation to our reduction targets for particulate emissions. Finally, I also think it is important to mention in the time we are in now that, since the agreement was concluded, we are at a time when we may need to get fired up in the wood stoves to keep warm, and this is a time when we cannot necessarily afford to replace the wood stove. Perhaps the parties to the agreement should reconsider the date of entry into force on 1 July of this year. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315162938	Thank you to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315162951	Thank you. The draft law, L 141, provides for the possibility for municipalities to adopt rules on the replacement or decommissioning of certain combustion plants in certain geographical areas. It is, of course, a question of wood-burning furnaces. The aim is then to improve air quality and reduce particulate pollution from the combustion furnaces. The government then wants to implement this with a ban on wood stoves. We do not agree with that. It is intended that the first implementation of the authorisation will be used only to include wood stoves and fireplace inserts installed by 1 June 2008 in areas with district heating or natural gas for individual heating purposes. But with the price increases we see right now in gas and in several places on district heating, we in the Danish People's Party think that it is almost kicking someone who is lying down. I mean, our electricity and heat prices go up, and then the government wants to go in and ban wood stoves. It's not really connected at all. Many Danes are holding up their economy in these days because they are fortunate enough to have a supplement in the form of their wood stove. The draft law complements the change of ownership scheme, which entered into force on 1 August 2021, which implies an obligation to replace or eliminate wood-burning furnaces and fireplaces produced from 2003 when land-changing. The change of ownership regulation is a national initiative, and it is a measure that replaces many wood stoves, which will thus become more environmentally friendly. But this bill, L 141, is against the Danish People's Party. In relation to the situation we are in right now, it is totally misplaced. Is the government not aware that we are in the midst of an energy crisis right now, when the furnaces are a rescue for a great many people who cannot afford the heat sources that are rising so much? So DF cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315163158	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no brief comments. That was the last ordinary speaker in the rapporteur's line, and so we give the floor to the Minister for the Environment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315163214	First of all, thank you for the positive reception of the draft law in this Chamber today. The background is, of course, that far too many Danes today die prematurely or become ill due to air pollution. That is why we have a duty both as a government and as a Parliament to take action against it. With the bill, we are giving municipalities the opportunity to combat air pollution from wood stoves locally. We are doing this in concrete terms by giving the municipality the opportunity to ban old wood stoves installed before June 2008 in areas where there is district heating or natural gas. According to the WHO, air pollution is one of the greatest environmental and health challenges we face today. It is particularly fine particles that cause cases of illness and premature death. At the same time, Denmark is challenged to achieve the reduction targets for particulate matter in the NEC directive on national emission targets. About 75%. We are not in control of the air pollution we have in Denmark. It blows here from abroad, but the last 25 percent. of air pollution in Denmark comes from Danish sources, and that is among other things. from wood-burning furnaces, cars, industry and agriculture. Air pollution and particulate emissions from wood stoves in Denmark have been decreasing for many years, and this is due, among other things, to. environmental requirements in 2008 for new wood-burning furnaces, which bring significant environmental benefits in line with the ongoing renewal of the wood-burning furnace stock. But air pollution must go even further down. With the proposal, as I said, we allow municipalities to take local steps to combat the negative health effects of air pollution and to improve local air quality. The municipalities wishing to do so will have the opportunity to ban wood-burning furnaces installed before June 2008, i.e. the old wood-burning furnaces, which we know are the most polluting, in areas where district heating or natural gas is precisely involved. It may then be possible to lay down the wood stove without establishing a new source of heat, but it is also possible to switch to a new wood stove with a much lower emission and better use of fuels. The draft law is based on the change of ownership scheme, which came into force last year, which means that before 2003 wood kilns will have to be replaced by change of ownership. So this is something that's added. In the vast majority of cases, it will be easy for citizens to decide whether they are subject to the requirement here, if the municipality decides, because after 2008 all stoves must meet different environmental requirements when installing and have it documented by what is called a test certificate. We're talking about that approx. 55% of the country's 700,000 wood ovens are in areas with district heating or natural gas. There is also a built-in dynamic in the bill. The authorisation shall provide for the possibility to include several types of combustion plants, to tighten up the year of installation or to establish a direct particulate emission requirement if it is considered necessary for the environment or health or if it is deemed necessary for the fulfilment of Denmark's Union or international obligations. Of course, the possibility of a municipal ban on the most polluting furnaces does not solve all the problems. That is one of the things that has been part of the debate. However, this is an important step towards cleaner air, and I would therefore also like to sign up for good cooperation with the parties that have agreed to do exactly that here, but there are also a number of other initiatives in this agreement specifically aimed at combating the air pollution that we also have a responsibility to combat in the Folketing. That is why I am extremely pleased with this proposal. The effect, which has been asked, will depend on how many municipalities ultimately decide to join. Together with the effect of the change of ownership that applies throughout the country, we have two important initiatives here to get cleaner air, while at the same time contributing to our international commitments. In relation to what is being said by the Danish People's Party, I would say that it is precisely at a time like this that we must also ensure, if even more people use a wood stove, that they do not use one that pollutes significantly more than five times more than some of the newer wood stoves. That is why I think there is every reason why we should put this in place. I also think it is important to look at the bill and see that with the phasing-in, we are talking about 2024. That is why it is quite reasonable both for the sake of all those who use wood stoves as heating, but also for the sake of their health. The bill therefore gives us more focus on combating air pollution, both in large cities and on the villa roads, where air pollution can be quite so bad. That's why it's a step towards cleaner air to really a lot of Danes. I look forward to the further consideration of the draft law in committee and also to the consideration of some of the other questions that have been raised. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315163736	Thank you to the Minister for the Environment. There are no brief comments as no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on the Environment and Food and, if no one objects, I consider this to be adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315163800	The debate is open. The first rapporteur is Mrs Camilla Fabricius from the Socialists. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315163815	Thank you, sir. President. Thank you for the floor. I've just been looking forward to this bill basically. This is not because it is brand-new, but because it is based on a really good agreement on the payment of the reserve that we made back in November. I have also been delighted because the experiment is basically based on what the social area is all about: those who are socially at risk and those who we work for must have better quality of life and more co-determination. Because we believe that people are growing under responsibility, and this is going to happen by turning the division of roles in relation to the municipality on their head, and then giving citizens the right to determine what they want and what they have achieved. Then I'm really happy for another reason too. If you look a little and do a few google searches, you can see that this is also called the Aarhus model, and for such a Bundaarhusian jyde as me it is therefore a pleasure as a member of the Danish Parliament to stand here with a very good bill by a very good minister, who precisely offers the possibility that we can now again make a pool of money so that the municipalities can seek money and so that we can include even more experiences. Because without the bill, you can't translate this pool, and then the municipalities can't apply from it, and then the different types of activities can't be done for the citizens that are necessary for their very case to be turned upside down. The municipalities that have already become acquainted with it state that this makes a real difference. There are people who have been given a computer that has received a course or who have been given a driving licence and thus have been able to cope with themselves again. When I have come down to the Needle Park close to the Skraldecafé in Aarhus and have looked at what a difference that personal citizens' budgets have made, I have to say that we are dealing here with a change to the law that actually gives people a direct opportunity. So the Social Democrats, with applause and a great deal of fuss, can say yes to the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164052	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur for both the speech and the cleaning of the speaker desk. Then it is Mrs Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164110	Thank you for that and thank you for the floor, President. Today, we are dealing first with a legislative proposal that translates parts of the agreement on the reserve into social, health and labour market measures for 2022. It is a bill that intends to carry out experiments on personalised citizen-led budgets for vulnerable citizens with special social problems combined with other social support. That is welcome, because it is an agreement that we in the Left are very pleased about. Although we are a broad majority of parties behind the agreement, and also a broad majority in favour of the legislative proposal in this Chamber today, the whole philosophy behind personal citizen-led budgets is, after all, a classic liberal agenda. Let me explain why. For the Left, social security is at the heart of the social policy we are pursuing. The prerequisite for social security is that anyone who can support himself should do so. The truth is that not everyone can support themselves without a little help. That is why, as a society, we also bear responsibility for helping our most vulnerable citizens on the way forward in life. For the Left, it is essential that we provide help in respect for the individual, but at the same time it also means that we demand that aid is designed so that the citizen feels a personal responsibility and has the incentive to get himself out of his social situation. That is why I am pleased that the agreement will enable us to give our society's most vulnerable citizens the opportunity to take an active part in the work of achieving their wishes and their goals in life. It is about giving people the opportunity for some of the most essential things in life, namely to create value in their own life and everyday life. This is best done through greater self-determination, rehabilitation and, above all, quality of life. That is why it is only self-evident that the personalised budget project must continue. With the 2017 rate pool, a similar experiment was carried out with personalised citizen-led budgets in four municipalities, and the results are quite remarkable. In the report of the Danish Social Protection Agency, we see, among other things, that experience shows that almost one out of every four of the citizens considers that they have achieved their long-term goals during the course of the effort, while about half of the citizens consider that they have come closer to achieving their long-term goals through the efforts. In addition, experience also shows that cooperation between the citizen and the support person has been strengthened, which has had a significant impact on efforts and success. Overall, experience shows that personal citizen-led budgets help vulnerable citizens significantly closer to their dreams and goals, while at the same time experiencing a higher degree of self-determination and quality of life. That is why, of course, we in the Left are very pleased that today we can give even more vulnerable citizens the opportunity to have a personalised citizen-led budget and thus also give them the opportunity to have a better life with even greater self-determination and, above all, quality of life. Finally, I would just like to say that I welcome the fact that we once again concluded an SSA agreement with many good elements and initiatives aimed at creating noticeable differences for vulnerable people. They're finally going to work, and I can't wait to see that. I look forward to seeing what differences we can create for vulnerable citizens. It is, in fact, social policy that is battling. For the sake of good order, I would also like to say in the end that we naturally support the draft law. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164428	Thank you very much to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Trine Torp of the SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164437	Thank you for the floor, and thank you to the Minister for presenting this proposal. SF is part of the political agreement behind this bill and, of course, strongly supports it. We are quite positive about this bill and believe that there is a huge potential in the use of citizen-led budgets combined with social support from the municipality to support citizens' self-determination, rehabilitation and quality of life. In fact, we already know this from the previous experiment, where there was a very positive collection of experience. In the past, the SF has also tabled motions for resolutions on the spread of citizen-led budgets in the municipalities for the purpose of helping job-ready cash benefit recipients, including: in the light of the good experiences that the Socialist rapporteur also mentioned, from Aarhus, where more people have found their way out of unemployment through their own judgment. This is, in fact, an example of some of what I hope can be extended even further into our social policy. If we are to have citizens back to an active life where they experience the driving force behind the changes that are necessary for them, but also to be able to set their own goals according to the wishes they may have and the knowledge that they have from their own lives, then we can ensure that the efforts that are being set in motion are actually also relevant to the individual citizen. For citizens, experts are in their own lives, and we can only profit from that knowledge if the municipality meets them with an outstretched hand and an open approach to the wishes they may have. So we therefore hope that in the future we will see even more of these initiatives in which the approach to the citizen is turned a little upside down. Therefore, as the Social Affairs Council calls for in the consultation answer, we also think it would be interesting to start looking at how personal budgets could be disseminated and become a fixed element in the social policy toolbox in all municipalities. The deep plate has been invented, so let us focus on the good experiences and have a look at how they can be disseminated. The SF supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164655	Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Christina Thorholm from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164705	Thank you. Better opportunities for the most vulnerable people to find a foothold are the subject of this bill, and the Radicals are pleased about this, and we agree with the draft law, which gives particularly socially vulnerable people more freedom of action with their own budget. We found the money in the negotiations on the reserve because it is important to continue the support system with personalised citizens' budgets. A personal budget allows for an amount of up to DKK 50,000. for a period of 15 months. It is quite a great freedom to decide what the money is to be used for, and we have emphasised that it creates quality of life and capacity for action. The evaluation from the four municipalities who participated in the first part of the experiment showed this. Experience has shown that the amount was spent on education, employment, better housing and that citizens achieved their long-term goals. Other rapporteurs have explained that almost one in four citizens consider that they have achieved their long-term goals, and half consider that they have continually come closer to their long-term goals. It is also about the link between the money they have received and the cooperation with the municipality, where they have more experience of self-determination. The cooperation between citizens and supporting persons is of great importance in terms of its implementation. Money is also set aside for an evaluation which is important, because when we launch new initiatives it is important to follow it up. We see time and time again that we do not know enough about the social area, so that money has been set aside to look at how the effort is working, is important for the Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164905	Thank you very much to the radical rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Pernille Skipper from the Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315164916	Thank you. There are several rapporteurs who have already noticed from the platform the good experiences of the experiments, who have spoken very warmly about the approach that permeates the project of citizen-led budgets, namely that you meet people with confidence, that you believe that they want and can do something, and then it turns out that they can. Giving people the opportunity to be masters of their own lives means that most people are not just waking up to deeds, but that they are also shining much more than they would otherwise, and I really think that, in addition to agreeing with the good arguments for implementing this bill, I would remind you that that approach should perhaps permeate a greater part of our employment system. It's probably very significant that this experiment is only about people who are in the target group of what is called Section 5 of the Service Act, who are the most vulnerable, who are people in abuse, in homelessness, violent people, people who otherwise need housing support or who live on housing offers. I mean, it's the most vulnerable, but why is it that everyone else who is unemployed, who is on the edge of the labour market, is falling into an employment system that has a completely different approach, that is to say to meet people with distrust, think that they are just there to pee at the system, that cash benefits are probably something you think is fun to be on that you like to lie at home on the couch? All of us sitting in here today, from one end of the room to the other end of the room, are, of course, telling each other that that approach just destroys people and that people, if we meet them with confidence and some control over their own lives, can actually do much more. Why is it that it is only with this most vulnerable group that we have that approach? I think we should ask ourselves and each other about that. In addition, I would just like to thank Mr. Torsten Gejl and the alternative to so persistently hang on to this. It is not because there are not other parties who think that it has been good to have supported Mr. Torsten Gejl along the way I myself will be proud to be one of those who has done it but it is certainly one of your merits, and I hope that this attempt will not only be permanentized, but that it will also put a wedge into the employment system that meets people with too much mistrust. So thank you for that and, of course, Enhedslisten supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165159	Thank you to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165206	Thank you. The bill here translates parts of the reserve agreement that we negotiated in the autumn. Here the parties behind the agreement decided that personalised citizen-led budgets should be made available for socially vulnerable citizens in selected municipalities. The aim of the attempt is to offer citizens with special social problems a personal budget, combined with social support, with a view to supporting the citizen to a greater degree of self-determination and co-responsibility for his own life situation. Personalised citizen-led budgets for socially disadvantaged people are seen among other things. good results in England. The Conservative People's Party is in the agreement and supports the bill, and we will follow the experiment with great interest. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165302	Thank you to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165319	Thank you very much. The draft law is part of the opinion on the mobilisation of the reserve for measures in the social, health and labour market field 2022-2025 and it allows municipalities to help people in what I would say is a nicely different and more personal way than this usual cash-flow-thinking, which we often see. People who find it difficult to control their finances usually have other challenges too, and here you both go in and help them make budgets and combine it with personal support, so that you can look at different aspects of the citizen's life. I guess you could say that this could be a kind of all-round mentor that can help to see the potential of the citizen and that can help lead the person a little on the way. I believe that we are all dreaming of a society in which we help those who are in difficulty in a warm and personal way, where the whole of the citizen's life is at the heart and where people's forces are being found and where they are being supported in their personal development. People grow when they achieve a high degree of self-determination, and we believe that the bill is a good step in the right direction towards the society we dream of, where we meet people who are having difficulty, at eye level, and where we help them grow from where they stand, instead of being just a matter with the municipality. So in the Danish People's Party we can support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165509	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no brief comments. The next speaker is Mrs Mette Thiesen from New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165529	Thank you. All of you rapporteurs who have been up here on the platform have explained very well what this bill is all about. In New Citizens we are very much in favour of vulnerable citizens being more masters of their own lives. We have among other things. a disability policy which specifically states that the area of disability must leave the municipalities and that people with disabilities must be given the opportunity to adapt as they wish to do, far more than they have the opportunity to do today. So, of course, we can also support this bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165603	Thank you very much to the rapporteur of the new citizens. There are no brief comments. The next speaker is Mr. Torsten Gejl from the Alternativet • the ninth participant of the debate and the first master.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315165615	Thank you, President-in-Office and what a gentleman! I am just so happy when Mrs Pernille Skipper from the Enhedslist remembers to say that it is actually the alternative that started to fight for this idea in her time, and even more pleased with the praise that the proposal gets from the rapporteurs in the Danish Parliament and a huge thanks to them for supporting it and still backing it. It's about personal citizen-led budgets. It is a proposal that makes it possible to make $50,000. available to vulnerable Danes that they can use to restart their lives. It may be that they need new teeth or psychological help or advice for a deposit or other things that are essential for them to get on their feet again and into the community of society. The experiment has been run once before with good results, and now we are running it again in order to document the results so clearly that the experiment may be made permanent, so that the Danish municipalities can be allowed to generally offer their vulnerable citizens and hopefully many other personal budgets to kickstart their lives. The first time we ran the experiment was with the past wager pool, and I should like to say that it was not so easy to gather support for the project. There were rapporteurs who looked at me and said: Do you think I can convince my hinterland that we should give vulnerable Danes $50,000? Just like that? After all, the rapporteurs were also receptive to good arguments, and fortunately there were enough of them. In the alternative, we have got the idea of personalised civilised budgets from England, where all municipalities today have to work with personal budgets too vulnerable. One of these projects, which led them to introduce it generally in England, came from London and involved 13 homeless people, some of whom had lived on the street for more than 40 years. Here a charitable organization decided to give each of the 13 homeless £3,000 that they could use as they wanted. They had to choose for themselves whether to make use of the advice offered, but there was one requirement, namely that they answered the question: What do you think is best for you right now? It turned out that none of them spent money on drugs, alcohol or gambling. They were even quite modest and had spent an average of only £800 after a year. Yet the result was amazingly good. After just a year, 11 of them had roofs over their heads, several were in education, in rehab, they visited their families, and most importantly: they made plans for the future. They had their hopes back. With that experience in my back, I managed to get a majority in favour of an attempt on personal civilized budgets of 50,000 DKK. in Denmark. And no, it's not about giving a $50,000 bill. to a homeless person and then just say, "Good luck." It's about a skilled social front worker sitting on the bench next to the victim and explaining to him that he can get 50,000 kroner. made available to solve its problems and challenges with a view to getting on their feet and back into society, re-establishing contact with their families, getting roofs over their heads, getting a job, etc. This has now been done from 2017-2019 in four Danish municipalities, where just over 100 Danes have been allocated 50,000 DKK. available to address their challenges. The participants, together with the supporting persons, have defined a long-term objective of the effort and have subsequently worked for 12 months to achieve that objective. The results can be read about in a report from the Social Protection Agency, which is called "Personal Citizen-led budgets for socially disadvantaged citizens" • It is 28 pages, so I don't have time to read it here at all. So I will confine myself to saying that the experience of this shows that almost one in four citizens considers that they have achieved their long-term objectives in the course of their efforts. Some half of the citizens consider that, during the course of their efforts, they have come closer to achieving their long-term goals. And everyone who works with vulnerable citizens with problems such as homelessness, abuse, mental illness and massive social challenges knows that these are actually quite good results. That is why we are now running the project in a round more with much better documentation, with much better reporting, to find out exactly what kind of instruments are working; to find out exactly what kind of future dreams these citizens have had. We need to be very much smarter on the project to have the tools to hopefully ensure that the project becomes available in many more municipalities, much like for many more vulnerable citizens, but also like for many other Danes who need support to get back on their feet and support to solve the challenges of their lives that make them not part of the community right now. Thank you, President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315170119	Thank you to the rapporteur of the alternative. There are no brief comments. The next speaker is Mrs Karina Adsbøl, outside the groups. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315170132	Thank you. I could not help speaking because I myself have been involved in these negotiations and I am part of the agreement that we had negotiated, where we have just been given funding for an application pool that municipalities can apply for. We did so in the past, as the rapporteur for the Alternative also said, in the so-called 'rate pool', where we sat around the table and heard about the proposal on citizen-led budgets. And that's right, sir. Torsten Gejl says that there were probably some rapporteurs who had to think about it and just had to chew on it that way with citizen-led budgets. But it's really good when you meet and you can agree on things. The scheme has been in force between 2017 and 2020, and the aim is precisely to support the target group's path to a greater degree of self-determination, rehabilitation and better quality of life. The citizen gets a draw right of DKK 50,000, which he can use at his own request for various activities and other minor expenses for a continuous period of 15 months. And it is then up to the individual citizen, in cooperation with a social worker, to define what wishes and objectives he or she has in relation to the course he or she is going through. And it is precisely with a view to putting the life of the citizen at the centre. It is really, really good when we adopt something that is good. The challenge is, of course, sometimes that we make experimental arrangements over and over again, and we have done so, I can mention, innumerable places in relation to blind and partially sighted people in connection with escorts. You just want things to be implemented by law. I was also interested in reading about the experience with the trial system from Halsnæs, and here was among other things. a quote from a user, and the quote was: If I had not been part of the project, I would probably have continued in a wild abuse and had ended up killing myself. And today the young woman has stopped her abuse, is almost finished her education, has become a mother and lives in a stable relationship, and she no longer gets support. That's very life-affirming. Experience from Halsnæs also shows that almost all project participants at the end of the project have significantly reduced or stopped their alcohol and drugs abuse. They have improved mentally, and some of the participants have come closer to the labour market and some have also entered jobs. And there are also several of these project participants who have used the funds to be at the dentist, so that they could sort out their teeth so that they could, like, strengthen their self-confidence, also in relation to having to look for jobs and other things. So I just want to say that I support the proposal. It's a good fight, sir. Torsten Gejl. One should also be able to praise one another when one has been in a negotiating process, and I think it has been well done. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315170435	Thank you to Mrs Karina Adsbøl. The next to speak is the Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for the Elderly. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315170447	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to the rapporteurs. I will hurry to stand up and say that I too was extremely happy when I saw Mr. Torsten Gejl here in the hall, because we needed you at the beginning, so it was so good that you made it. Otherwise, I would have sent you a collective greeting, too. Fourth Vice-President Not directly indictment!). Sorry, I wanted to call for us to send the rapporteur but now the rapporteur is sitting down there in the second row smiling, freshly cut and all, I think, and has been able to hear the discussion here as well. I would just like to acknowledge receipt, and it is, of course, a broad agreement that we have made, so it is of course not quite shocking to me that there is such warm support for the proposal here. I do not want to go into that much detail, but it is on the basis of our agreement in the autumn on the reserve, and with the proposal we will then have the necessary legal basis for the municipalities that end up being experimental municipalities to gain experience with the personal budgets combined with social support and all the good we achieve by it, in terms of increasing the citizen's ability to achieve his own goals in life, greater self-determination, rehabilitation, quality of life. I think my good colleagues have explained this quite well, and the same goes for the fact that there has been good experience when we had last allocated funds for this experiment. However, what we could also see from the experience, although they were generally positive, that is to say the experience of improving the quality of life for these citizens, a change in the division of roles in cooperation with the municipalities, in fact the things we had provided and wanted, also showed that it could be difficult to achieve it within the time frame to which we had given legal advice, and therefore we are now putting forward a new attempt, which we are following closely, which has been mentioned by several people, and we have also allocated funds to the Social Protection Agency, and we are also extending the period during which the experiment can take place. I am glad that the draft law now provides us with the legal basis for another round of experiments, where the process is slightly extended, so that the citizen will have a little more time to spend his budget, and hopefully we can see an even greater degree of implementation of the positive effects of these citizen-led budgets and the way to work with this target group of citizens. And then I know and if I had been in doubt, I have been confirmed in this after the debate that we are going to have some really good discussions following the next round attempt, where we will also get a knowledge that goes somewhat closer. So I'll look forward to it too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315170724	Thank you very much to the Minister for Social Affairs and the elderly. There are no brief comments. Since no one else has asked to speak either, the debate has ended. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Social Affairs and the Elderly, and if no one objects, I consider this to be adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315170741	The debate is open. First, we give the floor to the Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for the Elderly. Welcome back.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315170802	Yeah, thanks for that. Then we can skip the cleaning sometimes when it's the same speaker standing up here. The proposal here proposes two measures to deal with parents who provide incorrect information about the other parent in a parental responsibility case. Firstly, according to the proposal, it must have criminal consequences for a parent who is engaging in cooperation harassment in matters of parental responsibility in the Family Court House. Secondly, if a parent has made false claims about the other parent, the harassment must cause procedural damage. The proposers write: "There is something wrong with the system, if it can put a parent better in a custody case, that he makes false claims against the other parent, because this may lead to the other parent losing a custody or association case. ▪ I just have to say at the outset that it is not the Family Court House or family law that creates the very conflicting and deeply, deeply unhappy matters; it is the parents themselves. I find it very difficult to see what incentive the system should have to reward parents who are harassing. That is why, in my view, it is also a completely wrong premise to put down a system whose primary purpose is to take care of the child by offering conflict management so that parents can find a solution on their own every time it is possible and by making a clear decision when it is necessary. The system must, of course, deal with harassment, and the system does so today, among other things. by being able to deprive a harassing parent of custody. When you read the proposal, it looks simple and straightforward: the parent who speaks untruely about the other parent must be punished for it. A picture is drawn that it is relatively straightforward to determine what is at stake when there are doubts between two parents about a claim. But reality is not that simple, and there are various reasons for this. Firstly, consideration of the child's best interests and the child's right to well-being and protection comes first in matters of parental responsibility. It has a unanimous Parliament chiseled in stone with the reform of family law. Indicates a parent about risk factors, e.g. I understand that the authors of the motion are in complete agreement with this, and I am pleased about that. At the same time, it is just as if the complexity of these cases is not recognised. It is thought that it is straightforward for the House of the Family to determine when the allegations are true and when they are not. But that is not the case. Cases in which information is given on e.g. violence, abuse or mental illness are complex, and they range very far. In some cases it will be relatively obvious that the child must be shielded from a parent convicted of murder or abuse. Conversely, there are also cases where it is quite obvious that there is nothing about the claim. Perhaps it has been put forward several times, perhaps it has been documented that this is not true, by thorough investigation in the past. If that is the case, then it does not matter when the case is to be decided. Then it will not be taken as a basis. That there may then be other reasons why there should not be association in those matters is, of course, another matter and another discussion. Between these two extremes, that is, where it's obvious that the child has to be shielded because a parent, for example. If you have been convicted of murder, and the cases where you can see that the accusation has already been uncovered and found undocumented in the past, there are all those cases where it is difficult to see through what is at stake and where, for example, the conflict between parents. is so violent and has been so long that the child reacts in a way that one of the parents is actually concerned about whether the child is exposed to something that harms it. There I just have to say that we cannot punish being worried, even if it turns out that fortunately there was nothing to worry about. Even if there are cases where it is not a matter of concern, but a parent who says something about the other parent only to harass, it would not be easy to label such a statement as a criminal offence if we go into the legal discussion. In order to be able to be punished, one must have the necessary intention, which means that the parent deliberately makes a claim which the parent knows is untrue. This is often not clear in parental responsibility cases, as case law also confirms, i.e. that statements made by parents in a parental responsibility case cannot be considered in isolation, but must be seen from a wider perspective. The proposers agree that cases where risk factors are claimed should be investigated for the child's sake, and thank you for that. This is precisely how the new system is put together: the complex cases are settled by the Family Court House and are settled in family law, where parents are already acting under criminal responsibility. At the time of the investigation, the Family Court House does not base uncritical information from one parent. In accordance with the principles of administrative law, it is necessary to ensure that the case is fully disclosed so that a decision can be taken on an adequate basis. Information can therefore be obtained from other authorities, for example: the police, the health authorities and the municipality, to determine whether the information can be substantiated; It is also important to emphasise that parents have a number of guarantees of legal certainty. The family courthouse is among other things. an obligation to consult the parents on information which is provided in the case and which may have an impact on the decision of the case. This allows parents to draw attention to and correct any incorrect information in connection with the proceedings of the Family Court. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, parents in family law speak under criminal responsibility and, as the authors themselves point out, it is also possible today to have an libel case if one feels that one's honour has been violated. There are, however, very sparing case-law for libel cases in this area, and it is probably true that parents have the power to go that way. However, I must also say that I find it difficult to see that criminal proceedings will make it much easier to hold parents to account for their statements than is the case with an injuresag. When you read the proposal and follow the debate on harassment, you will see that the system and we politicians are passive, while many parents get away with harassing the other parent completely out of the child's life. As I have also explained in previous replies to the committee, that is not the reality. Relatively speaking, few parents do not see their children because of conflict with the other parent, and the system is already tackling harassment. It happens, among other things. in that the Family Court House with the 2015 harassment package has been given a number of tools to counter harassment. Among other things: there is an obligation to meet, and contact with the child can be ensured with contact-preservation and custody can be lost by serious cooperation harassment. That is clearly the case, and I think we have indeed sent it to the committee, and we are happy to do so again during the committee procedure. The legislation in force is therefore already in place to deal with harassment, which may have consequences for the harassing parent and thus damage the parent's case, as the proposal calls for. It is not quite clear how, in addition to criminal liability, it is intended to further harm the cause of the harassing parent to provide incorrect information and how incorrect information is to be attributed to procedural damage. One important point in this context is that we cannot automatically give custody to a parent just because the other parent has said something that is not true. The decision must always be made on the basis of what is best for the child. This is a fundamental principle and we must not abandon it. When it comes to imposing further criminal sanctions, I believe that the proposal misses the dial. It cannot be the task of the family law system to decide whether a statement of a criminal offence or to use resources to assist in the possible handling of criminal proceedings. In my opinion, there are far more important tasks to be done in the family law system, and there are already various sanctions, as I have described in my answer or speech here today. The most important thing in the most conflicting cases, which are, after all, some of the most unhappy cases that exist where children get caught up, is torn apart and it draws for them long traces through their childhood and, indeed, often also into adult life • in my view, will always have to be the child's best. In view of this, the government cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315171705	Thank you, Minister. There is a brief comment from Mrs Karina Adsbøl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315171710	Thank you. I would like to ask the Minister how it can be for the best of the child if one parent makes false claims about the other parent. If one parent exercises parenthood in relation to the other parent, how is it for the child's good that the parent is given custody? It is in relation to these conflicts that, unfortunately, often arise in divorce. It may be that the other party has been unfaithful, and then you use the children in a divorce. So I find it a little difficult to understand that the Minister does not want to find any solutions to this. We have adopted a paragraph on psychological violence. I think it must also be psychological violence to be prevented from seeing your children if one parent talks untruely about the other parent. This is precisely a proposal to accommodate the fact that we are getting some action in this area. We have had consultations, we have had consultations, and these are serious situations for the families it affects.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315171820	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315171822	Thank you. I think that in my speech here I have explained, also relatively thoroughly, that it has and may have major consequences today to engage in social and cooperation harassment, including false claims about the other parent. In the end, you may lose custody. We have the practice of judging that. We have also turned that around in a number of consultations. So it's not like I'm standing here saying it shouldn't have any consequences. It already has consequences today. That's what it's supposed to have. We simply cannot do an automatism that states that because one parent says something that is wrong, the other must automatically have the right of access, or that anyone who says something wrong should not have the right to association, or what else it is for a procedural damage, as the proposers think there should be. That is not clear. We need to look at what the overall picture about the child is. We also need to act on it if there is any concern about the child, for example. are subjected to violence. In this way we cannot punish anxiety, but of course it needs to be unveiled, and if there is nothing about concern, then it should not be taken into account anywhere.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315171930	Thank you. Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315171932	The proposal states that the penalty for making false claims about the other parent must be noticeable, and this can be done, for example. be a fine of not insignificant size. I mean, you shouldn't even be able to tell falsehoods about the other. We should not be free to exercise parental alienation, and we are unfortunately seeing examples of this. I just want to say, does the Minister recognize that there is a parenthood? Does the Minister recognize that this could be a problem in a divorce? The Parental Responsibility Act does not say anything about parenting, and when it was negotiated here, parenting and cooperation harassment were not mentioned.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172013	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172014	Thank you. After all, a package was made I believe it was in 2015; I myself was neither a minister nor a rapporteur in this area who introduced some of the things that I went through in my speech and which precisely stem the possibility of sabotaging decisions on association and other matters, for example. by the introduction of the obligation to attend. We can see that it is already the case that there is a case-law in which it can have the consequence of losing custody if you exercise the right of association. So the things that are being called for are in the system today. And no, there's nothing good to say about divorce parents who can't work together for their children. There's nothing good to say about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172055	Thank you to the Minister for Social Affairs and the elderly. There are no more brief comments and the first rapporteur is Mrs Camilla Fabricius. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172108	I would like to start by saying that I actually think that the Minister went through very, very thoroughly why the government does not support the resolution. That is why I would like to start by saying that neither does social democracy. And then I would like to use some of my speaking time to talk about the basic premise and the discussion going on in society and some of the many approaches we have received as social and family rapporteurs. Because in relation to this part of the relationship, I just think it's really important to say to the incredibly many people who are connected to the family justice system that at some point in their lives have had to get divorced and find out who it is that should have custody of the vast majority of parents are actually doing it quite properly and sensibly. Sometimes they have had to get some help, and in some particular cases, as the Minister also describes, things are not going very well. The basic thing that we've been working on all along in this parliamentary period compared to what we got handed down from the Family Court House has been that we've had to invest more money than usual. When you look at the starting point of the Family Court House, I just want to congratulate those who have helped make that decision because you have so much put the child first. I think that is really central when you take this discussion about a word that sounds very serious: the association chaikane is this: we are looking at what it is that the child has and what it is that needs to be present for you to take the angles of entry that are there. I have just received so many requests from mothers who are genuinely concerned that they should lose contact with their children; mothers who have experienced mental violence and physical violence and who have been under pressure. And I think that the overall discussion, which I also find this resolution aimed at, is the question of what we are doing there, where parents clearly do not agree and their perspective is very different, and they actually want the other to fail. In other words, where parents actually sit and look at their children and look at each other in the hope that it will fail, and therefore resort to things that they might not have done if they had been able to. Well, if you rewinded your life ten years forward and looked back at what you put up with each other and stood up to the kids, then I think you'd think: if I could have acted differently, I would have done it. That is why it is quite fundamental and fundamental in the motion for a resolution precisely how we are going to have the conversation; how we as a society work in the relations we have between ourselves, but also in the systems we have, to have things taken into account and to take account of those that are at stake and, in this case, clearly the children. I mean, we have a family courthouse that has such a framework. I also fully agree with the Minister that if something criminal has happened, it must be lifted over somewhere else. The way in which we have arranged the system, namely that you have conversations, if it is particularly challenging, I think is the way forward for children, and therefore also for parents and for families. So I think you really have to turn it around. So to all of you out there, I would like to say that it is important to know that the Family Court House is a really nice and good place, and that when you are awful, awful disagree, you also find it difficult to meet the system. So if we are to create a trusting system that takes into account, then we also need to work with the overall trust that exists for those people, and we need to be better at having a professionalism about being able to ask questions about the difficult issues. That is also one of the things we have been working on all along and that we have been focusing on when we have evaluated. It is about getting the professionalism to be present, and there is the Family Court House in a far better place today than it was three years ago.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172608	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a brief comment from Mrs Karina Adsbøl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172612	Thank you. I would also have been surprised if the Socialist rapporteur had stood in the Chair and said that she supported the proposal. But I would like to know whether the Socialist rapporteur does not recognise that there are challenges; that there are parents who experience unfair treatment; that there are parents who experience that it can benefit if you say falsehoods, if you make parent alienation; that there are those challenges and that it certainly has not made it better that there has been such a long time of proceedings, even when there are conflicts. And when there is a long process time, it also increases the level of conflict, because it takes longer to get into conversation. Does the rapporteur recognise that there are some challenges in the House of Family Rights, because I really found that difficult to assess on the basis of the rapporteur's speech?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172708	Here you go. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172709	Thank you. No, I actually think I tried to answer it quite clearly, namely that the Family Court House was born with an underfunding over which we have helped each other; that it was born with a really good view of children and people; that we have worked to get a professionalism into the Family Court House. It has been new people who have been employed in many places, and you have had to put your hat on differently. Some of the things we have been focusing on are, of course, among other things. to have a violent approach, that is to understand how both physical and psychological violence translates into the relationship between parents and what effect it can have on the child. So I actually think I recognised that there have been challenges. I also said that I think we are in a far better place than we were three years ago. So I simply do not agree with the basic premise in the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172802	Here you go. The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172804	So when we have a parental responsibility law that has not taken account of parenting and cooperation harassment into account, in the sense that it is not written into the law, the rapporteur does not think that we should change it, so that we should just as well focus on the fact that this is also what can happen when parents are in conflict; that this is what is happening. That is what I have in any case received a number of requests about happening. And suddenly it happens that time has passed and that as a parent you haven't seen your child for a long, long time, and then it's hard to get back on track. So what will the Socialist rapporteur do for those parents?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172844	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172847	I am quite sincerely pleased that the rapporteur is asking this question, because I really think that both myself and my party have so far been at the forefront of wanting to act on it and create a better everyday life for both children and families. So it's done with it? Did we snap our fingers and everything's okay? Is it the case that we wake up tomorrow, and then there are families where there is no argument and where there are no great challenges? No, I don't think so. I agree with the rapporteur that we continue to have a task that we need to solve.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172920	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to Mrs Camilla Fabricius. And then it is the rapporteur of the Left, Mrs Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315172928	Thank you for the floor. I would also like to thank Mrs Karina Adsbøl, who is behind this resolution we are debating today. This is, in fact, an important proposal in relation to the whole debate that has been going on for the past year around the House of Family Rights. It is also a debate that has taken me personally into account, which is why I am also pleased that Mrs Karina Adsbøl, with her resolution today, is once again focusing on the vile consequences of the harassment of cooperation and association from these parents in the system and, above all, from their children. There are few policy areas on which I, as a family rapporteur, have so many inquiries, and in particular these disputes in relation to social matters. If just a fraction of the inquiries I receive ended up in the media, perhaps there was also such basically a little more focus on it. And the truth is that there isn't enough focus on these horrible and disgusting disputes that are, mainly around social matters. And frankly, it is also a failure of children who risk losing contact with their grandparents, their half-sisters and, at worst, their mother or father forever. A cut-off from a mother or father does not just mean that the family is halved, it also means that the entire origin and identity of the child are halved. It cuts my heart that innocent children are squeezed and it is completely unreasonable between the parents' controversy and fictional stories, while the family is being divided. It cannot and must not stand on any longer. I have said that here from the platform several times before. That is why we in the Left welcome the intention behind the motion for a resolution, because we agree that we must have legislation that puts the child first. At the same time, however, we are uncertain whether this resolution is the right solution, and this is due to several things. First of all, we are concerned that legal verification of an allegation of association would lead to an even greater increase in the level of conflict in matters of parental responsibility and association. At the same time, we also run the risk of dragging out the processing time even further. And unfortunately, these are already very complex cases, and the decisions are unfortunately not always straightforward. It falls on top of the fact that the hump of the most extensive section 7 cases in the Family Court House is steadily growing, while the processing times are sky-high. That is why the proposal will undoubtedly mean that more families will have to wait even longer for a decision, which ultimately damages the child's attachment to the parents. Secondly, we in the Left are concerned about the child's best interests in matters. It's just that no matter what parent is alienated, the ultimate victim in these cases is the child. Finally, we believe that there is already a possibility of punishing in the field of cooperation harassment within the legislation in force in the criminal code. This has been demonstrated by a recent Supreme Court ruling as well as two U.S. courts. Common to the three judgments is that the joint custody was abolished when it was found by the court that the other parent had engaged in gross association with the Schikane and that the parents would thus also be unable to cooperate on the child in the longer term. Honestly, that is the sin of hammers for the child, who has been pinned down for years between parental quarrels and fictional stories, and who, as a consequence, loses association with and association with one parent. However, although it is a pity for the child, it is nevertheless positive that the repeated cases of contact with a parent are punished. Because, with the three judgments, we see that the legal system is taking action against serious associations when it is necessary. The courts have spoken, and that is why it should be used as a warning to the parents who are deliberately engaging in social affairs. That is why we must also be careful that we do not make double legislation by inserting a provision into the parental responsibility law when existing legislation already makes this possible here today. Finally, and now I think my speaking time is being spent, I would like to make it clear once and for all that the best interests of the child must always be the overriding concern in the House of Family Rights and in matters of association. Therefore, even when matters are muddy and difficult to see through, we should at least try to maintain close ties with both parents. For all things in the world, we must avoid several of the heartbreaking stories we have all heard about or know about cases where a mother or a father will hit the other parent and therefore invent stories about the other parent. In the end, it means one thing: that the contact between a parent and a child disappears. The Left therefore follows the challenges of the House of Families closely. I do not think there is any doubt about that any longer and we fully recognise and support the intention behind the motion for a resolution. But if this resolution necessarily has the right solutions to the problems, we are not fully clarified yet. In any case, we must be sure that we do not create double legislation, and we must also be careful not to create a lot of new legislation in an already pressured system. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173436	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173443	Thank you. Thank you, too, to the rapporteur of the Left for his speech. The Left is also very concerned about ensuring that action is taken in this area. Now I come up with this proposal to focus precisely on it, because parenting is something that we have at least received e-mails about also being something you experience on your own body. • One of the parties in a divorce experience that the other party can exercise it against the children and thus turn the children against you. That's one thing. The other thing is in relation to the sentences. There is nothing in the Parental Responsibility Act about these things that are about liberating statements, and defamation is also difficult to make a case about. It's also hard for the police to take such a case. So I would like to hear the rapporteur from the Left, whether the rapporteur from the Left does not think there is a need for us to look again at the law on parental responsibility in relation to having things written into the law, which must at least ensure that it is not worthwhile, that we are not telling the truth about the other parent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173553	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173556	The short answer is yes. Nor are we in the Left opposed to looking at whether something is being changed in the parental responsibility law. Actually, these cases show the Supreme Court case, and I think it was two court cases that have been tried to show the way. And, as I also said in my speech, I fully acknowledge Mrs Adsbøl's intention behind this. At the moment, we just think that with the challenges that are in the House of Family Rights, there is plenty to address. That was said in the first place by the rapporteur. I agree with the rapporteur that the House of Families has just these challenges, and that is why we do not think that we should, as such, look at making legislation on this when there is already an opportunity.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173634	Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173637	But perhaps the rapporteur of the Left can inform those who follow the debate about what the Left would like to do. How will the Left ensure that the Family Court House ensures that families and children receive the proper and dignified treatment they need? How do you ensure that this process is proper for all parties? How will the Left try to do that? What are the amendments proposed by the Left?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173711	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173713	Thank you for that question. So, in relation to what we really think better should be done here and now, I have just proposed that these so-called red cases, i.e. the 7 cases, be brought directly to court. That is why we supported the proposals of the New Citizens' Party 100 per cent. In fact, we believe that this is one of the places where we can just move on some parameters. We're also willing to see if there's anything else that needs to change in this. Well, it's a huge reform, and it's had a few years, and it's still not fully implemented, and it's somewhere hopeless that it goes back to 2019; I think the implementation has stopped at 65 percent. This also suggests that there are some challenges with this system that we should have looked at so much. Then I also think that the preventive work that is part of the reform is very, very important.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173801	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. And then it is SF's rapporteur, Mrs Ina Strejer-Schmidt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173809	We have sympathy for the intention of the proposal, but that is not the right way to go. It already has a procedural adverse effect today if a party tries to obstruct a case in the family law system. Furthermore, we believe that it would be conflict stairs if, alongside a case in the Family Court House, criminal proceedings were to be conducted in another system. In addition, if the Family Court House were also to be involved in criminal proceedings, the waiting period in the proceedings would probably increase again. Instead, there should be recourse to instruments that are already in place, such as: periodic penalty payments when agreements are broken, and then action must be taken in the past to support cooperation between parents. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173852	Thank you, and there is a brief comment. Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173854	Thanks for a quick speech. I should just like to hear the rapporteur for the SF: what are some of the things in the system that the SF would like to have changed? And does the SF's rapporteur recognise that parenting can take place, that there may be parental harassment, that there may be a parent who makes false claims about the other parent and puts the other parent in a worse light? Well, how will SF solve those challenges? I'd like to hear that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173929	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315173931	I fully recognise that there are cases where some are trying to obstruct the case on one side. However, in relation to increasing the penalty for fines, I do not think that is what deters parents. For them, the most important thing is the association with their children, and there is already a fine or a penalty when you try to obstruct the matter; it shows, for example, that the situation is not the same. the cases that have been in the Supreme Court. So I'm thinking that punishment is the biggest punishment, the fact that you get less association with your child when you try to obstruct the case. And what could then be a solution is that you try to invest more resources in getting better cooperation between parents in the past, so that the conflicts do not get out of hand.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174029	Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174031	So, as I heard the Minister in the Minister's speech, the Minister said that it might well be that some people spoke falsely and other things, but that whoever obstructed this could also easily end up with custody, that is, the one who made falsehoods. And that's what we're anchoring a little bit about, in that it mustn't pay to obstruct this and talk untruely about the other to put himself in a better light, including in relation to parent alienation. Does the rapporteur not also recognise that this is the challenge and that action is needed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174110	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174112	Yes, I fully acknowledge it. I just don't think that what is being proposed in the proposal says that you want to increase the penalty... is what keeps the parents from obstructing a case, because it is much more important for them to have this relationship with the children than that they risk being fined. And, as I said, the courts are already punishing it if you try to obstruct a case in relation to association with the child.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174141	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the SF rapporteur. Then it is the Radical Left rapporteur, Mrs Christina Thorholm. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174149	The child's attachment, best interests and development opportunities are the most important to take care of when parents are divorced. We know that children are incredibly caught between two parents who find it difficult to work together on decisions on association and residence and that the child's development potential may be damaged when his immediate carers obstruct or are unable to cooperate in the proceedings. Therefore, it is also important that we look at the family law practice and opportunities to improve efforts, not least in cases where parents find it difficult to cooperate. There's the Family Court House they're looking for help with. The family courthouse is established to create a better framework for supporting parents and children in the process. We know that there are too many cases of harassment and groundless postulates, and we need to deal with these cases better in order to create the best framework for association and the child's attachment and well-being, also later in life. The cases must be thoroughly investigated, as there is no criminal liability in the Family Court House. The family courthouse has had too long waiting times at the start, and it is working on relations between the parents and the child. We have contributed more money to the Family Court House in order to reduce the difficult waiting time and not to take families into too long and grueling a process which accelerates the inappropriate behaviour of parents or, at least, can reduce parental ability. Divorce is about sharing the most loved one for the parents, and for some it becomes a battle that has no limits, against the former spouse in relation to obtaining the right to the child. The Radical Left believes that the answer lies in the professional assessments of parents' parental capacity and thorough examination of the statements made by parents. The family courthouse has several tools to investigate the context of the case: children's studies, examination of parental competences, temporary association decisions, contact-preservation, supervised association and enforcement. The consultation on the family justice system shows that several of these tools are not being used sufficiently. We stress the recommendations of the Children's Terms and of several lawyers at the hearing in relation to the prevention of harassment and incorrect information. The recommendations are about increased frequency and quality in child studies; the obligation to follow up on how children work with the solutions decided on; the establishment of supervised association and instructions when deciding on a change in the child's place of residence; the risk to the parent if he or she opposes association; the obligation to examine the parental competences and parental capacity of both parents; the rules of method and use of authorized psychologists. The Radical Left believes that it should not be made a criminal offence to engage in cooperation harassment when untruths are presented, as the complexity of these cases is far more easily resolved in processes and through professional investigations and follow-up of efforts. It is about getting parents to cooperate, about the child's attachment to parents, well-being and development opportunities. We will press for more commitment to uncovering the matter and using the tools of the Family Court House and using sanctions, because there are too many unfortunate cases and cases of high conflict.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174546	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174549	Thank you. I find it a little difficult to find out what the Radicals are actually going to do in relation to the House of Family Rights and in relation to the challenges there are. As I hear the radical rapporteur, the radical rapporteur says that, for the Radicals, it is fine to make falsehoods and allegations, that nothing will be done about that, and the rapporteur must correct me if I misunderstood it. Because it is the case today that parenting, libel and statements are not included in the parental responsibility law. And we have then written an example in relation to the fact that there must be consequences if you are not telling the truth, and that can be done, for example. be subject to increased fines. Those were the things we had to find out if there was a majority in favour of this: what are we doing in relation to the consequences that we have to put into practice, what is the paragraph we want into the parental responsibility law, and what are the consequences? Anyway, what are the radicals going to do? Because we have not made any progress from the hearing in relation to the proposals made by those who presented the hearing, or consultations, and what else we have had about the challenges that are in the House of Families.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174706	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174709	As I concluded by outlining because I had listed a number of options that we wanted to emphasise, it is the duty: the duty to carry out parental capacity studies and the duty to carry out child-care examinations and follow-up. The obligation to do so is an option, but not a duty, and there I think we can tighten up the practice of the House of Family Rights, also by deciding on a change in the child's place of residence, which opposes association. So there are some clear recommendations that we can ask the Minister to incorporate into the evaluation that needs to be done. The evaluation takes a relatively long time before we get it, so that we get the pressure on to get some of these commitment efforts in place is important to us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174805	Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174807	What the Radicals can do to get the Minister to do is exciting. But I would really like to hear from the radical rapporteur whether the things mentioned by the radical rapporteur are something that the Radicals are going to propose in the Chamber, in other words with regard to the duty, or whether it is something that will wait a long time for something to happen with. Or how do we move on from here in relation to the challenges we see in the House of Family Rights, which we have been discussing in recent years?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174840	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174842	Now there must be some debate on this motion for a resolution, and there we have an opportunity to look at what we can agree on. And that is where we are going to bring the prospects we have into the negotiations on this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174858	Thank you. There are no more brief comments to the radical rapporteur. Then we have reached the Enhedslisten's rapporteur. Here you go, Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315174913	I have been the social rapporteur for the Enhedslisten for quite a few years now, and one of the worst things about it is the issues of divorces that end in a stalemate. These are the e-mails in the inbox from often a mother who says that the child is beaten by the father; I dare not extradite for association. It's e-mails from the fathers saying I'm being accused of violence. I've never done it. I can't see my baby. And you don't have an earthly chance as a politician and outsiders to decide what is right and wrong. All you know is that this situation is damaging to children. Whether the accusations of violence are right or not being listened to, or whether the accusations of violence are something that is being said to prevent association, this is a completely terrible situation for children. The high conflicts that end up in that way, it hurts children to be in. I have also played a very large part in adjusting the legislation, namely the parental responsibility law to one side and to the other. And if I am to be quite honest, it is also the case that sometimes the mood goes a little in one direction, and then there are too many cases where there are no accusations of violence, and sometimes the mood goes a little in the other direction. It is not to belittle any of it, but it is to say that I think we must be very careful to believe that, on the basis of the individual cases in which we hear one of two very conflicting sides, we are able to say something in general about a system. Of course, there is no need to make false information available to any public authority. Moreover, this can already be a criminal offence in itself. Of course it must also be the case that if you repeatedly prevent association or obstruct family law, it must have an effect on the matter. But the most important thing is that the decision is ultimately about the children. It's not about what the parents are entitled to. It is about making the decision that is ultimately right for children. Several people have mentioned this. One can easily imagine cases where an obstruction also means that what you do really harms children, and then it can lead to the eventual loss of custody. That's the way it's supposed to be. However, we must ensure that the people who are dealing with the individual cases have proper time for them, can escalate conflict and that they can ultimately make the decisions that are right for the children. I do not think that this resolution meets these criteria. This does not mean that I do not believe that we may forever and forever and probably also long after I have finished in the Folketing, will sit and adjust the parental responsibility law. I think we will. I'm not sure we've hit the right thing. I don't think we'll ever do that. And that's because these cases are basically so unhappy. There is just not really a good outcome to cases where parents have split up in a way that ends up with public authorities having to decide where their children should be. Therefore, the most important thing for us in the Enhedslisten is that we continue to invest in how we help families not only start a family life but also to end a family life in a good way. I think that the reform that we have made is terribly underfunded, unfortunately, and we have had to spend a lot of money on correcting it was good and that it was a good start. I think we should do more of that. The aim is then that in the long term we can also provide family advice long before it ends in cases where authority decisions are needed, but that people can be helped to get into the next phase of family life in a good and proper way. I think that is what we should be focusing on. The Enhedslisten cannot support this motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175343	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175345	Thank you. But I really think that was a very kind rejection of the resolution. But I'd like to hear something. Because, I think, we all agree that the child has the right to his mother and father. It is the child who has the right to his mother and father, the right to see his mother and father, and we all know that there may be some cases where it is best for the child not to see one or the other. We have also witnessed them in the press. But there are others where the level of conflict is so high, and that can be done, for example. Be because of adultery. It may be that one will then avenge himself on the other by doing such a thing that one should not see the children. At any rate, you will do everything in your power to prevent the other side from seeing the children as some kind of revenge action, and that's because you're hurt by your feelings and all these things. But I would like to hear from Mrs Pernille Skipper whether the word 'parental alienation' is something that the Enhedslisten wants to look at and whether we should get it into the parental responsibility law.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175455	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175458	It's not just such a random place in the parental responsibility law. I'd think that would be weird. I mean, I have no problem with the word parenting, but I do have a problem with such a storytelling that it should be something that permeates the system. It's not. I do not think it is. I do not believe that we have a system that takes sides with the parent who is a parent to the other parent. It's real. It happens, as happens, that there are warnings of violence being overheard. I mean, these are terrible, terrible things, and I cannot tell you from the outside or from a single e-mail or from a description in the press which of the two parties is right. All I can conclude is that it is quite awful that they fight so much because it hits the children. Well, I am not opposed to the word in itself, but I cannot stand by and say to Mrs Adsbøl that the word must enter into the law unless I know what sentence it is part of.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175557	Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175559	In any case, it is important to recognise that parenting is taking place in order to change something. That's one thing. The second point is that, in relation to the law on parental responsibility, we could well look at changing some things and also be clearer when it comes to the problem of cooperation, the problem of untruths and false claims, simply to be noticeable when it comes to not doing so. In other words, there must simply be consequences to it. Because I fully agree with Mrs Pernille Skipper that we cannot be a witness of truth. We know that our inbox is overflowing, and we know that whoever is on the other end has an experience of some things. So it is clear that we cannot do that, but when there are so many inquiries, I also believe that we, as politicians, have a duty to respond.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175649	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175650	I also believe that as politicians we have a duty to listen to the people who are addressing us. That is why I started by saying that during the many, many years I have been a social rapporteur, there have been many e-mails from people who are treated with their children, who are not allowed to have the association to which they are entitled, and there have also been e-mails from those who say: I am forced to hand over my child to a man whom I believe to be hit. I mean, we need surveys and data, etc. to legislate on the basis, and we cannot legislate on the basis of the inbox, no matter how much it affects us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175730	Thank you. There are no further brief comments to Mrs Pernille Skipper. So we move on to the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party, Mrs Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175742	Thank you very much. Thank you to the Danish People's Party for raising the motion for a resolution here, which gives rise to a discussion of custody cases and cases of association, where there is a conflict about parental authority and association, and where one parent tries to make false allegations about the other in order to advance his own cause. In the Conservative People's Party, we have always focused on the child's best interests, well-being and development. There is no doubt that it is incredibly hard and grueling for everyone involved when there is a high level of conflict in custody cases and cases of association, and at the same time false allegations are made about the other party in order to promote its own cause. We recognise the problem and therefore we are also positive about the purpose of the resolution here. We do, however, miss, among other things. to deepen the funding behind the proposal and how it should be understood when the motion for a resolution writes claims which, in their form, can approach librarian opinions and how the increased pressure on the courts that this proposal will bring about should be resolved. Finally, we also have other questions in relation to the motion for a resolution here, which we will then address in committee. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175915	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315175917	Well, I think that should be taken up in committee. Now it is the case that this proposal has been tabled and that a motion for a resolution has not been cut into granite. It is the case that if it is adopted, you will find out whether to negotiate or you will make a proposal for adoption that you want to look at it here. So it is not a legislative proposal that we have come up with; it is simply a way of getting attention to these challenges that are and we want to solve them. It is precisely in relation to this untruth and the fact that one claims something about the other parent, who is simply not true, but is liberating. We know that if there is to be an indictment, then you have to do it privately. I mean, it's not like that in the family courthouse. Therefore, it will be important to focus on the fact that this is actually happening. So I think that Conservatives should look at solutions rather than look at all the barriers that can be found in relation to a resolution and that we should sit together and find some good solutions to how we can solve the challenges of the House of Family Rights.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180026	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180029	We certainly do not see limitations. But it is clear that there are some things I mentioned here in my speech that we need to deepen. And we also have some further questions in relation to the resolution. It is clear that in order to be able to take a position, we need to have answers to some of these questions first and foremost.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180046	Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180050	It is clear, of course, that you are allowed to ask all the questions you would like to ask. But it is also just to say that when you make a motion for a resolution, it is not a legislative proposal. So, when you make a motion for a resolution, it is a declaration of intent, you might say, in relation to where you want to go. We want to go where the Family Court House is getting better and we can be sure that obstructing and untruths about the other parent are not worthwhile. And we must have tangible consequences for this, which is precisely why we want a separate paragraph in the parental responsibility law which makes it clear.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180126	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180128	Now it is not that long before we have to have a follow-up meeting, as far as I remember, about the Family Court House, and there it is also obvious to take it up in the rapporteur's circle; is that something we can look at, also in relation to the agreement we have made about the implementation of the Family Court House? I also think that there is now an implementation, and when it is fully implemented, there is what it will look like. So I think it is obvious to take this up in the rapporteur's group and, in addition, I would like to put some of the questions I have on the motion for a resolution here in committee.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180207	Thank you. There are no more brief comments to the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party. And then it is the rapporteur for the Danish People's Party. Mrs. Mette Hjermind Dencker, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180217	Thank you. What is so difficult in these matters of association is that we can never do anything right, because no matter how we legislate, when we deal with people, we have to legislate to a degree in which we of course ensure that every case worker is able to judge by his own intuition if he sees this parent make him uncomfortable. So we need to have plenty of rubber band in the legislation so that the people who work with people, with parents with children, can use their good judgment and their common sense. Therefore, it can be so frustrating when you get emails from both sides, because you never know what is up and down, and it may be, as Mrs Pernille Skipper said earlier, that all you know is that this is something that really hurts the children. Sometimes a parent's parenthood has to be stopped while a parent's parenthood is examined. During that time, children and parents are apart, and this may prove to be based on an untrue claim from another party. And these things are quite free and free today, and that is one of the things we need to do away with. But then the only question is what an untrue claim is. If the child comes home and tells her mother that he has been locked in the room this weekend, the mother naturally gets worried and passes on to the Family Court House that she is extremely insecure about sending her child to visit when she is told that the child is being locked in. Is that something that can be proved? No, it's not, because it's going on in the private home. Does that make an untrue claim? Not necessarily. Having said that, unfortunately, the association chaika is something of which there are so many examples. I know someone who is continuously exposed to it from his daughter's mother. He was going on vacation with his two daughters and saw that suddenly at the last moment the mother couldn't happen to find the care of the girl. It cost them a nice trip to Austria, and there were two girls who were really upset, and he had lost 15,000 kroner. On it. What were the consequences for the mother? None. She was complaining that his garden was an enormously insecure place to be. He hurried to fence it in. She made various claims about things he should have done to his daughter. After counsel from the lawyer, he replied by putting surveillance cameras with sound on every room in his house. Imagine living like that. Imagine living in such a way that you have to protect yourself just in order to disprove what is being said against you. Today you can freely accuse the other parent of everything. One can accuse the other parent of committing assault on a child and who will be the case worker who ignores such an accusation and says: I simply do not believe in this. Who wants it on their cape? Sometimes you have to react to it and then the matter is examined and the association is stopped, and you find that no, there was nothing in it. No, but what happens, what is the consequence of whoever has accused them of such falsehoods? That is what the proposal is proposing here. So we want to join the Danish People's Party in inserting a paragraph, but it is therefore important that we pretz it in a way that you can be felled when something is proven untrue, and preferably after you have received the first warning. So it is incredibly important that we take that into account. So I hope that with this proposal we will be able to help limit the presence of chicanes in favour of the child, so that the child can have a really good relationship with both parents. So in the Danish People's Party we can support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180702	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. And then it's Mrs. Mette Thiesen. Here you go, Mrs. Mette Thiesen from New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315180727	Thank you. In 2018, a broad agreement was made on a new family justice system, a system that was supposed to help more people in social matters, but which unfortunately does the opposite. The reason can be found in the Parental Responsibility Act and the Family Court House's practice. In this case, blame issues on a high level of conflict do not have any bearing on the issue of association, and that is quite crazy, and we in the New Citizens' Party have, of course, tabled a resolution to change that, but unfortunately it was voted down. So a parent living with the children can continue to deliberately cause a conflict and thereby win his children and cut off the other parent from association, and it is simply not worthy of a community of law. Unfortunately, that is not the only thing that is wrong in the family justice system. The procedure goes too slowly in the House of Families, and when the case is finally closed, it must nevertheless be passed on to the courts and settled there. In the meantime, years may have passed when one parent has not had the opportunity to associate with his child. It is a nightmare to imagine that slow procedures can actually result in you not having the association that you are entitled to with your child. A slow process holds parents and children in a conflict that is allowed to develop to the detriment of both children and parents. Against this background, I tabled a motion for a resolution to shift proceedings directly to the courts bypassing the House of Family Rights. This will shorten the process for the benefit of parents and children, because it is a state of nightmare to wait for matters to be settled when those who are now pulling out to up to one year. Unfortunately, however, that resolution was voted down a few weeks ago by a majority of the Folketing. But frankly, we simply cannot be aware of having a both dysfunctional and slow system in which one parent, typically the parent of residence, can cut off the other parent from having association with the child while the case goes on. In such cases, it is often the case that when family law is finally to deal with the case, the child has not had contact with the other parent for such a long time that the family court considers that the child is best placed to stay with the parent in order to maintain the status quo, even if the parent of residence has performed the relationship with him. In other words, with the present system of contact chicane, through the long and long course of action, we can put ourselves in a better position in the end. That is just not the way it should be. Legal certainty and justice are imperative, because it is about family life, and that is the most precious thing we have. It must not fail because of an inefficient and unfair system, and I and New Citizens are continuing to fight to ensure justice and legal certainty in the family justice system, and we have several resolutions on the way to ensuring this very thing. That is why, of course, we also support this proposal, which will put an end to the practice of unpunished lying in the House of Family Rights. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315181102	Thank you. There are no brief comments. Thank you to Mrs Mette Thiesen. Then we have reached the rapporteur for the proposers. Here you go, Mrs. Karina Adsbøl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315181129	Thank you. The Crown in Politiken on October 27, 2021 has the title "Family Houses Fail both children and parents'. The Crown deals with some of the problems experienced by parents in the Family Court House. When children's parents are separated, it is of great importance to the well-being of children that they can, as a starting point, maintain contact with both parents. Children have the right to their mother and to their father. We in the Committee on Social Affairs and the Elders have received several examples of parents' experiences with the Family Court House appealing to political action, and we have also held a hearing in committee on the challenges facing the Family Court House. I have tried with this proposal to accommodate something and require the government to ensure that it has criminal consequences for a parent who is engaging in a cooperation harassment in custody proceedings in the Family Court House, for example. by making untruths that put the other parent in a bad light, or by contributing to parenthood, so that the child is opposed to the other parent. It is then an attempt, for example, that one. can make a paragraph in the Parental Responsibility Act that makes it clear. In addition, the proposal is also about ensuring that in future it can cause procedural damage to a parent with a pending court case in the House of Family Rights, if he has tried to promote his own interests by making falsehoods and other things about the other party. This means in practice that it can harm a parent's cause if he or she has made false claims. Parental alienation, as I have already said, is something we are experiencing in these cases. It is clear that the authorities must never ignore serious accusations if there is a suspicion that a child has been subjected to abuse or violence. Then it is, of course, crucial that it should be examined. That is why we also set up children's houses to be used in cases of abuse against children or young people from 0 to 17 years of age if you have knowledge or suspicion that a child has been subjected to abuse. And when the police or hospital services are involved in the case, it is compulsory for a municipality to use the children's houses, which must be part of the children's study. Of course, we need to protect children. No one can disagree with that. But at the same time it is wrong to reward a parent who, in order to advance his own cause, makes false claims, assigns them full custody, or by cutting off the other parent from association. Then there is something wrong with the system, and in fact I think Mrs Mette Thiesen said it very clearly in her rapporteur's speech and thank you for the support. Because it is the case that it must never pay to make false statements about the other. A note from the Ministry, distributed in the Social and Older People's Committee, also states that the issue of sexual harassment and parenthood was not separately discussed or brought up during the negotiations back in 2018, and I think that is a mistake. I believe that we are obliged to do something about it and act on it. The highly conflicting divorces cause parents to fight each other so hard that the child who binds the family is torn apart. And when Mom and Dad break up and cannot agree on the children, many parents also experience sidetracking. I also think there should be a historical study of how many children over the years have completely lost their contact with one parent or another in divorce. I hope that the Minister will be in charge of carrying out such a study. I believe that we have a political responsibility to act, and this proposal, which has not been cut into granite, is an attempt to improve the system, as I do not think it is good enough as it is today. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315181617	Thank you to Mrs Karina Adsbøl. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Social Affairs and the Committee on the Elderly. Are there any comments? It's agreed. Now the next item is a question debate, and we shall have the rapporteurs logged in to the front seats up here. This means that you have to log off in your usual place.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315181817	I would point out that the vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until Tuesday 22 March 2022. The first to speak is Mrs Pernille Skipper, who is the rapporteur for the questioners, and Mrs Pernille Skipper must justify the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315181849	Thank you very much for the floor, and thank you to the rapporteurs for taking part in this debate. It is not a proposal for adoption or a motion for a resolution, but it is a desire to start a debate on some families that are becoming more and more in our society and that are being caught up in the system. Rainbow families call them, you can also call them lgbt+ families. There are more and more children growing up in families where they have more than two parents. It may be a lesbian couple and a good friend, it may be a gay couple and a good friend there may also be several people who decide to make a family that does not just fall into the classic core family with one father and one mother and some children. Family concepts have been evolving for many years. Now, in the Enhedslisten, we think it is time that we started talking about how we could extend the legislation to include the families of whom there are more and where the children have more than two parents. When I talk to the families I meet, they say that they are being met with scepticism and much else, but also a system that cannot contain them. There's only two boxes to cross off. There are only two who can take the child to the doctor; only two who can travel with the child; only two who can log in to Aula. There are all these facets in life, which are both extremely difficult, but which also remind both children and parents that society has not quite settled with them yet, to put it mildly. It is time for us to discuss how we also make legislation and a system that contains those families. For they exist; they are children who grow up loving and spacious places, but who thus bumps their foreheads against systems and structures that cannot accommodate them. They should. Therefore, we in the Enhedslisten have raised a query debate to take the talk about what we can do for those families. We have asked the Minister whether the Minister will explain his position in principle on the possibility of giving children the right to more legal parents than two, so that children will have the right to associate with all their parents, and the possibility that parents' rights in relation to maternity, children's sick days, school-home conversations, etc. will be improved. It must also be said that we have put a written question to the Minister to explain where there are problems in the system that children with more than two parents encounter. It takes some time, justifiably, to collect something like this, but fortunately the Minister has said that she will do so, so we are pleased about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315182142	Thank you for the explanatory statement to Mrs Pernille Skipper. Then it is the Minister of Social Affairs for an answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315182152	Thank you very much for that, President, and thank you to the rapporteur for the questioners for raising the debate here. I would like to begin by saying that, of course, I and the government recognise that there are more ways to be family than the one we have historically talked about as the core family, i.e. mother, father and two or three children. I do not know how many children there are in a classic core family, but that is to say, mother, father and a certain number of children constitute a classic core family. It must also reflect, just as when it makes sense for the child, emphasis must be placed on social parenthood and the relationship between the child and a social parent. There are those who believe that the legislation has not followed the times at all, but I believe that this is now a bit of a break-up, so let me start with some examples from my own area of legislation that supports different family forms. It is now a number of years since it became possible for two women to become parents together, by one woman becoming the child's co-mother, and under the parental responsibility law, custody of a child can be transferred by contract to someone other than the child's parents. In practice, it could be for one of the child's parent and his mate or partner, that is, the child's social parent. Another example is given in the area of the Minister for Employment. If the child is seriously ill for a long time, parents are able to stay at home and receive benefits while caring for their sick child under the maternity law. This possibility may also include social parents. In addition to pointing out existing rights, I would also like to say that the government naturally focuses on the fact that further changes may be needed on an ongoing basis in order to meet the needs of families. An important focus for us, however, is always that parents' needs should never overshadow consideration for the child. On 10 February this year, a broad majority in the Folketing, and thank you for that, adopted a bill which, among other things, to strengthen the family formation of lgbt+ persons by making the registration of co-motherhood more flexible. It is a proposal which responds to the needs of the parents to a large extent, while at the same time ensuring that the child is taken into account. Something is happening in other areas too. The authors of the question even mention the area of maternity as an area in which social parents should be better placed. The government is fully in favour of this, because here too we want more up-to-date legislation that can provide a greater degree of flexibility for lgbt+ families. That is why the government has, among other things: together with the contributors of the party of the query agreement that from 1 January 2024, HFT+ families will have the possibility that the two legal parents will be able to transfer some of their leave weeks and benefit rights to social parents. This will enable the family to decide much more for themselves what is best for them and their child. However, when it comes to the more specific issue here of legislating that the child should have more than two legal parents, I am more concerned. Listening to those who advocate such a scheme focuses mostly on situations in which adults agree and believe that they can easily lift a shared parenthood.So they can surely also follow the child's schooling together, share the economy with the child, make important decisions on behalf of the child; that's fine for them, and that's fine for the child. But I must also point out that, unfortunately, not all parents continue to agree on their children. We also have to deal with the fact that there are parents who disagree, and it may be anything from minor disagreements on everyday issues to major disagreements and very violent conflicts, when they break apart ■ by the way, in relation to the resolution we have just discussed, about the very difficult and very conflicting and very, very violent divorces for children. It can be challenging enough to agree on such matters when you are two. I know this as being responsible for parental responsibility and from the stories that I hear, and which we are also discussing together, about conflicts between parents and very pinched and exposed children. That is why I can be concerned about extending the circle of adults who have to agree because it increases the risk of conflict and therefore also the potential strain on the child. Or, to put it another way, the more adults who have the right to decide with regard to the child, the harder it will be to safeguard the interests of the child in cases where we cannot legislate against arises, namely when there is disagreement, conflict and divorce, and when all the good intentions are no longer possible. It may well be that some families talk in advance about what should happen when you break up. I just have to say that one thing is what you can agree on when everything looks like a new family, something else is the reality that meets you when things fall apart and you break with each other. Children's Conditions, which know the divorce field well, have also expressed concern about the proposal here. Lay me a thoughtful but not unthinkable example, as I think very well illustrates the difficult situation that a child can come if it has more than two legal parents. Ida, we call the girl here... it's a fictional name... and Ida has two legal mothers. Her biological mother is married to another woman who is Ida's mother. Ida's mothers break up and can't figure out how to distribute their association. Since they cannot find a solution on their own, they go to the Family Court House. Unfortunately, the conflict mediation cannot help them to reach agreement, although that is what we always hope for, so the House of Families decides that Ida must live in a divisive arrangement. Although a solution has been found, the parents are still not at their best, and it is difficult for Ida when the adults do not talk. Now imagine that Ida has two legal mothers who live together and two legal fathers who also live together. Ida is half the time with each couple of parents, but one day both couples split up, and there is disagreement about the distribution of intercourse within both couples. That is why they must take a trip to the House of Families, which, due to the failure of conflict mediation and continued disagreement, must take a decision. But what exactly is the decision to be made? Should Ida be one week at a time with each of the four parents? Is it in Ida's best interest to commute between four different homes with four parents who can't talk at all? And what about all the practical things, for example. when Ida has to start school and the four parents cannot agree on which school she should go to or whether she should go to football or dance? Thus, the challenge of having more than two legal parents will not only be expressed when parents break up and disagree on association, but will also cause problems in relation to disagreements on everyday matters. And when important decisions are to be made which require agreement • some of the major choices in life; whether the child should be confirmed, which school he should attend, or whether one or the other medical treatment is best for the child; then in these situations there are more than two legal parents, and then it may take longer to make a decision. And the more people who disagree, the more it can affect the child. So when we discuss the possibility of more than two legal parents, we must bear in mind that the concerns that need to be addressed can be very contradictory. In this respect, I have no doubt that consideration of the child's best must always be the bearer. To sum up, I am concerned about whether it is for the best of the child to open up the possibility for more than two legal parents. The risk of increasing the potential for conflict, both in everyday life and also in connection with consensual breakups, is a high price to pay for those children who may get into trouble. The focus on the rights of adults in my optics must never overshadow the focus on the child. I believe that there is a real risk of this, and that is why I believe that what has been the principle in force up to now, namely the principle of two legal parents, should be maintained. But with that said, the government will, of course, continue to work to support the family's ability to adapt in different ways, as I also spent some time describing in the introduction. And with that, thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183002	Thank you. One brief comment from the rapporteurs is now available, and first it is Mrs Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183009	Thank you very much, Minister, for your reply. I very much agree that consideration of the child's best must always be the bearer. I also think it is an excellent story that the Minister is poeting here, and I am not at all opposed to the fact that the problems that the Minister also talks about can arise. But I also have to ask whether, in Ida's example, it is the best thing for the child if Ida is told that her two fathers must never see again; if Ida is told that she is not entitled to her two fathers, because that conflict has now arisen and then there is no possibility that she has them in her life, that is because it will not motherhood, because the conflict has gone all the way up to a point. Well, this isn't about the parents' right to the kids. It is about the fact that if you do not recognise all parents as legal parents, then it can also affect the child to a very negative degree. Doesn't the Minister agree with that? And doesn't the Minister see that problem as well?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183118	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183120	Well, I think this is a field where there are quite a lot of dilemmas, and in fact there is this in common with the discussion we had just now, about a motion for a resolution on harassment and so on. in relation to the worst divorce cases, that it would be the very best thing in the world if we could legislate in here that adult people who choose to bring children together should simply be able to work together. We cannot legislate for them to stay together, but imagine if we could ensure that there were no conflicts where the children were caught. Unfortunately, we cannot legislate out of this, and that is why we have to strike a balance in the various dilemmas that exist and will be that we land in a place where we protect the child in the best possible way. I can easily hear that some of the dilemmas raised by Mrs Pernille Skipper here are relevant, and it makes the discussion difficult that things are not black and white. But in the end, I think we have the right principle when we say that there are two legal parents. Then there can be social parents, and then you can also ensure social parents in many different ways.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183227	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183230	Thank you. I would like to follow up the previous question from Pernille Skipper, because I agree entirely with the Minister that we need to safeguard the interests of the child and the child's best interests, but I do not think that the Minister is responding entirely to what to do in situations today where the child's best is to be allowed to live with one of the social parents. In other words, if you are four about a child today and there is a high conflict, then social parents have no option in the Family Court House, and the child will suffer if the child thrives best with the parents. This is a dilemma, and I would say that it was for the best of the child to have the right to all his parents. So what do you do in those cases? What is being done, because these children exist today, these families exist today, in other words, where there can be a high level of conflict today. So this isn't about the identification of that family form, because that family form exists today, but what do you do if the child thrives best with social parents?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183344	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183345	Thank you. In other words, the legislation already offers opportunities for social parents, as I think I described in my opening speech, for example. by the fact that a social parent, along with the child's one parent, may have custody of the child. I simply cannot stand here from the platform and say anything that is incorrect as a minister; I look down at my lawyers and see the case before me in a situation where the possibility that the social parent has been given custody has been taken advantage of. So let me say that now it is not Ida's case, but another thought that the questioner mentions that I would like to try to clarify, but that there are, at least today, various safeguards of rights and opportunities for social parents. I think it is essential that we have it. And as I also went through in my speech, I can easily spot several places where it makes sense, but right here we have something very legal in principle, in relation to how many parents the individual child has.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183446	Thank you. There are no further brief comments to be made to the Minister. We shall now proceed to the debate and to the general rules for short remarks. The first to speak is the rapporteur for the questioners. Here you go, Mrs. Pernille Skipper from the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315183507	Thank you. I would like to thank the Minister for his reply, and I will be quick to note the importance of the fact that, despite the fact that I do not agree with the conclusion, we have a minister and a government that recognises that we are done with the old-fashioned family concepts and that these are real families, even when children have more than two parents. It's really, really important. In a post in Information, Peter Hummelgaard, then Minister for Gender Equality, recently wrote with Enhedslisten, but also SF and Radicals: •Family anno 2021• • It was then that • comes in many forms. The legislation must, of course, follow suit. I think that is a very good introduction to a speech which also dealt with how we could grant maternity rights to more than two parents. That is why we have also taken the first important steps to have legally and legally recognised families where there are not only two parents. I think it is important that we recognise that there are problems associated with which are not the fault of families but which are the fault of the system. We end up very quickly, when we have these conversations, in discussions about what is happening in absolute high-conflict cases. I find it a little difficult to understand why rainbow families have to answer more for what they would potentially do if they one day end up in a high conflict situation than a heterosexual couple should. Nobody ever asked me and my heterosexual husband if we have a plan for what we're going to do with our two children the day we break up. Everyone just thinks it's gonna end up happy, even though the statistics show that it probably doesn't. So I think that we make far higher demands in practice on those parents who are more than two when they have children. And I don't think that's fair. On the contrary, what I meet are families who have much more talk about how to do things together, how to talk, what to do, even when you disagree about whether it is dancing or football, or something else you may have disagreements about as parents. So there is a tendency for the families who are more than two to talk much more about that before starting a family. So I really do not think that the additional requirements are reasonable. On the other hand, the children who do exist and who have happy family life and love for all theirs, for example. Three parents and are loved by all three parents, a whole lot of barriers. Children cannot come to the doctor with one of their parents; one of their parents does not have access to Aula, parents' conversations or the Health Platform and cannot travel with the children; the children have not inherited from the third parents and cannot get the surname. And if it should end in a divorce, the child does not have the right to the third parent, and that is quite awful to think about. With the idea that conflicts can get worse if there are more than two parties and I hear that is the Minister's main argument, we are potentially depriving the children of the right to their one parent. The minister knows what it does to children. There you don't have to look into the research, although much of it has been done to see what it does to children if they lose their one parent in life. All the practical problems you face as a family are also extremely stressful, and they come on top of the big upheavals that are already starting a family. It is also something that can affect children in a negative way, and that is some of what many of the families I have met tell you about. They are happy and have thought about this for a very, very long time, but it affects both them and the children when they meet the barriers in life. I would like to conclude by saying now that I hope that this discussion is the first step towards the fact that we can actually agree that families exist in many different forms. There was a time when divorce families were not classified as real families. There was also a time when it was said that families with two women and children were not real families. Luckily, we're over it. We also get beyond the fact that there are some who do not think that rainbow families with more than two parents are real families, because they are, and we must have legislation that goes with it, as then Minister for Gender Equality, Mr. Peter Hummelgaard so rightly said.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184009	Thank you to Mrs Pernille Skipper. Pernille Skipper Hov, I have an adoption text, I also have to read aloud). Yes, there is also a text for adoption.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184026	I have a proposal for adoption which I would like to read out on behalf of the SF, Radicals and Enhedslisten: Proposals for adoption The Danish Parliament notes that the classic family forms with one father, one mother and their common children are no longer adequate for the reality in which more and more children are growing up. Love does not know gender, lgbt+ families form and thrive, and there are children who grow up with parents of the same sex and with more than two parents. This reality should be recognised, and the Folketing took the first step in this by allowing for the possibility of sharing maternity leave with up to four social parents. The Danish Parliament therefore believes that studies and knowledge gathering on the extent of rainbow families with children with more than two parents in Denmark, their relationship and the barriers they encounter should be initiated in order to adapt the legislation so that more family forms are recognised. • V 51).
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184115	Thank you. The proposal for adoption will be included in the further debate. There are no brief remarks to Mrs Pernille Skipper. And then the next rapporteur is Mrs Camilla Fabricius from the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184141	Thank you. First of all, thank you to Mrs Pernille Skipper and the Enhedslisten for raising a central and essential issue for a number of people in our country. Some grow up in different family types from the classic one. That sentence alone is against me, i.e. the thing about coming from a family where there's one father and one mother... what about my father? He is from 1944; his parents were divorced, and the father left with another woman, the housekeeper, and lived in Polish. And did he grow up in a family that isn't historically true? We can look back on the way we have formed family all the way back from the Vikings there it was the one who remained who had the property, whether it was the woman, the shield maid who went out and killed, or it was the Viking, the man who went out and killed. Well, what are we looking at? And I really think that the discussion we are having here today is a grip on a modern time when we need to talk about the roles we have. Having said that, I am leaning on the Minister's conclusions. And what a question debate is possible is to have these fundamental discussions, which is why I would like to ask the authors the other way, but perhaps I should have done that a moment ago. Yeah, I had to, so I just misunderstood something. But what I think might be interesting is this about whether it's just lgbt+ families. What if it is families that break up very early and then have other partners that the children experience as having an important role in their lives? How do we do that? There I think it is central to what the Minister points out, namely how we work with the legal, in terms of having two parents, and the discussion we have had several times around the Family Court House when things go into a stalemate, and saw that, overall, we work with different ways we can work with social parents. Are there different types of grip on it? I don't think we're done discussing that. That's what I wanted to say. And then I have to read out a text for adoption on behalf of the Social Democratic Party: Proposal for adoption The Parliament recognises that there are families in which a child has not only two legal parents but also one or more social parents. The different family forms must be accommodated in our society. The Folketing is aware that the considerations to be taken into account in the rules on legal parenthood may be contradictory, e.g.: the right of the child to parents and to equality between parents, between married and unmarried and between same-sex couples and couples of different sexes. The Folketing supports that consideration for the child should be the general principle in the regulation of family law matters relating to children and not the consideration for adults. The Folketing therefore agrees with the government that the principle of two legal parents should be maintained. Taking into account the best interests of the child and the diversity of families, the Folketing urges the government to continue to work to support the diversity of society and the ability of families to adapt in different ways. • V 52).
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184529	Thank you, and that proposal for adoption will also be included in the further negotiations. And then there is a brief comment. Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184535	Thank you. I am really pleased that the rapporteur emphasises that, of course, there are families where there are more than two parents. But does the rapporteur not also think that it is a challenge that the child is not entitled to parents who are not legal, that is, that the child does not have the right, that the parent can take the child to the doctor, or, in the worst case, in the event of death, does not have the right to inherit from that parent or, in the case of high-level divorces, just not have the right to that parent? Isn't that a problem?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184609	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184610	Thank you for that question. In other words, as both the rapporteur and the Minister have made clear, I think that this is incredibly difficult. When you cut into your leg like that, I think there are two different things. One is about when it gets so complicated that you in the Family Court House, for example. must judge whether someone should have association and how they should feel. That's one thing. The second point concerns the other issues raised by the rapporteur: are there any other sorts of grip we can make on the future in order to bring about an adjustment to a modern society? That is also why, in our adoption text, we have said here that the government is required to continue to work to support the diversity of society and the ability of families to form families. So I don't think we're done. I actually think we need to get a look at where it is, and I think there are other ways to do it. That is also why we have tabled this proposal for adoption.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184718	Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184719	But I agree with that, and I also agree that it is quite a dilemma, and that it can be difficult, of course, it can be difficult in high conflicts. But these families do exist today and probably also experience divorces and conflicts within the family. What we have proposed in our adoption text is to start a study, both on the extent of this family type in Denmark, and also on what is possible to solve the challenges, so that you might be able to hedge it in, so that you are not just entitled to four parents, without making any demands or making sure that an agreement or all sorts of things have been made in advance. We can draw it in, and we can actually see some experience from other countries, so I simply do not understand why social democracy will not help at least to examine whether there are any possibilities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184805	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184805-2	Thank you. Well, it's actually a pretty good question... about how far we can go. I think we have to cut to the bone in relation to two legal parents. I understand this is gonna be a journey... something we're not over with. It's a dilemma, and where is it that we can make some gripes? Now I'm going to repeat myself, but I actually think we've been trying to hit it. And I would have liked us to have been able to agree more on a text, but I really think that when we add up the intentions and we end here today, there is a new direction for this area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184843	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315184845	I have to say that I do not like this whole thing so much that we call it so terribly dilemma-filled. There's something like that in it, like it's bad. I don't like it very much. But let's just park it there with high-conflict cases, which, fortunately, are a small part of all divorce cases. Then, as Mrs Astrid Carøe has said, there are a number of problems that these families encounter and encounter and which, when you talk to them, at least mean a great deal in their family, and are also bad for the children, for example. there is a parent who does not have access to Aula and cannot follow what is going on in there; there is a parent who cannot accompany them to the doctor; there is a parent who cannot take them away. So what about all the things that are derived from the fact that you are not more than two legal parents, apart from the high-conflict issues? Will the Socialists be involved in looking into whether you can be, for example, a member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament? Three on it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185009	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185010	As things stand now, we are not ready to have more than two legal parents. I think it is essential to make constant efforts to ensure that adults who are around a child have access to the information that is available. A comparable situation is, of course, about the work we are going to do around foster families, where there is also a problem with Aula. So the rapporteur puts a finger on one of the places that we need to look at with modern glasses when we have electronics when we have approaches in that way. So I sort of buy in on the premise that we have to keep practicing it. In fact, I am also buying into the premise of this at least as the rapporteur turns it into a dilemma. That's not what I meant. I know a great many different family forms, and it is not the family forms that are a dilemma. These are the challenges facing us when things have gone wrong, and I believe that the legislation must actually take account of those very places. That's where we can disagree.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185121	Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185123	There I just have to stick to the fact that I think it is unfair that more demands are made on those families than they make on the ordinary heterosexual couple. They are not required all kinds of agreements and good intentions about what they are going to do. So I don't think that's okay. But that just means that I can conclude now that we should look at whether a third, perhaps a fourth parent can be allowed to travel with their children, go to the doctor with their children, get into Aula with their children. Is there anything other than the thought of divorce, high-level conflicts that the Socialists find problematic with the legal recognition of more than two parents, or is it only the situation that is considered problematic?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185209	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185210	I can hear that the rapporteur is trying to get social democracy locked into such a corner, but I simply do not see it that way. I see, in fact, that our basic legal system is a safety net, and that if things go wrong, it is a safety net. Every day there are families who occasionally disagree and who have different structures, where you have to agree and where things are going quite well. These are families that are incredibly rainbow-like and that are not also the families that Mrs Pernille Skipper presents, but which are of a different nature, and that makes it slip. This is basically where things are not going well, and then we do not agree, and that is fair enough.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185259	The next rapporteur is from the Left. Here you go, Mrs. Marlene Ambo-Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185306	Thank you for the floor, President. And thank you to Enhedslisten for raising this question debate to give children the right to more legal parents than two, because it is a very important debate that we are going to have today, and it is about children, rights and responsibilities. There are today approx. 1,400 rainbow families in Denmark; this is a figure that I have pulled loosely from Danmarks Statistik, back from 2019. And you can actually say that when we take up this discussion on the big blade, this figure is supposed to be even higher today, because after all, this figure does not include everyone today, because there are more and more Danes living under a more untraditional family framework. These may be three parents, four parents, social parents, as others here have also mentioned today, stepchildren's parents or a completely different construction. For the Left, the family is at the heart of society. It is therefore also essential that society should be organised in such a way that families have the best possible opportunities to provide a secure environment for their children. This means, of course, that there must be room for family life to be organized in exactly the way that best suits the family. And if I may return to what I actually said at the beginning of my speech, I would say that this debate is actually about rights, about responsibility. That is why I am also surprised that the title of the question is to give children the right to more legal parents than two. Because who really gets rights with this? And in whose interest is it really that a child should have more legal parents than the two given? Is it for the child, or is it for the parents? These are three key issues that we in the Left are concerned with when we take this debate. Let me emphasise that this debate is about giving more rights to parents. It is also quite clear from the question text itself, namely whether parents' rights should be improved in relation to maternity leave, children's sick days, school-home conversations, etc. For more parents with custody, everything else equal means that more parents sit around the table when making the important decisions in the child's life. And after all, this will mean that the child's voice will also be lower. Therefore, it is also absolutely essential for the Left that consideration of the child's best always weighs the heaviest. This is true regardless of the carers in the child's life. Responsibility is important when we talk about children and rights, because if we open up the possibility that more parents can have custody of a child, then we must also demand responsibility for always putting the child's best over their own interests, and that is difficult. All good intentions can end in high-conflict cases in the Family Court House. This applies in general, whether the child has two, three or four legal parents, because it is no use having a team A and a team D parents, or for that matter a team C or D parents. All legal parents must be equal in terms of liability. For me, this isn't just about equality. It is also very much about giving more parties to the matter, that is to say carers in the child's life, a responsibility to the child. Take e.g. divorce cases or other family break-up cases: what is the position of the child if there are suddenly three or four parents to share, and there may even be a high level of conflict between the parents? I just have to say that I dread how the children's interests are being taken into account in these matters. We know it. The Minister and some rapporteurs also mentioned that it is known from cases in the family law field where two parents are to be separated. The high-conflict cases, the § 7 cases, are steadily growing, and unfortunately the times of the proceedings are also increasing, and while even more children are being squeezed between the parents' quarrels and the difficulties of cooperation, so the children are left as losers. That conflict and that situation can then just multiply up if you talk about three or four or more parents. Yes, I have to say: I do not know the outcome, but I dread the children's best, and so do the Children's Terms and the Ethics Council, which has also expressed their concern that with several parents it may become a slippery path. That is why we in the Left are also concerned. By opening up this opportunity for more parents to acquire legal rights over a child, there will still be a large number of issues that need to be clarified, for example. the question of how it affects children's upbringing, their self-understanding, their ability to enter into relationships when there are more parents than two inside the child. This has some consequences, and for that reason the Left would rather look at other solutions that ensure that it is the right carers who have responsibility and codecision in the child's life. Because we can in fact discuss the unfairness of the fact that there is no equality between two mothers and two fathers today, and this problem will undoubtedly lead to some improvement in this proposal from the Enhedslisten, but nevertheless there are also ethical dilemmas associated with this. We are potentially opening up if we give the green light to this, that more than two legal parents of a child can be registered. That is why it is not easy to give more parents the legal rights over a child, and that is why we in the Left are in favour of exploring ways and solutions to ensure that the right carers have a responsibility and codecision over a child's life, so that it is always, and let me stress it, for the child's good. I have to read out a text for adoption, and I will probably pick up a bit, because a lot of cross-checks and additions have subsequently been made, but it is on behalf of the Left, the Conservative and Liberal Alliance, and it reads as follows: Proposals for adoption The Danish Parliament is concerned to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live in the family constellations they want. The Folketing believes that the right and freedom of families to decide their own lives are high, and that it is therefore essential that society be organized in such a way that families have the opportunity to organise family life in the way that best suits the individual family. However, the Folketing believes that one should be careful to introduce a right to more legal parents than two, since such a right would not necessarily be in the best interests of the child, for example. divorce cases. In addition, the Folketing is concerned about a wide range of ethical dilemmas, including how more legal parents affect children's upbringing. The Folketing recognises that there are today family constellations which are not legally equivalent to traditional family types. Thus, the Folketing proposes to examine alternative options and solutions to ensure equality in untraditional family constellations, taking into account the child's best interests. • V 53).
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185938	Thank you. This proposal for adoption will also be included in the further negotiations. There are a few brief comments, first from Mrs Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315185946	Thank you to the rapporteur, also for some important recognitions during the speech. I see this as such a first step, and just the fact that we have the debate here in a respectful way, actually means, I think, that we are taking some steps in the right direction. I certainly hope so. At one point, the rapporteur says: the more people around the table when important decisions are to be made for the child, the less the child's voice becomes. And there I have to say, I was probably a little provoked. In other words, first of all, the recognition of more than two legal parents is not the time when it becomes a reality. Those families are real. They exist, they are real Where does the rapporteur get it from that they should not be able to find out?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190057	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190059	I think that the matter we have dealt with before we had this debate on the question, namely motion for a resolution No. B 66 about the Family Court House, clearly shows that all good, the best, loving intentions one has as a family, can unfortunately end up in a ditch when one is in a divorce situation. And I fully agree with the rapporteur on the Enhedslisten: there are no parents sitting around a table, whether it is two parents or ten parents who, as a starting point, do not want the best for the child. After all, the problem arises where what the parties, when they are split up, subsequently want is counter-productive. And in reality, it is a little absurd that this discussion should now take place, because we are among other things. Left, New Citizen and DF have previously shouted guard in rifle precisely in relation to these situations we have in the Family Court House, where you among other things. In fact, a number of the red parties recognise that situations can arise where a parent is removed from the child's life in order to avoid the emergence of these high-conflict cases. Now you want to add more parents to this situation, and it is perhaps a little contradictory and somewhat ambiguous to me.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190210	Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190212	Thank you. Well, that's what doesn't really make sense. May I start by asking the rapporteur to recognise that those families exist, in other words where there are more than two parents and that they serve as families? And then: will the rapporteur tell us where the rapporteur is from that there is a greater risk that those families will end up in high-conflict cases? Where did the rapporteur come from? For the rapporteur said that when there are more people sitting around a table, the voice of children is reduced. However, there is no evidence that these families are functioning less or more in conflict. It is not because I do not see that they can well end up in conflict, but there is no evidence that they are at greater risk of ending up in conflict. Or does the rapporteur perhaps have any reports that I have not been able to find?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190305	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190306	No, and I never said that either. In fact, I could sense that the Enhedslisten and the rapporteur have been out to say that one has such a feeling that these families are doing a great deal to process this in advance. And that is actually what I say in all silence: all the good intentions you have in advance before the situation arises that you are broken up as a family, you just can't count on what happens afterwards. And just as we get inquiries about the conflict cases in the Family Court House, I also get inquiries from these families afterwards, where they just have a conflict and where we actually have cases where there are children involved. Now I have some specific cases from my own municipality, where there are children in one family and where one child has three parents that the child is wandering around, and the other two have two, which means that these siblings are no longer seeing each other at weekends. It is because it has been decided to make that agreement in advance, and then I have to say afterwards that in this respect I simply do not need to expand this circle of legal parents.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190410	Thank you to the rapporteur. The next brief remark is to Mrs Astrid Krag, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190414	I think it is a pity that we did not get an answer to the question, whether there is a feeling that there are more high conflicts in rainbow families than in other families, but that is not really what I wanted to ask. I also think, like Pernille Skipper, that it is a little too bad that this debate is going to be very much about high conflicts, but one can sense that that is the concern, and I can understand it as well. We can see from other countries that there are some ways to fence this in. Whether you like it or not, there are some solutions, so that it's not everything or nothing, so that you just sweep it away and say no but that you can actually find some ways to do it. In Canada, in California, in the Netherlands, you work with different models where you make agreements in advance, and you ensure that only two parents can live with children if there is a high conflict. In California, it has even been done in such a way as to have to be approved by a court of law in advance. I think this is quite violent, but it is nevertheless an opportunity that would be better than the status quo, where these families that exist today are not recognised at all in our legal system. So I would like to ask the rapporteur whether it would not be good to pick up on some of the experiences from other countries and see if we can find a model that fits the Danish system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190527	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190529	In order to clarify the answer I gave to the previous rapporteur: is there a greater risk? No, of course not. But in principle, one case is too much. And just as the Children's Terms have some reservations about this, because you see precisely the cases and high conflicts that lie in the Family Court House, where there are some children who get terribly squeezed, I just have to say that on that point I am in line with the Children's Terms. It's just an ethically very, very difficult discussion to take. In relation to that, I think we should take a look at this with the adoption of stepchildren. This is something we have been through even before I became a social rapporteur and came over. Because today it's just one of these areas where we actually go in and look at these new family constellations and get better at securing just rainbow families. If you as a homosexual couple have lived together for 15 years, why should you still be in the system? So when the child is born, God help me be together for 21⁄2 years afterwards before you can apply for the adoption of stepchildren. This is just a good example of some places where we can actually move on and secure these rainbow families, because that is something we in the Left care about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190634	Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190636	It is wonderful and I fully agree with the rapporteur that we can look at the adoption of stepchildren and the whole possibility of co-faith that we are going to talk about a few weeks in connection with this citizens' proposal. That's just not what I asked. Could we not do a study on whether we can find some roads, for example? to look at opportunities for several legal parents, as has been done in other countries, that is to say, where you have just fenced it in and said that they and that stuff need to be done. It has been done fairly strictly, but it is, after all, a little better than today, and I just think it could be cool if the Left would back up having such a study and mapping out what the possibilities are.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190717	For the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190719	In other words, the Left is not in favour of us having a study of it. We would much rather look at how to ensure, among other things. Rainbow parents, and this will follow on from the citizens' proposal that will be coming in this Chamber in a few weeks' time when we can have that discussion. We would really like to look at how we guarantee fathers the same conditions, so that they are on an equal footing with co-mothers today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190739	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Socialist People's Party. This is Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315190750	Thank you. I think it is time for us to put an end to the many problems and leg buckles that rainbow families face in their everyday lives. Fortunately, we have taken quite a step in the right direction here in the Folketing, as the Minister has also mentioned. I am, for example. both happy and really proud that social parents can now also take part in the bar, just as I am very pleased that it is now easier to register as a co-mother. But unfortunately we are very, very far from achieving it. It must be time for us to put an end to this rigid notion that a real family consists of father, mother and children. For even though our family constellations did indeed look like this in the 1950s, we have entered 2022, and fortunately the landscape looks somewhat different today. We see more and more families, for example. consists of couples who have a child with another couple or with a good friend or friend, and the number of rainbow families is steadily increasing. So these families exist today. The only question is whether we want to give the rights that should go with it. Because they haven't followed, and there's such a need to gear society to handle these family constellations. As it is today, many rainbow parents experience great challenges both in their everyday life and in the law that other families do not experience, and I think that is neither reasonable nor logical. The minister brought the story of little Ida. Instead, I will tell the story of little Alma, where when she gets the flu, only her legal parents can take the baby's first sick day. If she's going to the doctor it's a little more serious than the flu, then it can be very difficult for her co-mother or co-dad to be allowed to follow her, just as her non-legal parents cannot be invited to school-home conversations or receive public mail about their child. These are all problems which rainbow families face in their daily lives and which have nothing to do with high conflicts. That's what ordinary rainbow families meet today. For me, as it is for the Minister and many of the other rapporteurs, it is absolutely crucial in this issue that children's rights to their parents are respected. Children in rainbow families risk losing all contact with their social parents, for example. Mom and her mother are divorced and her mother is not registered as a legal parent. In the worst case scenario, it can be hard for a co-mother to get custody in case Mom dies. I can't bear it. I don't think it's good for a child to lose contact with a parent. We know this, as Mrs Pernille Skipper also pointed out, from the research that is not healthy for a child. So it is whether you are registered as a legal parent or not on paper. The kids don't really care about that in their everyday life. Children need all their parents, and I think it should be the child's right. Then there are the high-conflict cases that take up a great deal today, and I can understand that as such, although I, like Mrs Pernille Skipper, think it is a pity that that is always what we should be talking about. I also listen to Save the Child and Children's Terms, which emphasize that it is important that we have the child's best interests in mind. That is why I think it makes a great deal of sense to carry out a study in this area, and that is also what both Save the Children and Children's Conditions say is needed, so get an examination of the scope and see what is possible, for example. to look at the countries that have taken the lead and made legislation in this area. What is the experience? How can we put it in such a way that, if there is a high conflict, children do not suffer and that proper solutions are found? Because, as I have stressed several times, these families exist today. This isn't about suddenly allowing them to be more parents than two because it's happening today. And fortunately for that. But it is about giving them the rights and giving the children the rights to all their parents. Therefore, we in the SF think that we should examine the scope of this and also examine what the possibilities might be of, for example. draw on the experience of other countries in this area. Children must have the right to all their parents and, at the same time, we must ensure that they have a secure and stable framework. But I think we can do the same if we have it properly examined and get the fence in how we can do it. We support the text adopted by Mrs Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315191239	It's noted. Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There are no requests for short remarks to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Christina Thorholm, Radical Left. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315191307	Thank you to Enhedslisten for raising the question debate about giving children the right to more than two legal parents. Families have many more forms today with the recognition of parenthood with several parents of the same sex. After all, recognition raises a number of issues to which no answers have been found and, as family rapporteur for the Radical Left, I am focusing on the legal certainty of the child and hence the right of the child and the equality of several of the parties who join the parenthood. The legal right to parenthood has an impact on the day-to-day lives of parents. Mrs Pernille Skipper has also repeated this several times, which in practice means that the close caregivers have problems especially in contact with the system and which do not support parenthood. The Children's Council sees a conflict in the legislation in force where the child is only entitled to two parents. The Institute for Human Rights attaches importance to the rights of the child in the United Nations Convention, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, like the Convention on the Rights of the Child, provides that the child's best should be given priority in all actions relating to the child. It calls for an important discussion on how best to accommodate the child. With the legislative procedure of L 65 on the possibility of e.g. the parenthood between a mother and a co-mother and a donor as home insemination recognized by the parents Radical Left, like the Institute of Human Rights, sees a question raised as to whether the child is entitled to more than two legal parents. P.t. The child is only entitled to several social parents and, unfortunately, this does not give the same rights to the adults or parents involved. In addition, we repeatedly see children and adults who want to know their origins, for example. in the case of adoption and in cases where one parent has come from a distance, and here several legal parents provide the children with enhanced legal certainty. We recognise that legal issues may arise when the child has several legal parents. We have just talked about the difficult association cases in the Family Court House, and we can imagine that some issues may arise with more than two legal parents, but we do not think that this should stand in the way of the basic possibility of giving the child more legal parents than two. We support the adoption text, in which the Folketing notes that the classic family forms with a mother and a father and their common children are no longer adequate for the reality in which most children and adults have grown up. Love does not know gender, lgbt families form and thrive, and there are children who grow up with parents of the same sex and with more than two parents. We should recognise this reality, and the Folketing took the first step by giving the opportunity to share maternity leave with up to four social parents. However, we believe that a study and knowledge sharing on the extent of rainbow families with children with more than two parents in Denmark and their relationship and the barriers they encounter should be initiated in order to adapt legislation so that more family forms are recognised.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315191646	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is no wish for short remarks to the rapporteur, and I would like to welcome the next rapporteur from the Conservative People's Party, Mrs Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315191703	Thank you very much, and thank you to Enhedslisten for raising this query debate. In the Conservative People's Party we would like to recognise the legal issues that may be associated with being in a family constellation that does not consist of a father and a mother. The individual and the family's right to control themselves and their lives are absolutely crucial. As new and more different family types emerge, it has only become more topical that we discuss the opportunity for families to live the life they want. However, ensuring the best interests of the child will always have the highest priority for the Conservative People's Party. That is why we are also concerned about the possibility of having more than two legal parents. Back in 2019 when Enhedslisten suggested that children should have up to four legal parents, the Director of Children's Conditions, Rasmus Kjeldahl, said, among other things, that Children's Terms do not believe that it is in the children's interest that so many adults can have the right to participate in important decisions relating to children's lives. In addition, we see a number of other issues about the possibility of having more than two legal parents. Since no ceiling has been set, one could, in principle, be in a situation where a child has ten different parents, who, for example, have to be separated and shared with the child. Then a 7-7 scheme quickly becomes difficult to do. We fear, therefore, that children can quickly find themselves in an extremely unfortunate situation, if for example. Ten parents want something very different for the child. In addition, it will also have a practical impact on a number of other legal issues which I think we owe each other to consider and discuss thoroughly. This applies in so far as a number of questions in the field of family and inheritance law are concerned, which I think we should have the opportunity to delve into the practical consequences of. However, as I said at the outset, the Conservative People's Party would like to fully acknowledge that there are today many different family constellations and that they are not legally equivalent to a family consisting of two parents. That is why we are also open to looking into how to ensure a higher level of equality in non-traditional family constellations. But the most important thing for the Conservative People's Party will always be the child's best interests. For this reason, we cannot at present support the idea of having more than two legal parents, and the Conservative People's Party supports the adoption text which the Left read out. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192005	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are a few brief comments to be made to the rapporteur, first from Mrs Astrid Carøe, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192011	Thank you. So I hadn't heard the one with ten parents before. Well, I've heard the slippery argument that then there'll just be more and more parents. But I would like to ask the rapporteur what kind of a Danish family the rapporteur has heard about where there are ten parents about a child.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192025	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192027	Now it was an example of a situation that could be if, for example, there were. more people are divorced along the way, and you are opening up the opportunity that is being proposed here with the right to more legal parents than just two. Then you can imagine that you could be in such a situation at some point.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192047	Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192049	One of the things we have proposed, for example. to be able to fence this in is that you have to do it before the baby is born, and there I have never really heard of that there were more than four people • most often it is two couples or a couple and a friend or friend. But please don't do this. I hear the rapporteur say that we would like to recognise that these families are at least families where there are four legal parents. How would you like to recognise it if you do not like to recognise it in a legal way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192119	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192121	Well, what I mentioned was that we can see that there may be some practical and legal issues about this, including family law, inheritance law. There it could also be something about child support, one could imagine. There may also be other issues that I can't think of right now, but there might be something about doing this. So that is at least some of what I see as a challenge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192146	The next brief remark is to Mrs Pernille Skipper, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192149	I would also just like to know where the rapporteur is from, that some people should propose ten parents. So this is a question debate; it is not a proposal. We ask if you want to recognise those families where there are more than two parents • it can be three, and that can be four, but I've never heard of anyone with more than four. So I really think it's to fake and ridicule this discussion, which is real and real. The rapporteur himself says that Conservatives would like to recognise that these families exist. Should we not treat it with the respect that we are not just pretending that there may be 10 or 20 parents about a child, but talking about the problems that those families encounter? They encounter problems associated with Aula, being able to travel, to come to the doctor. Are these problems that the Conservative People's Party will take seriously and also do something about so that those families do not encounter those barriers?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192245	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192246	But now it was certainly not the intention, at all, to ridicule anything, and if the rapporteur had listened, then we also recognise that there are these family constellations. And as the rapporteur himself says, this is a question debate and what I mentioned was an example.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192306	Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192308	It just wasn't really an example, was it? So that's a rather strange example. But now the rapporteur says that the Conservative People's Party would like to recognise that these families exist. How are you going to do that? For the Conservative People's Party will obviously not see to it that you can be three parents or four parents who have access to Aula; will not see to it that you can go to the doctor; will not see to it that you can take your child away with you. In other words, how can we recognise it, apart from saying that we know that they exist? Will the Conservative People's Party do something about the problems they encounter, or are they just words?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192346	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192348	After all, the rapporteur is putting a lot of words in my mouth, which I have not actually mentioned. I haven't mentioned anything about Aula or the other things. The rapporteur did, I did not. In fact, I said at the end of my speech that we are open to looking into how to ensure equality more effectively in non-traditional family constellations. In fact, that was one of the last things I mentioned in my rapporteur's speech.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192416	Thank you to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Danish People's Party, and that is Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192430	Thank you very much. In the Folketing we have just discussed motion for a resolution No. B 66, which dealt with sanctions against the parent who used to work with him, and that proposal was actually based on a very, very sad background. It is that there are far too many children who fail in the system by two parents not being able to get along and wage war against each other two times. The family courthouses are horizontal, and they have long waiting times because two parents disagree. Children are thrown around in 7-7 schemes and schedules for Christmas, Easter and summer etc., so that the association can be divided between two parents because it is two parents' right. Every divorce child is a divided child between two families, and none of us people were born to be throwing ball, but about half of all children end up like this because their parents couldn't agree to stay together and raise their children together. I'm running cold when I see this formula: more legal parents. In other words, more people who have a legal right to their child. What does it look like when four people can be just as hammeringly divided as two? A girl who, at 8 years old, is having a wonderful Christmas Eve with her father, and she gets a lovely piece of funny toys for Christmas, and next time she has to spend Christmas with her father, she will be 12 years old, and she will have come into puberty, she has kissed her first boy, and she no longer gets toy, she gets bras and thongs, and she is no longer father's little girl. How is one month between four separate divorce parents and everyone entitled to their children to be distributed? Should it be 1 week each in a month, or should it be 31⁄2-31⁄2 scheme? Poor children, poor children, to be reduced to an object which four persons have the legal right to be a pie that can be divided into four. We already have plenty of problems with children who are severely affected by the differences between two parents. In the Danish People's Party we see the world from what is best for small innocent children who cannot decide for themselves, not from the fact that it could be totally flower-power-many-fold if a collective owned a child together. That is why we cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192703	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. And the next rapporteur comes from New Citizens, and that is Mrs Mette Thiesen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192716	Thank you so much. I shall be very brief. We don't support this either. We certainly do not think that this is the right way to go, that is, that there should be more legal parents for a child. A child has two parents. Both the adoption of stepchildren is possible, and there is also the possibility of writing a children's testament if you are concerned about the rules of succession. So no, we cannot support that child having more legal parents. A child has two parents.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192745	Thank you to the rapporteur of the new citizens. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. I therefore believe that all the rapporteurs who wanted to speak have spoken. I can give the floor to the Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for the Elderly. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315192802	Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for a good debate, to thank the authors of the questions, and that is what the authors of the questions say, because they have called for this question. It is, of course, a difficult question which we can also hear there are several different views on. I can take down the fact that there is at least the support of the majority of participants in the debate for the fundamental principle of two legal parents to be maintained. There are several who have referred to the concerns of the Children's Conditions, but indeed also the Mother's Helper, have the flag in relation to children who get stuck. I fully agree that it is not the case that there should be some increased risk of you ending up in a high conflict, because you have an alternative family form for the classic nuclear family, as I think I defined it in my introduction. It is not the premise that lies here, but when we make our legislative framework, we just cannot take out of the equation that they must ensure the child also in cases where all the good intentions come short and parents cannot figure out how to be parents together. With that in mind, I would like to say that there have been many things in the discussion here too, many things that go beyond the discussion narrowly on legal parents. Questions have also been raised where it can be said that having parental authority gives access to some of the things that have been mentioned • medical visits, school-home conversations, Aula, travel etc. And in this way I think it is actually very good that we have been asked the question before the question by Mrs Pernille Skipper, which we are now uncovering, in relation to what really are too specific barriers. Because there is nothing to prevent a social parent, in agreement with the custody holder, from following the child to routine appointments with the doctor, in the emergency room, at events in the institution, at the school, etc., but part of this is tied to the custody holder. That is how the legislation regulates it, but the parental responsibility law is a framework law, and that is also why you can see, or apologize, it must not be said that Mrs Pernille Skipper here from the platform has referred that the minister has not been able to give a final answer to the question here, because we must also obtain the concrete assessment from the Ressert Ministers. It is not illegal for a doctor that it is the social parent who brings a child to the doctor. I would say that the question of data can only be resolved with a mandate from the custody holder to the social parent, but we need the right resort to help us respond to that. Similarly, the question arises as to when medical treatment is involved, where there will be clear limits, in relation to who can make what decisions. That is why we are now answering the question put by Mrs Pernille Skipper by obtaining contributions from the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Children and Education, from the Ministry of Health. In view of this, we will then have a better overview of how solutions to some of the problems raised here can be secured through various other ways, and we will therefore be able to have a discussion on a different basis in the future. So I would like to thank you for the discussion. I think the rapporteur for the questioners has said in a couple of rounds that this is what I do not know whether that expression has been used in a journey, i.e. these discussions and also the discussions that have led over time to some of the other changes in people's communities, which I have also been through in my speech that we have carried out and where we started with discussions somewhere, and I think that is very good. I would also just like to hope that we do not have to discuss, what can be said, places where we actually have better opportunities than what can immediately appear in the public debate, for example. The discussion on the adoption of places of birth, where the limit of 21⁄2 years can be waived if one has had an established relationship, up to the birth of the child when the adoption of places of birth has taken place. I am very sorry that this is the second picture that very often fills the public debate, because it will mean that some people go out there and think that this is the way it is, and they will refrain from applying for place child adoption, to which they have completely legitimate access, because they have had a established relationship. Similarly, there is the question of whether there should be discrimination against homosexuals and heterosexuals. It is, of course, a question of whether as a couple, independent of the gender composition of that couple, you have a legal status because we are talking about two legal parents that you do not have when we are out in a multitude of families. So it is not in this way a question of people's sexual orientation. But with that rounding, I would like to thank you for a good debate on a subject which is complicated and which I do not see as the last time we are discussing. I think it is a good thing that we are now initially getting contributions from other ministries through questions put to my ministry by Mrs Pernille Skipper. And then I will be completely open to the fact that it may well give reason to make sense to uncover it further.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193317	Thank you, Minister. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to the Minister before we give the floor to the rapporteur of the proposers. Mrs. Astrid Carøe, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193326	Thank you. I would actually like to ask the Minister if he would like to find out a little more about it. After all, I hear a lot from both the Minister and the rapporteurs about the Children's Conditions, and we are also very concerned about this in the SF, so that we ensure that the children's rights are guaranteed in this. And Children's Terms and Save the Child says there is a need to examine it further and examine the scope and what the possibilities are. But I heard the Minister say that right at the end, so I actually tried to sign off on the list of speakers, but I don't care.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193356	You can always say no to the floor for a brief comment. Nevertheless, the Minister must be given the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193401	Then I can just sign that the rapporteur has listened to us, and in the first place we have some questions which we are in the process of answering. It is clear that if you want a larger, wider cover of a kind, it could also sound like something that also requires that there is some funding for it, and then we cannot stand here an early Wednesday night and just shake hands on it. But the rapporteur certainly heard it correctly: first of all there is an answer to the question put by Mrs Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193430	Thank you, Minister. I can give the floor to Mrs Pernille Skipper, Enhedslisten, to wind up the question. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193440	I would like to start by saying to the Minister that it is Tuesday. Thank you very much for an important first debate, as the Minister also says. I think we are on a journey where there may be more parties to meet some of the problems that you encounter as a family with more than two parents. The high-conflict cases, or let us just say the potential high-conflict cases, because I am not actually even sure that there are necessarily some real examples, apart from thoughtful examples of Ida and Alma and all sorts of other cases, are really, very much in the debate. I am of the opinion that it is just as bad to have legislation as we do today, where, if this situation were to arise, a child would potentially have one parent ripped out of his life. We tell that kid, if your parents can't get along, you're the one it hits. That is why it is not in the best interests of the child that we do not have the opportunity to make the decision that is best for the child. Having said that, I also hear on the positive side that there is recognition that there are some barriers that are not appropriate. So, the examples of one parent not being able to take the children to a doctor, not being able to travel with his children, not being able to go to Aula and keeping up with what is going on there, not being able to take the child's sick day and all these things, are actually a recognition that we should do something about it. I think it's blood on my tooth compared to moving forward with better setting things up for families with more than two parents. We propose, together with the SF and Radicals, that we initiate a slightly larger study, including on the scale. In fact, there are no statistics on how many children grow up with more than two parents we do not know. We also do not know exactly what barriers they are facing; we have stories from them, but it is not completely unveiled. And nap me even if the Ministry makes a brave attempt to obtain contributions from all sorts of other resorts, it will not be completely adequate. And then we don't have any more knowledge about how these families actually thrive, and maybe we should start with that. Let's have a proper investigation. Soon a lgbt+ action plan will have to be drawn up. Let us get it into the action plan that we are at least looking at how we can make life easier for those families and, above all, for those children, all of which is all about. Thank you for the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193747	Thank you to Mrs Pernille Skipper. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur, and that is from Mrs Hjermind Dencker, the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193752	Thank you very much. I just want to hear the rapporteur's clarification: what is the illegal nature of what I did when I brought my sweet little nephew to Sweden in the New Year?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193804	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193807	There's nothing illegal about that, either, as long as you have a custody officer's license.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193815	Mrs. Mette Hjermind Dencker.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193818	Okay. So when the rapporteur says that they cannot travel with their children, how can they not travel with their children when I can travel with my nephew?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193827	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193829	Of course you can travel with kids who aren't your own. You cannot have them registered in your passport, nor can you decide on it yourself if you are not the custody holder. If the rapporteur has brought his nephew to Sweden without the consent of the custody holder, it is not legal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193848	Thank you to Mrs Pernille Skipper. That means that no one else has asked to speak and the debate is closed. As mentioned earlier, the vote on the three proposals for adoption will take place on Tuesday, 22 March 2022.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193907	The debate is open. The first rapporteur comes from the Social Democratic Party. Welcome to sir. Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315193933	Thank you. With this bill, we are implementing parts of the housing agreement of November, which ensure the establishment of the Joint Cities Fund, and the addition of 10 billion. kr. to the fund. The Fund shall, inter alia: ensure that thousands of new common homes are built. More specifically, the fund will provide 22,000 more general housing, including 6,000 more study homes, 2,000 particularly cheap dwellings; housing for a monthly rental of up to 3,500 DKK. In the Social Democratic Party, we believe that it is absolutely crucial that Copenhagen and other major Danish cities have a more mixed housing and housing mix. Not least, we must ensure that Danes with ordinary incomes can also live in the larger cities and live in the capital in the future. The draft law proposes 5 billion. kr. of a total of 10 billion. DKK added from the Nybygningsfonden, in the period from 2022 to 2035 will be translated into the period until 2031. The remaining 5 billion. kr. will be implemented at a later stage by the contract circle behind the housing contract. The following initiatives include: part of the agreement: loans must be available for land purchase in areas with high basic prices; it must be possible to grant aid for the acquisition and conversion of commercial buildings for general housing which can be encouraged to enshrine general housing units where there is capacity. In the Social Democratic Party we want to avoid Copenhagen ending up like other major cities in the world, where only those with the highest incomes and fortunes can afford to live. We must also live together in the future, cross-income, educational levels, ethnic origin and ensure that we can also meet in everyday life in the future, watch our children grow up with each other. Social democracy supports the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194124	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment, and it is from Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194129	Thank you. There are a lot of good proposals in this bill, and they can be implemented in different ways. There's, uh... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... there's... Some funds are devoted to congestion, and it is then a congestion that a department decides for itself, and the residents can gain an advantage from it. It could, for example, be done. It is a question of improving one's own home in exchange for issuing a stamp in which new general housing can then be built. That's really good. I am just wondering why the residential areas that are vulnerable residential areas and so-called prevention areas cannot seek that funding. After all, we can have some of these prevention areas where the homes may not be very good and where there are large free areas that residents may want to get rid of, for example. sell a lawn to get some better housing. But that is not possible with the legislative proposal that is here. There is a hearing answer which draws attention to that problem. I would like to hear from the rapporteur if this is not something that the Social Democrats would be looking at in a committee procedure, so if we should not expand the possibilities for housing areas which are vulnerable residential areas or areas of prevention to be able to apply for these funds as well?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194236	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194239	But there I am, unfortunately, burdened with still being relatively new in this area, and especially new when this agreement was reached. So there I have to refer to the Minister when he gets on the field later.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194246	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194248	After all, it is a good thing that my idea from the consultation note is not rejected, so I see this as a clear opening to the possibility of having a good dialogue on it, because I cannot actually find any argument against it. I am well aware that there is special legislation for vulnerable residential areas, but for these new areas of prevention I do not really see why they should not be accommodated. Now I can see that the Minister is thinking, so I look forward to something coming out of my questions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194318	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194320	Perhaps it was to interpret a little a lot, because I could not answer it, that is, that it was the same as that there was an open door, but let us wait and hear what the Minister says.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194331	Thank you, sir. Rasmus Stoklund. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Left, and this is Mrs Heidi Bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194340	Thank you. The bill we are discussing today is based on the agreement on the Joint Cities Fund, an agreement that the Left is not part of. However, in addition to the establishment of general housing at extra expensive addresses, the bill crosses several agreements and policy areas, from operating aid over the homeless to the islands. As I have said, the draft law is about the New Construction Fund, which was established just before the turn of the century, when the funding rules for general housing were amended in 1998. The new construction fund was intended to provide support for the provision of loans for the financing of new general buildings in order to strengthen the sector's self-financing. It was expected that up to 30 years would pass before the New Construction Fund would have funds of importance to contribute to the financing in the form of grant aid. It is clear from the comments to the original law that it was intended and it was expected that it would take time to reach it. This is due to the fact that the settlement of capital expenditure would only be expected at this stage to exceed the benefits of the borrowings and that the first loans would be out-of-date. But it wasn't supposed to happen that way. Because of the low interest rates, there is already about 1 billion. kr. in the New Construction Foundation. It is the so-called negative benefit subsidy paid by and paid by the general tenants of housing associations throughout Denmark. But the bill does not benefit all of the country's residents in the general housing associations. Instead, the Minister emptyes the Nybygningsfonden, not only the part that has laboriously already been saved by the country's general tenants, but also future payments paid by the general tenants, even as far as 2035 to take practical advantage of the largest cities by the establishment of general housing where market prices are high, including at central and attractive locations, as it stands, in the largest cities. So it is to put the public in the eye, that it should provide many new general housing. It certainly does not provide as much general housing as possible in and around the largest cities, for it is planned to build or transform where it is particularly expensive. Most of all, I wonder how the Minister can defend spending huge sums of money buying homes that are currently being used for private housing rental. It does not provide more homes, probably not a single, only very expensive general housing. The Minister does not solve the fundamental problem of building many more homes in and around the largest cities • many more, both owner-occupied and rented homes, and many more attractive smaller housing that is affordable. And what does the Minister really think is that the New Construction Fund will, as far as possible, be put into hibernation until 2035? Residents of the general housing companies then pay into the Nybygningsfonden, also in the years from 2022 to 2035. The fund is not dormant when it comes to the payments to be made by tenants in the general sector. On the contrary, the money has already been spent by the government and when the Nybygningsfonden is emptied, apart from 150 million. kr., how does it make it possible for the general housing associations to provide benefit support, according to the purpose of the New Construction Fund, namely to provide benefits for the establishment of general housing? The Left welcomes the smaller part of the bill, which contains elements relating to the adaptation of elderly housing, more general housing in the small islands and islands, as well as strengthened homelessness and a spade-stick towards a future simpler and fairer operating aid system. However, we believe that many flanks are being opened up by the present draft law. We're worried about the municipal economy. These are large capital ties, according to the economic impact survey. How will this affect the municipalities' economy, room for manoeuvre and future municipal policy priorities? We are concerned about the lack of coordination with the homeless. The social action is only planned for 2023, but this Agreement will enter into force in 2022. Add to that the Copenhagen municipality's criticism in relation to the realism of price levels, the number and size of the particularly cheap dwellings. The Left would like to have the calculations, answers and notes on which the agreement is based. The level of activity in the construction industry is towering, as are the material prices, and we in the Left are concerned about general construction. What's the minister getting the money now? What quality does the Minister and the general housing sector have for the money? How much green conversion and sustainable construction will the Minister, the general housing sector and the general tenants get for the money now? How much more of the already planned construction that can already be built within the current framework, should we expect to be suspended, mainly because of massively rising material prices, because the challenges facing the general sector are not being addressed right now? We also note that the Minister will provide a framework for operating aid for renovation projects. It makes sense with simplicity and clarity for operating aid and with greater governance. It was part of the Green Housing Agreement, but what does this first phase have to do with the implementation of renovation projects in general construction, and what does it have to do with climate and sustainability? There are a great many points on which we need clarification, but I look forward to a committee reading. And I'm sorry about the late hour.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315194950	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. It is a kind of forgiveness, since I did not interrupt the rapporteur. But there is a brief comment to be made to the rapporteur. It's sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195004	Well, I have no objection to pecking at the government, but it has to be said here that the bill that lies here is a bill that comes because there is a majority in the Folketing that has reached an agreement. So the government should not have all the credit or all the reproach for what is contained in the agreement. I think it's just black-eyed enough. I can follow the rapporteur's view that we need to build more general housing and that it would be very good for more to be built. Does the rapporteur therefore believe that it should be a state subsidy in basic capital which could help to ensure this? Because there are other ways of spending the money, that's quite right, but I really think we have a lot of good elements in this, among other things. the fact that you can get a subsidy if you want to recycle a building and build general housing in it, and that is, in fact, a green proposal. So does the rapporteur not recognise that there are a number of good elements in this respect, or would the rapporteur rather have that there was, as it were, a state subsidy for more general housing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195103	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195106	We are not interested in a state subsidy. And what was in the New Construction Fund when it was established is just self-financing. It is a good idea that has been put in there, namely to ensure that there is greater self-financing. But what worries me at the moment is that I did not remember to include the Enhedslisten in the agreement, or the other parties that have entered into it, is that we are actually standing and having the opportunity to do so, for example. The City of Copenhagen has the possibility to plan 25 per cent. general housing. But they just can't get through with it at the moment because there are increasing material prices in the building. So here you go in and say that you want to solve a problem, but some of the other problems that are at the moment are not being addressed at all. However, as I also mention, there are some small elements in this agreement that we think are positive. But there are also some questions that it raises, for example. This is about the homeless and about the time, that is, when you do one in relation to the other. We also know that this is important in relation to the success of helping the homeless.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195213	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195216	Well, as far as the homeless are concerned, there will be a bill relating to the changed homeless strategy. And then it's true that this bill starts in 2022, but it's to build some of the cheap little homes, and it's to put the rent down in some homes, so we're ready for another homeless strategy next year. So there is a certain logic in the fact that something is happening here before a law is passed that gives some other conditions for the homeless strategy in the municipalities, that is how it should be handled. So I really think it is not as black as the rapporteur proposes here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195248	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195250	I mean, I think this is black, because I think it is about how we ensure that we create housing with quality, including in the general sector. And there I understand from the parties to the agreements that the essentials are very specific locations, very central to some very expensive addresses, rather than trying to ensure that there is quality in the homes and that the sustainable part is not spared. This is one of the things the general sector itself is saying is a huge problem at the moment, namely that one must build in concrete instead of in wood. It is, of course, the latest that has come from the general sector. Perhaps I think that the Enhedslisten should also choose to listen a little to the general sector.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195329	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Socialist People's Party, and that is Mrs Halime Oguz. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195341	Thank you. I will probably be a little more positive than the previous rapporteur, because I would say that I am very proud of the housing agreement, which will mean that the municipalities will now have a better framework for building a lot of new and cheap housing throughout the country and especially in our largest cities. We have long fought for a more mixed composition in the cities, and we believe that this is what creates cohesion in our country. We and I also want a Copenhagen where the cleaning assistant lives side by side with the sales manager and where ordinary employees can afford to settle in Copenhagen so that they do not have to commute back and forth for hours in order to care for the children of the rich in Copenhagen kindergarten. That is why I am extremely proud of the agreement, which is a major step in the right direction. In fact, ordinary homes offer opportunities for those who cannot afford to buy an expensive apartment and who cannot afford to pay the very high rent, which is particularly characteristic of the private rental market. This bill translates several parts of the housing agreement. This concerns, among other things: on the 1.8 billion. kr., which was allocated to a new and extended land purchase scheme that allows all municipalities with high basic prices to grant a basic purchase loan for the establishment of general housing. The scheme was, in fact, a SF proposal and is a great victory for the many municipalities that have had to drop general housing projects in the past because of high land prices. Now it is only important that the government follow the land purchase scheme closely, so that we ensure that the municipalities have the right conditions of use. After all, it is important that the millions that we have set aside are actually activated for more general housing. In addition to the loan scheme, a number of initiatives are being implemented, such as: support the conversion from commercial buildings to general dwellings. And then money is set aside to support the development of more sustainable solutions in general construction. Together, the initiatives must make it easier and greener to establish more general housing. Finally, the bill also contains that part of the agreement which ensures a reduction in rent in 4,050 homes for the homeless. The aim is to enable a serious housing first-effort that we in the SF have long wanted. That is why I am very pleased that it is now finally possible to establish more homes for this particular target group. All in all, with the agreement we have created a better framework for general housing in Denmark, and the SF will of course vote in favour of the proposal. Having said that, however, I also have to say that right now we are in a situation where too many general projects are being dropped. Rising material prices have led to major problems for housing organisations in implementing a new building within the maximum limit. BL has examined the situation and it turns out that nearly three quarters of all planned general construction has either been completely abandoned or paused. This means that a great many ordinary homes are not being built right now, and I would therefore ask the Minister to make a serious suggestion as to how we can help the construction process get started again. With these words, I would like to thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195714	Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to the rapporteur, and that is from Mr Seligman. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195720	Thank you. I think it was a very good call, made by the rapporteur at the very end, for the Minister to find a solution. Well, we are on such a happy day here, where we are going to get something going for the next few years, and then we have an acute problem that needs to be resolved. I could see there that if now the conciliation parties met and looked at if this land purchase arrangement did not allow us to start using the money already now to meet some of the housing associations that have been offering tenders and that cannot be achieved with the aim of realising the projects. I mean, it's kind of crazy that we're about to be able to give an extra subsidy to housing associations that want to build on some expensive matricles, but some who have done everything processed and are ready to make contracts with contractors now will stop if we don't find a solution. And it may well be that the Minister has another solution, but I would really like to meet everyone in the circle and discuss whether within the five billion. kr. Here can find solutions. Can the rapporteur see any aspects of this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195823	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195825	Yes, I fully agree that we need to look at this together, because there are a lot of constructions that are simply dropped because of expensive prices on the material being used. So I would very, very much like to take a look at that, and I would also urge the Minister, as I also say in my speech, to find a serious solution to that. It is therefore not sustainable for us to want to build on the one hand more generally and, on the other, to have some projects that have stalled because it is simply too expensive. It doesn't make sense.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195902	The next brief remark is to Mrs Heidi Bank, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195905	Thank you for your speech, even if we do not agree. To say that there are quite a lot of housing organisations or new housing buildings that are in trouble is actually an understatement. Well, according to BL, it's 73 percent. of the planned construction work which is in trouble. It is a completely acute crisis, I would say. But that was not my question. My question is about the rapporteur saying that there must be access for all citizens with different incomes and that those with general income must be allowed to live with those with higher incomes. At least that is how I hear the rapporteur say it. Can the rapporteur tell me why, in the current negotiations on this agreement, it has not been emphasised by the SF rapporteur? For as it is today, there is not much difference between who lives in general housing and private rentals.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315195958	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200000	Thank you. I'm not quite sure I understood the question, but what I can just answer if I've understood the question correctly is that for us it's important that we live together. It is simply part of the cohesion on which Denmark is founded, namely that we live side by side, regardless of ethnic, cultural and social backgrounds. That's how we can lift each other up, and that's how we can help each other. And that is part of the cohesion that we in Denmark are so fond of and that I think we should safeguard. I do not want us to have cities that are only for the rich, while the less well-off have to live quite elsewhere, while at the same time serving those who then live in the big cities and commuting back and forth. I don't want a society like that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200052	Mrs. Heidi Bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200052-2	But does the rapporteur not forget that general construction in Denmark is not reserved for certain wage incomes? And that means, for example, that when you do... chooses to say that now we have 25%. In the large cities, it may as well be the director who lives in the general housing as may be the clerk or educator who lives there. But I just think I've heard the SF earlier address this agenda. So why is it that one has not chosen to include it in such an agreement when one has been sitting at the negotiating table? I mean, the Left wasn't invited to that negotiating table.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200132	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200133	What I just want to say, in relation to who can live in the various general homes, is that it is true that a director can also live in those homes, but the fact is that today the rent prices are so enormously high. That's one. The second is that there is simply not enough housing. There is simply not enough housing for ordinary families and students to afford to live in the big cities. And then I would have wanted the Left to be there. I can't sit there and treat that way, but I wish you had been there and not been so negative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200224	Thank you to the SF rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Radical Left, and that is Mrs Susan Kronborg. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200238	Thank you very much. The proposal here concerns the establishment of the fund for mixed towns. It is an implementation of the agreement on the establishment of the fund for mixed cities of 26 November 2021 concluded between the government and the Danish People's Party, the Socialist People's Party, the Enhedslisten and the Christian Democrats. Radicals particularly welcome those parts of the bill which take account of disabled people and their opportunities to live in general housing. We welcome the fact that greater attention is being paid to older and Community-oriented devices which can help to reduce loneliness. The draft law translates the agreement reached between the parties to the agreement, of which Radicals are not part, but we in the Radicals are particularly aware that the agreement states that subsidies for the construction of new general housing in the four municipalities of the island and the municipality of Bornholm no longer follow the first come, first served principle, but are determined on the basis of a concrete assessment of the projects. We're so happy about that. Radicals do not support the bill, because we believe that the part that goes to sustainable knowledge sharing does not meet the ambitions of Radicals, and because the construction of the 22,000 general housing does not make sense for Radicals, while at the same time requiring the demolition of general housing in stigmatised areas. Radicals would like to see the number of general dwellings demolished according to the Ghetto plan compared with the 22,000 general dwellings planned for construction. Furthermore, Radicals would like to know how much CO2 thanks for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200438	Thank you to the radical rapporteur. There is a request for a brief word of thanks to the rapporteur, and that is from Mr Seligman. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200446	Well, we are also from Enhedslisten's side against the homes being torn down into other residential areas. You can go and be mad about that every day, but now and then the chance to make a good new deal, I think you should do it. I have tried to understand the radicals in this matter, I am glad that the rapporteur of the Radicals has outlined the good elements of the proposal. I would like to say that the allocation of 100 million has been made. kr. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the development of something more sustainable is a good thing, and it is my view that the rapporteur of the Radicals helped to increase that amount during the negotiations. So I find it a little difficult to understand why the Radicals did not choose to join the agreement after having had an influence on it. And if the Radicals do not think it is green enough, I would like to point out that there are many green elements in the recycling of buildings and a grant of 675 million. kr. to enable the buildings to be reused. Then the rapporteur cannot elaborate on why the Radicals did not agree to the agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200550	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200551	Thank you very much for the question. Yes, it was really Radical's king's idea that building on such a large scale, i.e. 22,000 common homes, was a great opportunity to make knowledge sharing in relation to sustainable construction. That was the wish that led us to end up having the ambitions that we had during the negotiations, also because there is a huge potential for exports. This building can actually become, as the Left has also pointed out, the new wind turbine adventure. It wasn't exactly those words, but it's like that in the neighborhood at least. And yes, that's right, sir. Soren Egge Rasmussen that Radicals are angry about the ghetto package every day. It has fallen into our lot and is our job to be.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200702	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200704	I really feel for the Radicals, if every day they're mad at what happens to bad things in here... then you can have it hard. In terms of knowledge sharing about sustainable construction, it is not possible to demand that all companies share all their knowledge with others, but of course it is good to share some knowledge. And then I think it is a little strange, since we have a national strategy for sustainable construction that introduces some CO2 so I have not come to understand the Radicals, but I understand that the Radicals are apparently pissed off at the ghetto laws.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200746	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200747	Yes, that is quite correct. And I would also like to say that there are a great many good tactics in the agreement. It has also been the experience of Radicals that the debate that has taken place has been very fruitful at many levels, and there has been a great deal of consensus on many fronts and areas. So I would like to take this opportunity to say that at least we Radicals are very happy to have achieved a piece. But, as I said, we radicals are so pissed off every day, especially because of the ghetto package.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200832	Thank you to the radical rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Enhedslisten, and that is Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315200844	I think you have to try to hold on to the good mood when you're going to survive in here in the Folketing. I think it is gratifying that we have here a legislative proposal which ensures that we spend 5 billion. kr. on the short track for more general housing, and that we have also said in the agreement that it is the parties that are included in the agreement that will make a follow-up agreement of 5 billion. kr. And then I hope that a majority will be maintained in the Folketing with so many mandates that we can move on. I think that there are a great many good elements here, and I think that one of the good things is that you can get a grant to use existing buildings. It is then described in the bill as business premises, but it is, in effect, broader than public buildings, such as buildings. a nursing home that has been left over, or a hospital that can no longer be used for that, so there are really some conversion opportunities, and I hope that municipalities and housing associations are looking at what they can get from positive things in this agreement. Because you shouldn't just do what you used to do, you have to do something new. I also think it is very good that we should secure really cheap housing so that we can adopt a law on a new homeless strategy and, from the start, be sure that there are some housing that those people can pay for. I also think it is good that we have ensured that there is a possibility of more general housing on smaller islands. There are some islands that have a migration potential and where it is actually difficult to find a home. And living in a general home can be a way to test whether you can live in an island community more than a summer • that can basic housing be a really good solution. The 100 million. kr., which is devoted to developing sustainable construction, I think is really important and useful to have. Then maybe there's an element that's a little overlooked, and that's about the stuff with the sealing. It is actually described very well in the bill; it is the departmental meeting that has to decide whether to give up a parking lot or a lawn for something potentially new construction. And the money that comes in on it will go to the housing organization according to the current rules, but with this bill, it goes in and can be for the benefit of the residents who leave a parking lot or a lawn, and that money can then go to improve housing so that you can lift a residential area. That is also why we on the part of the Enhedslisten say: why is it that it cannot be extended to the vulnerable housing areas and the prevention areas? I do not think that enough solutions have been provided in relation to the areas of prevention. There you have just decided in a law that there are some people who can't move in. Yeah, so what? Has it been solved? No, you don't. And I think there are some of these areas of prevention which have a standard of housing which could well need a boost, and there it would be a good thing if they had the right to decide whether there were any land that they would give up in order for them to have better housing. Then we have this dilemma or not a dilemma, but we have quite a large amount of money for the land purchase scheme. And there I would like us to look at what opportunities there are in committee. I have full respect for the agreement, that is, the parties behind this law. Of course, we have to meet there and see if this is something the parties think is worth opening up, so we spend some money on something other than what is in the agreement. I think we have a huge problem with the fact that we are on the way to adopting a good legislative proposal, and then we can see that there is some planned construction that is not being implemented now. And if you look at BL's inventory, it's specifically 825 homes that stand to be dropped. These are projects on which gunpowder has been used, the site has been found, the supply has been kept, but it cannot be made to stick together. I think we should find a solution there. But if the Minister has a solution other than to start spending the money we agreed on in this agreement, then I think that is fine. So the Minister has to come along with that. We have tried to get it into the Finance Act, but we have not succeeded so far. I think that, overall, this is a very good legislative proposal, and I think that there are some elements that can grow, for example. the creation of an office to help municipalities meet the wishes of more communities. There are quite a lot of seniors who do not want to live all alone, but who demand a general home in a community. And that is probably one of the things we need to build more of and where we have not allocated specific money to it, but we have set aside money for it to be described what the barriers can be. And, of course, it is also a wish on the part of Enhedslisten that some of the barriers will be removed if it is the case that major problems for communities are identified. I know a lot about it and know that there are problems with what side activities you can have in a housing association. And it might be possible to relax a little.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201352	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment on the Enhedslisten's rapporteur, and that is from Mrs Heidi Bank, the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201358	Thank you. I know the rapporteur as one who is concerned both with the sustainable agenda and with the fact that there must be as many general housing as possible. That is not where I myself stand; I think that there should also be general housing with a lot of other types of housing. But in relation to that, I am just a little surprised that Enhedslisten can defend an agreement in which geographical location, i.e.. very, very expensive addresses are much more important than quality in housing, to ensure sustainable housing in materials that are exciting, sustainable and innovative, and to ensure that you get more for this money, which is of course money paid by the tenants. Now it has been decided that the money that has not even been paid by these tenants will be spent many, many years in the future and that it must be centralised. They do not go to the whole country; quite a bit is actually given to the rest of the country and to the islands, because where the basic price here can be used is in the big cities. So I'm just wondering if Enhedslisten doesn't care about the number of homes here, if you think there should be cheap housing for many people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201510	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201511	After all, the rapporteur has not followed the Enhedslisten in the negotiating room, but what we have negotiated is the number of cheap housing. This applies to both these homes, which are newly built and which will cost 3,500 DKK. in rent because there is a special subsidy, and also the existing housing where the rent is reduced. We've got this through in these negotiations. Then I would also like to point out that the recycling of a building for general housing is something that applies throughout the country. There you can just search. The 400 million. kr. for sustainable construction is also some money you can just seek. Then it is true that in relation to this land purchase loan there will probably be a predominance in the metropolitan area, but it could also be Aarhus or other municipalities. So I do not think it is fair to say that it is quite wrong. This agreement, which is behind the bill, is much less biased than the proposal from the Social Democrats to the negotiations. So I actually think that we are more parties that have negotiated it in a direction where the province gets more than it did in the government proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201617	Mrs. Heidi Bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201620	Thank you for your answer. Following on from this, I would like to hear where the rapporteur is in relation to the criticism made by members of the rapporteur's own party in the City of Copenhagen, who say that this is not going to result in the number of dwellings set up at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201638	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201639	I don't fully recognize that. I have only met Members who have been very pleased with the agreement we have reached and I look forward to all the municipalities, including Copenhagen, being serious about what can be achieved from this agreement. This is best seen when we have reached the third reading of it, but I think there are some who listen and follow what we are opening up to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201706	The next brief remark is to Mrs Susan Kronborg, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201711	Thank you. I would very much like to hear what the rapporteur thinks about what the Danish Students' Joint Council points out in their consultation reply, namely that it would like to see a slightly more firm wording in the draft law to commit the fund to sustainable solutions for general housing. Does the rapporteur have a comment on that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201739	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201739-2	Well, we have, of course, with what we have agreed in the agreement on the National Sustainable Construction Strategy, made sure that from 2023 there are stricter requirements in relation to CO2 so I think we have actually dealt with that in another agreement. What I think is really good in this agreement is that we have formulated in soft terms that we need to look carefully at solving the youth housing problem both in Copenhagen and Aarhus. I can have some doubts about the size of the problem, because I have learned that, for example, there is a problem. in Aarhus have been vacant youth residences. So perhaps, as a follow-up to the agreement, we need to clarify where we stand; it is also influenced by the fact that some foreign students may have found it not attractive to be in Denmark and have home study, and that one might as well be in the European country one came from. But there is probably a little missing an analysis of it in order to look deeper into the overall picture about the need for youth housing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201845	Mrs. Susan Kronborg.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201847	I am not going to reply on behalf of others, but, as I recall from the course of negotiations, 8 000 study homes are missing in Copenhagen, but I also remember what the rapporteur says, so that it is not in Aarhus that housing is lacking. It's in Copenhagen. Then I would like to know whether the rapporteur has a position on what the City of Copenhagen is also proposing that the scheme to promote sustainability in general housing should also place emphasis on certifications.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201928	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315201929	Yeah, but it's fine. We have, of course, seen increasing demands on construction, as agreed in the agreement we have reached on the strategy for sustainable construction. If a municipality in its own sustainability strategy wants to impose higher requirements on what is allowed, then the municipality can go for it. So sometimes we cannot secure everything in the legislation, but I actually believe that the tightenings we have made in the agreement on sustainable construction go well far, and if a municipality wants to go further, then you can demand it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202007	Thank you to Enhedslisten's rapporteur. Then there are no further brief comments to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Conservative People's Party, and that is Mrs Gitte Willumsen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202030	Thank you for the floor. With Bill L 136, the Minister, together with the parties to the agreement, is trying to solve a challenge in the housing sector, as we in the Conservative People's Party basically agree there is. As a country, we have a challenge with our housing stock, which looks somewhat different than the population composition is going to look beyond time. There will be more and more seniors, and thus there will be a lack of housing, where accessibility is paramount and where communities can be grown in new ways. We also basically agree that housing for homeless people is lacking. We would very much like that part to be negotiated with the government. We have pointed out several times in discussions with the Minister for Planning that we want to focus on unbalanced housing or temporary housing for socially vulnerable people. So here we think we have a common cause. We agree with the objective, but certainly not with the means that have been found here. Our criticism concerns the part where the government, together with the parties to the agreement, wants to expand the proportion of general housing at the expense of other types of housing. We are glad to acknowledge that there is an ideological dividing line between us and the government in relation to how much of the housing stock should be general and built with public subsidies rather than being run by private people. We are concerned about how the rest of the housing market will respond to the purchase of certain residential properties for general housing purposes. We believe that this will mean a price increase on ordinary occasions, because it risks pushing prices on the remaining part, as there will be fewer homes with free market price formation. Having said that, we agree that there is a need for more housing that can contain crooked existences. That part will not be regulated by the market, and that is where we as a society must focus on helping those people who cannot enter into and settle in ordinary rental homes. We would like to take that dialogue with the Minister, but we cannot support this bill with the financing model and the buying-in options created by the parties to the agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202317	Thank you to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Danish People's Party, and that is Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202339	Thank you, President. The Danish People's Party is part of the agreement, and thanks to the Minister for an exciting course we may well call it "in the course of the negotiations." We support the intention of the agreement, which is, of course, to create more mixed cities. It is always good for the hash smoking hippie to meet the hardworking craftsman. We support this project and this agreement with the help of this 5 billion. kr. Over the next few years, towards 2031, it will help. I shall not repeat what many honourable Members have said. I would, however, like to highlight two points. One is that the government's proposal at first was somewhat wrong in terms of funding, because the majority of the money from the tenants and from the funding went to the capital, but by common help and good arguments we convinced the government that it might be better to have a model in which it was reasonably suited to the payments from the affected areas compared to what they then received, that is, a geographical balance. We are very pleased with this and thank the Minister for that. Then I would also like to highlight the two pools for the islands, which have also come in. That's not very much money. That's 2 x 10 million. kr. One pool is for the small islands, and the other pool is for the island municipalities and for Bornholm, which is a large island municipality, and this simply means that, for example, there is a lot of water. In the small islands now becomes the opportunity to build general housing. This will in the long term make it easier for some to make the decision to move to the small islands. Today, it is a huge decision, because you have to invest in a home and you are not sure that you can keep it, because you also have to earn some money in order to keep it. But here you get an opportunity to move to the island, live in an apartment and see if it's something for you, see if you can make it add up financially, and we're actually quite happy with that. Then we are also pleased that the islands will have an opportunity to have some general housing. It is also a tool for attracting more people. So all in all, we really think that this is a quite good agreement, and I hope that more than the parties to the agreement will then support the bill when we reach the third reading. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202629	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur and it is from Mrs Heidi Bank, the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202633	Thank you. I would also like to say that it is positive that the Danish People's Party has been involved in this, and I think that it is probably only on the initiative of the Danish People's Party that the islands have been considered in this. I think that's really good. But does the rapporteur not see that there is an imbalance in this agreement when it is the general tenants of the whole country who pay for something where, at the same time, we know that there are a great many villages and rural areas around Denmark, for example. Is there a shortage of elderly housing, general housing for the elderly, and that is not part of this agreement, that is, that housing is given priority primarily in the large cities, and where it even seems that there are some very expensive addresses to go in and prioritise? Does the rapporteur not see that it is a little strange if you know where the Danish People's Party usually stands?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202726	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202727	Yes, and the rapporteur does indeed have an important point. What has happened in recent years in large cities is, of course, that a left-wing majority has created urban development which has made it very difficult to live in cities. For example: is there in Copenhagen 60%. co-operative housing, 20 per cent. general housing and 20 per cent. owner-occupied housing and because there is only 20 per cent. Owner's homes, they're really expensive to get. So if among other things... The Enhedslisten had provided for a development in which there had been more owner-occupied dwellings, so it would have been cheaper to buy a owner-occupied dwelling, or it could have been ensured that there were more general housing and even general housing that were smaller. So what we are really doing here is that we are going in and remedying a problem created by the left-wing majority in the big cities themselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202821	Mrs. Heidi Bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202822	Thank you, and thank you for the answer, and it may be that I heard a little wrong because the acoustics in here are bad. What is true, however, is that the rulers in the large municipalities have not given sufficient priority to the owner-occupied dwellings in my view and also to the opinion of the Danish People's Party. But you may in fact also have priority for private rental at that expense, and you may have divided opinions about that. But perhaps that is not where you will then have an opportunity to save in your own home. How does the rapporteur view the priority given to private rentals rather than owner-occupied housing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202905	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202905-2	We are actually in favour of everything: private, general, owner- and cooperative housing. There just has to be a good balance, and in the big cities it has been neglected. With this agreement, we are going in and remedying it a little bit, so that in future we will have a little more mixed towns, which I think is a good thing for all of us, because it also has an effect on the children who then go to the folk schools in the respective neighbourhoods. In other words, if the areas are mixed, the primary schools will also be socially mixed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315202942	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. I do not see any more rapporteurs present in the Chamber, and so I can give the floor to the Minister for Home Affairs and Housing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315203013	Thank you for the debate and the discussion in reality, both to those who support it and to some of those who are also sceptical. Of course, I've had a lot of thoughts about what this bill means and how it's turned into something. For it is clear that when we sit and negotiate, there can be many different reasons why we want to have general housing for people with ordinary wages, including our largest cities. I can, of course, be, and I think there were some people who noticed that during the negotiations, such a bit of concrete social democracy in the term, and I stand by that because I believe it is a strong tradition to build cheap housing. At the same time, there are also requests from the left. Enhedslisten has party members who believe that 100 per cent. of all homes must be general, and that is a slightly different approach perhaps. On the other hand, it can be said that the Danish People's Party has had a very national focus, and the idea that as a Dane you should have the opportunity to live in your capital, which you do not have in many countries, because foreign funds and participations have bought the cities completely, is certainly an intention with which I fully agree, and which I think you should stretch very far in order to succeed. And the green transition, which has also come in from several parties, has meant that this agreement has become significantly better than what I had as my starting point. So I would like to begin by just expressing my sincere thanks to the Danish People's Party, the Socialist People's Party, the Enhedslisten and the Christian Democrats. Thanks for backing up and joining us. I think it is a very good deal and one that makes a difference in terms of how our cities evolve and what coherence we have here in our country. I also have a slightly smaller one, but I would nevertheless like to thank the Radicals for being along the way and enriching us in the discussions. I am, of course, sorry that in the end perhaps there were some things in which one could not quite see oneself, but I also hope that in the Radical Left one will consider whether all in all this is an improvement that is large enough for one to see oneself in it too. We are implementing a political agreement, as they say, and it is in fact a series of proposals that we have made over a number of years. This applies to both big and small, but this is one of the big ones. We have a number of new opportunities to build general housing so that you can live in our cities, no matter what income you have, so that you meet people who are different from you, and get some other impressions than those you might agree to on a daily basis. I think that is healthy, and I believe that it helps to create a connection like people who are important and who make it possible to succeed in some things that could not otherwise be achieved. If we are to succeed, and if we are to continue to do so, I think it is also important that there should be more general housing. It is the cohesion that lies in the fact that those who may have a little more difficulty also have the opportunity to live in some of the places where it is expensive. It must not just be something on the outskirts of the cities, for those who have the hardest, but also something that is a broader offer to people. We try to do away with the divided city, which is also in Denmark, but the more if you go abroad. If you go to Stockholm or London, you will see how the cities are completely divided, both ethnically and socially, and it is for me to see a horror situation to end up in, also for Danish society. In concrete terms, we are implementing an overall framework of 10 billion. kr. Up to 2035. In the first place, we take half the frame, and we spend 1.8 billion. kr. under the land purchase scheme. This is probably one of the longest words I have used here in political work, but basically it means that where there are very expensive reasons and where we need more general housing, you can get a loan which will then have to be paid back at some point, but from this fund. Then we're gonna set up 870 million. kr. for the conversion of private rental housing into general housing and 675 million. kr. to convert commercial properties. After all, these are schemes which I believe will be used throughout the country for commercial buildings, even in many smaller towns where old commercial buildings can be converted into ordinary homes. Then there is a major element that is about homeless people or people who are at risk of becoming homeless. We're gonna set off about a billion dollars. kr. to secure 4,000 particularly cheap accommodations with a rent of 3,500 DKK. on a monthly basis, and we hope that this, together with the social measures, will help to reduce the number of homeless citizens or citizens who are at risk of staying without a home. I think it is important that we also build on some of the experience we have here, among other things. from Odense Municipality, which has succeeded very well with it, and that we get it taken out to the whole country. Then it is also important to emphasise that the whole legislative proposal is not just about the big cities. As has been mentioned, money has been allocated to the small islands and to the islands, for example. Bornholm. It's a little smaller, but at the same time there are clear targets for how the geographical distribution of this money is to be translated. I would also like to mention the issue of operating aid from the Landsbygningsfonden, which is being paid out in connection with renovation projects and where we are creating an overall framework for it. Similar management is also provided for the Landsbygningsfonden's renovation aid scheme, which is to ensure better practice in the administration of the operating aid scheme, so that it becomes more transparent and more efficient use of the funds. The proposed framework has been established on the basis of the operating aid granted by the Landsbygningsfonden for the last 10 years, so it is on the basis of the figures we know and the conversion areas will not be included. Thank you for your good reception and thank you for the debate. I think that the rapporteur of the Left has said many things that are factually wrong, but I think that I can hardly list them in the time I have left. So if anyone is listening out there, I would urge you to follow it at least if you were to have rooted in it one way or another. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315203705	There are brief comments. First, it's sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315203706	Well, the Treeman from the Enhedslisten has one question for the concrete social democrat, that is, the minister. We have received an inventory from BL which pointed out, as it were, that there is a rather big problem with the construction that is planned. Some of this is something where tenders have been made and where I think we owe it to us to come up with a solution; because it is not quite a happy day today if we do not find a solution for the construction in progress when we only take care of the construction that will happen shortly. So I really want to hear from the Minister whether he himself has a good solution or whether the Minister will convene some discussions in the conciliation circle, because of course it must be all the parties involved in the agreement that will have to meet on this matter to see if they can find some way, for example, of finding a solution to this problem. spent some of the money allocated to the basic purchase scheme to support the construction that has been put out to tender.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315203812	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315203813	Well, I kind of agree that there is one, you might say, short-term challenge with the maximum amount. In other words, the maximum amount will be regulated by the building price index, so if building prices increase, the maximum amount will also be regulated accordingly. But it is clear that there may be a situation which now exists where building prices have risen a great deal, but that statistics have not yet recorded it, and that the upward adjustment which took place here on 1 January will not be enough in relation to what really is on the market. We have asked for figures and we are still working on what we have got in. I have seen the folder made of BL, and it is not because as such I am in doubt about the figures in it, but there are very different solutions, also in relation to the percentage that should then be raised and for which groups of dwellings etc. I think that a general swelling, for example. Twenty per cent, as some have mentioned, will drive the rent in the general housing sector up, and that would be dangerous.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315203918	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315203919	Well, I haven't suggested that it should be up by 20%, but if the Minister has any good creative solutions, it's time for them to get on the ground. I hope that the Minister will invite parties to discuss this. The second question I have is about this congestion contribution that residential units can apply for. The draft law states that it is limited to the exclusion of vulnerable housing areas and areas of prevention. I miss a good argument as to why the residential areas should not seek that money, for that can be done, for example. This is an area of prevention which has just come on that list and which actually wants to improve the residential area but has difficulty in doing so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204001	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204002	Of course, I also heard this in the context of the rapporteur's round, and I would say that for some of the most vulnerable residential areas, if we go to Vollsmose, for example. However, it is of course worth discussing whether it could be made up in the prevention areas, one can say, and could change the rules. I think that is an entirely open question, and I imagine that we can also discuss it in the context of the agreement that exists.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204036	Then it's Heidi Bank, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204037	Thank you. I believe that what is more political disagreements with factual errors is the case, otherwise the Minister will normally be clear enough to address it. But let it go. I am glad that the Minister has also seen this (the speaker presents a leaflet I think it is totally alarming reading when you go through it. I would like the Minister to comment on something. It is not, of course, large amounts that have been set aside, but I recognise that an amount of the 5 billion has been set aside. kr. that is set to be used initially in the agreement. BL argues here that in almost two thirds of the construction work being carried out, savings have had to be made that challenge quality, including environmental measures such as: meeting the standards for environmentally friendly wood constructions that are converted into concrete, etc. etc. Can the Minister not see that there are some problems in the general housing sector at the moment because of the situation we are facing in relation to the price of materials where action is needed now?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204147	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204148	I think there is a double bottom in the Left's suitcase when, on the one hand, we say that it is not alarming that the 25-percent rule for local plans that we adopted, and which the Left has also helped to adopt, is not being implemented, that is to say that people are sneaking around, and that is in principle irrelevant, and we do not care whether we can build general housing in the large cities and provide subsidies for it. You don't think that matters. But when you have a situation where, due to a short-term problem, you find it difficult to set up housing, it is said to be alarming. There must be some weighting of the proportions in relation to the terms used. But I would just like to say that in terms of saving on construction, I really think that it is very healthy in many construction projects that, in the course of a process, one wonders whether we can make this cheaper in some places than it originally was. There are many processes in this life that you live, where it's very healthy to try to see if you can save a little bit around. But it is clear that if it is generally the case that there are a lot of wood constructions that are converted into concrete construction, then of course we have a challenge. I also recognise a hundred percent that there is a short-term challenge with the maximum amount.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204254	Heidi Bank, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204255	I'm glad to hear that answer. I would also like to say that this is the Minister's interpretation of what he thinks the Left should think. In fact, the Left believes that it should be possible to build the 25 per cent. We are fully behind the agreement that lies in the law of plans, but what the Minister wants is for the private to pay for the general, and that is where we simply believe that there must be transparency in who pays what. And I am, in fact, convinced that private individuals would rather build for the general public, but it is of course a question of not carrying money from the private sector. So it was just a small comment on that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204333	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204334	You don't carry money for private people. The basic selling price or building price that you get on the general building is fixed, so it is of course set in the price that is for a cadastral. This does not change the fact that, when the Left is against us being able to impose on the developer actually compliance with what has been democratically adopted, and that is against the bill, it is the same as saying that we do not really care whether it is respected with the 25% that we adopt, and then you can say that you do not care if general housing is being built.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204407	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is over. I propose that the bill be referred to the Home Affairs and Housing Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204432	The debate is under way, and first it is the Minister for Home Affairs and Housing. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204441	Thank you. Then the procedure is turned around, so I get to start here. The Danish People's Party has put forward a proposal that only Danish citizens can vote for municipal and regional elections. This is contrary to EU law and to Denmark's obligations under international law, and on that basis I regret to say that the government cannot support it. As the rules are today, nationals of other EU and Nordic countries have the right to vote in municipal and regional elections under the same conditions as Danish nationals. These rules are linked to the fact that EU law requires EU citizens resident in Denmark to have the right to vote in municipal and regional elections under the same conditions as Danish nationals. When it comes to aliens other than EU citizens and Nordic citizens... that is, the so-called third-country nationals... their right to vote is subject to the condition that they have lived in Denmark for at least four years prior to the elections. The right to vote for third-country nationals for local elections is governed by an international convention of the Council of Europe, which Denmark acceded to in the year 2000. The Convention obliges Denmark to grant the right to vote in local elections to any foreigner under the same conditions as a Danish national. However, a claim for a previous residence in the country may be made for up to five years. The Convention applies directly only to local elections and not to regional elections. There are, overall, two important reasons why the government cannot support the resolution. One is legal and the other is political. Firstly, the proposal is contrary to both EU law and Denmark's obligations under international law. The government will not, of course, be involved in adopting rules that are contrary to these obligations. Secondly, the government believes that the current rules on the right of foreigners to vote in municipal and regional elections are appropriate. The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, our fundamental values and our common recent history, and it is therefore good for integration that foreigners can take part in the electoral process and help influence political life in municipalities and regions. At the same time, however, it is a matter of finding a balance so that not everyone with their foot on Danish soil will be able to vote for our choice. And it is precisely in the balance that the requirement for how long you as a third-country citizen will have to live in Denmark in order to vote for municipal and regional elections was raised in 2019 from 3 years to the current 4 years, and this happened among other things. with the votes of the Social Democrats. In this way, we ensure that the right to vote goes hand in hand with a certain knowledge and a certain attachment to Denmark. To sum up, what I have also mentioned is contrary to EU law and to international law obligations, and in addition, the government believes that the current rules on the right of foreigners to vote in municipal and regional elections are balanced and appropriate. We cannot therefore support the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204715	Thank you, Minister. There are no brief comments, so we will start the rapporteur's round. Then it is Mrs Birgitte Vind, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315204736	Thank you for that and thank you for the floor. Normally, I would start my rapporteur's speech by thanking the authors. I did so just over a month ago when the Danish People's Party proposed to introduce binding referendums in the municipalities. And, as I said at the time, we in the Social Democratic Party are very, very much in agreement that our local democracy must always be fertilised, and it must be developed. On the other hand, I do not want to thank you this time, because we do not agree at all with either the concrete proposal or the intentions behind it. The Danish People's Party has tabled a motion for a resolution contrary to EU law and Denmark's international obligations to ensure that resident foreigners who fulfil a number of conditions can vote in regional and local elections. In other words, the proposal cannot actually be implemented. At the same time, at a time when democratic rights are being kidnapped and people are fleeing from a brutal superpower that does not accept democracy, I think it is a bit grim that we should witness a proposal being put forward in the Folketing which actually deprives people of their democratic rights. The right to vote and to stand as a candidate in municipal and regional elections for EU nationals is governed by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which provides that any citizen of the Union residing in a Member State of which he is not a national shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in municipal elections in the Member State in which he resides, in the same way for nationals of third countries, it follows from the European Convention on the Political Participation of Aliens at local level that the participating States are obliged to grant in any foreigner the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to local authorities, provided that he fulfils the same legal requirements as apply to his own nationals and that he has been legally and habitually resident in that State for not more than five years prior to the elections. And in Denmark we have the rule that we all know, namely that we have set it at four years. It is not just anyone who can vote, and we believe that four years is a reasonable limit. I cannot understand why it is felt that it is damaging to local democracy that foreign citizens who live, work and pay taxes and have lived at least four years in Denmark should not be part of our local democracy. If we have the expectation that these very people will be involved in our society, then that must also apply to democracy. We usually say, "Do your duty and demand your right." Both must be present. We must remember that democracy is one of the finest things we have, and we must safeguard that. Taking away the opportunity for citizens to contribute to democracy with their voices in my optics is devastating to the cohesion of a society. The proposal is anti-democratic. Dear DF: We are in a time of gathering, not splitting. We must develop our democracy, not restrict it. Social democracy cannot vote in favour of the proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205047	Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Kristian Thulesen Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205049	Thank you. I had actually decided not to take the floor along the way here, but just follow up at the end in view of the time. But frankly, Mrs Birgitte Vind, to describe it here as cruel and anti-democratic, because we are discussing the extent to which foreign citizens should have the right to vote in Danish elections. I could ask Mrs Birgitte Vind if it means that it is also cruel and anti-democratic that these foreigners, who are in Denmark, do not have the right to vote in a parliamentary election?
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205122	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205123	As when the Danish People's Party last made a proposal for democratic participation, I am always prepared to discuss how we can allow people to participate democratically. So you can always discuss whether you should have it. Now the rules are like this, and these are the ones we have to follow.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205142	Sir. Kristian Thulesen Dahl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205143	Yeah, that wasn't an answer. If it is cruel and anti-democratic to talk about whether some foreigners in Denmark should have the right to vote in local elections, is it also cruel and anti-democratic, as Mrs Birgitte Vind said, that they do not have the right to vote in local elections? Birgitte Win this... yes, finally, let me get the answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205207	Mr. Kristian Thulesen Dahl finished? Kristian Thulesen Dahl Yes. ) Good. Then it's Mrs. Birgitte Wind. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205212	Thank you. Excuse me, sir. President, I got a little too eager. After all, this is not about the Danish People's Party giving people rights, it is about the Danish People's Party depriving some people of democratic rights, and that is where I think the difference lies.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205230	Then we thank Mrs Birgitte Vind and move on in the rapporteur's line to Heidi Bank, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205238	I have to say that I am standing here today on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left, Anni Matthiesen, and reading her speech as rapporteur, but thank you for the floor. Who should have the right to vote in this country? We have asked ourselves this question in many different ways over the years here in the Danish Parliament. This is not even the first time we have seen a motion for a resolution from the Danish People's Party with the desire to restrict foreigners' access to vote in Denmark. Nevertheless, it is still such a proposal that we have to deal with today. The Danish People's Party wants only Danish citizens resident in Denmark to vote in local elections from the forthcoming elections in 2025. This means in practice that the Danish People's Party wishes to lift the right of resident foreigners to participate in local democracy in their local area. For a number of reasons, we in the Left cannot support this. Firstly, we believe that it is actually right to have a local democratic voice when you have lived in this country and have behaved properly for four years, as the rules are today. Secondly, the proposal of the Danish People's Party is contrary to EU law and our international obligations. Indeed, every citizen of the Union has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in municipal elections on an equal footing with nationals of the Member State in which he resides. It is simply in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that discrimination against nationality is prohibited. When it comes to third-country nationals, we are obliged to offer all foreigners the right to vote in local elections if they meet the same requirements as we impose on our own nationals and have been legally resident here in Denmark for the last four years. For these reasons, the Left cannot support the proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205442	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. We move on to Jan Bjergskov Larsen, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205448	Thank you, sir. President. Let me start my rapporteur's speech by talking a little about community. An association with the community is an important prerequisite for being able to take care of one's own safety and that of others. In Denmark, we have a strong community and thus a solid foundation for creating a society in which no one experiences standing out against his will. This requires us to work together as individuals and organisations across state, market and civil society. The text I have just read is from the SFI, the National Research Centre for Welfare, and I think that all parties in one sense or another can support it. When you feel heard, you become happy when you are involved, you become obligated, and when you have rights, you take on duties. When you don't feel heard, you get angry when you don't feel involved, you get frustrated, and when you lose your rights, you don't care, and at worst you fight those who have deprived your rights. The arguments put forward by the Danish People's Party say, among other things, and I quote: It is absurd that foreigners, many of whom come from countries in the Middle East with no knowledge of democracy, should have the right to vote. Others have only a peripheral connection with Denmark and Danish society and have little knowledge of the Danish language and domestic policy issues. The Minister mentioned earlier that this is contrary to EU law and conventions, so I will not spend any more of my rapporteur's speech on that. But I would point out that democracy is not something to be taken for granted, but that it is something that must be constantly worked on and cultivated. In order to be able to participate positively in a democracy, a citizen must be able to feel appreciated. Democracy is vulnerable, and if the understanding of democracy is that some citizens should be deprived of their rights because, in the words of the Danish People's Party, they have too little knowledge of Danish language and domestic political issues, then, in my view and in the view of the SF, it will be an act that is in direct conflict with the common intentions that I know that both the Danish People's Party and the SF are fighting for, namely that local democracy should be strengthened. It is a social problem if we exclude parts of the population from political influence. We must combat parallel societies, and one of the tools is one of them. to get people involved in democracy. It is best for people to feel that they have ownership and a share in the society in which they live, and you can do that. get through a turnout. With the proposal, the Danish People's Party will strengthen that there are citizens in Denmark who will not feel heard, involved and accepted. This shows very clearly that their priority is to deprive a group of citizens of a democratic duty and a democratic right solely for religious reasons and that it is more important than ensuring a society with a strengthened community and a strengthened democracy. Therefore, the SF cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205750	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and since there are other democratic tasks to be solved, Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens, has been allowed to take the lead in the rapporteur's line. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205759	Thank you so much. A Danish citizenship must be a prerequisite for the right to vote in Danish elections and thus for democratic codecision over Denmark. It should be a matter of course. Unfortunately, however, this is not the case today when citizens of EU and Nordic countries, on an equal footing with Danish citizens, can stand and vote in elections to both municipalities and regions, and where also foreigners from third countries obtain this right after four years of residence in the country. The right to vote, which gives direct democratic influence, applies even to foreigners who have come here from countries and cultures without tradition and understanding of freedom and democracy, and this applies to foreigners who do not even master the language or share common Danish values such as: gender equality. We have heard examples of gender-separated election meetings in foreign languages from the municipalities of the country, and in elections after election the Ethnic Minorities Council publishes a leaflet explaining how to vote in English, Bosnian, Arabic, Turkish, Polish, Romanian, Farsi. Urdu, tigrinya and Somali. During the 2021 municipal and regional elections, a total of 414.966 foreigners, equivalent to approx. 8.9% by the voters both stand up and vote and thereby help determine how approximately three quarters of Denmark's total public economy is prioritised. It's simply crazy. This is not how to protect and preserve Denmark. Denmark is the country of the Danes, and that is why New Citizens naturally fully support the motion for a resolution on the abolition of voting rights in municipal and regional elections for non-Danish citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205939	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief remarks and we go back to the series of speeches. So this is Mrs Christina Thorholm, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315205950	And that is the opposite, because the Radical Left cannot support the abolition of the right to vote in municipal and regional elections for people other than Danish citizens. Municipal and regional policy is about decisions in the immediate vicinity, and here we believe that people who live in the municipality and the region should continue to have the right to vote because it supports our democratic society, and that is a model that we salute so strongly. Today, the legislation is such that EU citizens and citizens from the Nordic countries have no waiting hours, but that people from third world countries do not have the right to vote until after four years. It was the Radical Left against that when this tightening up from 3 to 4 years was introduced in 2010. Radicals believe that voting creates an understanding of democracy and the society in which we live and that it is therefore important that we do not change the rules as the DF suggests. We believe that we can promote democracy by providing more information on voting rights in municipal and regional elections, so that more people become aware of the importance of these elections and gain more insight into Danish society. That is why we do not support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315210103	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and we move on to Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315210110	After all, we live in an internationally marked society, and we are in the Enhedslisten in favour of the people living in Denmark having the right to vote. I can't help but think that on Samsø we have a mayor, and when he was elected mayor, he was Dutch citizen. When we saw in Denmark relaxed the rules so that you can have two citizenships, he then applied to also become a Danish citizen. Then, as mayor, he was to shake his hand when he was to be admitted as a citizen. He couldn't do that, and then he had to go to Aarhus to shake hands with another mayor. He has then been re-elected mayor of Samsø, and he has two citizenships. I cannot help thinking, when I have such examples, what is the problem? And if I think about which foreigners I know, I know a lot of people who contribute a lot to Denmark. I know an American who has been one of the best lobbyists in Denmark. He still lives here and has children and participates in the community. I was also thinking about where I live, trying to make a list of where people come from. I do not think about that much in everyday life, but I have committed neighbours who come from France, Hungary, Sweden, the United States and England. That is the short list of the countries I just remembered. I'm not going to think about where they came from. I judge them more by what they do and the commitment they have in their everyday lives and in the contexts in which they are part of. I am sure that it is important for a great many to be able to vote. That is also why some people are now applying for dual citizenship because they really think that it has been discriminatory that they could not vote in parliamentary elections, despite the fact that they have lived in Denmark for very many years. Now this resolution is only about regional and local elections, but there too I think there is an important task in ensuring that democracy is also for those people who do not have Danish citizenship. It is against this background that the Enhedslisten cannot support this motion for a resolution at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315210321	Thank you to the rapporteur. We move on to Mrs Birgitte Bergman, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315210330	Thank you for the floor. I really would like to start with a little personal story. For approx. 63 years ago a lovely young Swedish woman took the ferry from Sweden to Denmark. She fell in love with a Danish man and never returned to Sweden again. They married and had three daughters, and for over 40 years this woman has worked, paid taxes, lived in the community, has lots of friends and lots of cultural activities and has not least contributed to Danish society. The woman is my mother, who is 87 years old today, and she has voted every time for local elections over all the years. But today the proposers will change that if they get a majority. The authors of the motion wanted to see the right of foreigners to vote in municipal and regional elections abolished, so that the right to vote was reserved only for Danish nationals. With this proposal from the Danish People's Party, it must also apply to our Nordic citizens and EU citizens. We have some special obligations to these citizens, which is why it is fair that they can take part in local democracy. In addition, Danish citizens are typically also allowed to vote in local elections in other EU countries. Today it is the case that, after a certain period, foreign nationals have the right to vote in local and regional elections, but not in parliamentary elections. Now I'll tell my mother that she can't vote for local elections... and I'll lose my voice... and that she can't participate in local local democracy... despite having contributed to it all her life. Everyone legally resident in Denmark is affected by municipal policy decisions and should therefore have an influence on this. Overall, I believe that if you live in Denmark and contribute positively to your community, it is fine that you have influence on local democracy. Local democracy is for example. where there is a look at how much money should be given to a school where you might have your children, etc. It is not the general legislative parliament that the Folketing once is. We should also bear in mind, moreover, when it comes to EU citizens, that Danish residents in another EU country also have the right to vote in local local elections. So if I moved to Germany, had children and put them in a local school and engaged myself in the local community, then I would also be happy to be able to engage in the local German elections that had an impact on my everyday life. Therefore, this will also potentially affect Danish nationals abroad inappropriately. The Conservative People's Party cannot therefore support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315210608	Thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur I see is the draftsman of the opinion of the authors of the motion for a resolution, Mr Beyer de Ryke. Kristian Thulesen Dahl, Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315210619	Thank you for that, President. First of all, let me thank all the rapporteurs, of course, but also ask Mrs Birgitte Bergman to send a great greeting to her mother. If I can make that sort of calculation, I think it was 40 years since Mrs Birgitte Bergman came to Denmark, or how was it? 43 years, maybe? I'm sorry, 63 years old, yes. But we are back for a while at least that is what I wanted to come to as a point, and that is also mentioned in the comments on the motion for a resolution. In fact, it was said that now there was an arrangement in the Nordic countries where voting rights could be exercised in local elections, because we thought that we were very close, that we were similar and that it was quite natural that we also had a large exchange across national borders. It was also stated in the comments that 35,000 foreigners had the right to vote in local elections in Denmark in 1981. See, this is probably a situation that is so to be dealt with. It is probably not a very challenging situation, even for such a fundamental democratic view, in relation to who actually has responsibility and thus has to have influence. And there I could mention in parentheses the Social Democrat rapporteur, who speaks of right and duty, and that is true. I could also talk about influence and responsibility. Who is actually fundamentally responsible in a country? It's the citizens of the country. So from 35,000 in 1981 we have come to the point that in 2021, when we had municipal elections last November, we are talking about 415,000 foreigners who have the right to vote in local elections in Denmark. Well, almost 9%. of the voters in the elections in November last year were foreigners, and that is what I think surprises a great many Danes that we have come so far. And then we can discuss whether we should not also have a more fundamental discussion as to whether this is a development that should simply accelerate, even in the years to come, or whether we should really find ways of trying to limit it here. There I think there is a difference between a guaranteed really good Swede coming to Denmark in the 1970s or when it was, and having the right to vote there in 1981, and then the situation we are in now. We all know very well that there is no reason to pretend to each other that today immigrants in Denmark are a very, very broad group. It's not just from countries around us that look like us. It is also from countries that are so dissimilar to us. And there is also a tendency for foreigners in Denmark to gather in different places, based on where they come, in some municipalities more than in others, and then it is clear that then you also have a greater opportunity to exercise your influence there and make that area think more in the same direction if you want to. In our view, this is a challenge for our democracy, and it is not a question of us not being strong supporters of the community and cohesion of a municipality, of engaging, and so on. However, I have the idea, and it is true, whether it is within the European Union or outside the European Union, that if I moved to a local election to Austria or to Hungary, or where you could now move, and thought that a few months after you moved there, you would have to exercise your right to vote in a local election, it would not be certain that your conditions were very good at doing so. It's not even certain you know the language. It is not certain that one understands what kind of election campaign is being conducted and what sort of arguments are being put to the market. And I know that in many places in the municipalities you can go to find brochures about soon everything between heaven and earth in all sorts of different languages, but that is not the way a local democracy behaves. That is why, of course, you can say that if you have lived in a country for a very many years and are an integral part of the local environment, you have a different option than if you have immediately moved in. However, we do not even have a discussion today about the fact that, for example, we are dealing with the question of the right to vote in local elections, the right to vote in local elections, the right to vote in local elections, the right to stand in local elections, the right to stand in local elections, the right to stand in local elections, the right to stand in municipal elections, the right to stand in municipal elections, the right to stand in municipal elections, the right to stand in municipal No, you just come here, and then you have a right by these rules. That is why we really want us to have a discussion on this. Now, if nothing else, we will be dealing with our motion for a resolution here, B 56. We're getting a little committee reading where we can discuss it. I am, of course, fully aware that it is possible to say that this proposal cannot be supported because, as the Minister mentioned at the outset, it is contrary to EU rules and international law, and I shall come after you, and we will soon be no higher than we are on grounds of rejection. However, I also think it was a little to the honour of the Minister that a political debate was also held on the subject, in other words on the position to be taken, and there I am so glad that the Social Democrats voted in favour of it, when we in the 2009-10 assembly got through the fact that we moved the career period for non-EU citizens to vote from 3 years to 4 years. I understand, then, that we simply hit the spot because the rules we have today are just the right ones, and I am glad about that. Then it may be that at some point we will have the opportunity to pull it up to five years, which I understand international law offers the opportunity to do. It could be a step in our direction. But you could turn it around. In other words, with the arguments put forward by many rapporteurs here today, one might well wonder if the parties at the same time agree that the four-year waiting period before voting is a good idea, because it might as well be argued, with the words of many rapporteurs at least, that there should be no waiting period at all, even for non-EU citizens. But it's probably still because you have the idea that it might still be very good that if a person comes to another country, there will be a few years when he can find out how to move around the local area, that he may just know one or two, that he has been down to the inn once and see what life is going on in the local environment and all those things. And then we are already discussing why it has to be four years and when it is really ready as a foreigner to exercise this democratic influence that lies in it when you go to elections and then you can discuss whether the five years would be enough at all. We do not think so, but that is what the international rules do allow us to do. In any case, it can also be said in relation to the European Union that the more Member States come, the more there is a likelihood that someone will come to an EU country which is still quite distant from the democratic traditions of that country. So summa summarum I think that is a good proposal, of course. I think that everyone should review their views on this and come up with a way of supporting it in the end. In any case, however, I think it is a good thing that we should have a discussion of what is really needed in order that, as a foreigner, we can exercise our democratic rights and do so in a proper way, so that there is a link between influence and responsibility in the future, including in local elections in that country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315211333	Thank you, sir. Kristian Thulesen Dahl. There are no brief comments. No one else has asked to speak and the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on the Interior and Housing. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220315211347	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Wednesday, 16 March, at 3 pm. 13.00. I refer to the agenda that will appear on the Danish Parliament's website.
