ParlaMint-DK_20220209130226	The first question is to the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and that is Mr. Torsten Gejl, the alternative, which is the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130238	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130243	Thank you, President. In principle, does the Minister think that it is okay to collect large quantities of blood from pregnant animals repeatedly only to produce a product that can be used to make industrial animal production more efficient?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130301	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130303	First of all, many thanks to Mr. Torsten Gejl to raise this problem. In the video from the Animal Welfare Foundation, which we have seen in the media, it is depicted how pregnant jumps in Iceland are bottled for blood with the aim of producing the hormone preparation PMSG for, among other things. Danish pig industry. And I have to say that the way in which production is carried out is appalling and totally unacceptable. I understand from agriculture that they were not aware of these grotesque conditions either, and that there are in fact artificially manufactured alternative preparations. Now I would like to invite the industry to a meeting where we can talk this through, and I would also like to address the Minister for Health, in relation to whether we can back a ban at EU level. In this respect, I note that last October the European Parliament called on the European Commission and the Member States to prohibit the import and production of PMSG derived from the blood of pregnant mares. We need to have that looked at right away! Let me also stress that such treatment, as we have seen on this video, of these horses and other animals, is not legal in Denmark. The treatment is contrary to some of the most basic provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and the Animal Health Act on the sound and caring treatment of animals. I can also inform you that PMSG is not produced in Denmark. If that were the case, it would require authorisation under animal testing legislation. As I understand it, the preparation is only used to a limited extent in Denmark to induce heat in lakes that have not shown a normal heat. However, it can be problematic enough in itself if conditions are as critical as what we see in these very, very boring and repulsive recordings.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130504	Here you go, sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130505	Thank you. As the Minister himself says, there have been so-called blood farms in Iceland and other countries where pregnant mares are being bottled too large amounts of blood used to produce the fertility hormone PMSG. It is a hormone used to make pigs pregnant in the Danish pig industry. The Minister has seen the footage, I assume, from the Icelandic blood farms occupied by the Animal Welfare Foundation, which has just been published and which shows that the horses are being abused. I mean, it's footage that shows that there is serious abuse of the horses, where they, among other things, are. are beaten over the legs with iron pipes to be reworked into a fold. How widespread does the minister think the abuse on Icelandic blood farms is, and what does the minister think about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130556	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130557	As I also mentioned in my first answer, it is something that is prohibited in Denmark. The fact that this is happening to the extent that we have seen here in Iceland was not something I was aware of. And I also understand from agriculture that they were not aware of it. We need to look into it. I understand that there are alternatives, so let us try to see if we can inspire agriculture to use them instead, and whether, if it is to take place, it cannot happen under far more reasonable conditions than what we see in the video.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130624	Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130625	Does the Minister think that it is okay for us to import a fertility hormone into the Danish pig industry, which cannot be produced in the European Union, as it is not allowed to draw blood from pregnant mares with foals? There must be a reason why we do not want it in the European Union. So we do not want it in the European Union, but we would like to import it. What does the Minister think is the reason why we do not want this type of bottling in the EU and in Denmark?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130658	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130659	As I mentioned before, there has of course been the assessment that it would not be allowed in Denmark and that it would not be allowed in the European Union. This seems to be happening outside the borders of the European Union, and that is why there has also been a proposal in the European Parliament to ban its use here. We need to look at this and we are going to do it now, because we cannot have animals treated like this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130725	Then the final question from Mr. Torsten Gejl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130727	In Switzerland, it is now intended to ban imports of this horse-blood-based fertility hormone into the pig industry. Should we not do the same in Denmark? Now that it is forbidden to produce it and we really do not have an overview of how many of the Icelandic blood farms are being abused by pregnant mares, is it not reasonable to ban it immediately?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130748	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130749	That is exactly what I am going to look into. As I mentioned, I will engage in a dialogue with our Minister for Health. I will look at what is being done in the rest of the European Union and then we will have to look at how we are doing this in the right way, so that we avoid this kind of cruelty to animals. We cannot accept that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130807	The question is over. But, I almost said, we'll continue with the same crew with the same minister and the same questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130813	Here you go, sir. Torsten Gejl, for reading the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130816	Does the Minister think that next year we can already eat Danish eggs laid from chickens without broken breastbones, on the basis of the Minister's representations to the Council of Ministers in the EU?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130830	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209130830-2	Again, thank you very much, sir. Torsten Gejl to focus on this important issue. We also had the opportunity to discuss a similar issue here last week, and that is really important. So, as I have said before, I believe that breastbone fractures in laying hens are a huge problem for animal welfare. I have gone into this matter as soon as I heard about it, and in November I took part in a big meeting on breastbone fractures with Danish egg producers and organisations of interest, and in December I raised this issue with the Commission and my fellow agricultural ministers in the European Union, who were pleased that, as the first, we raised the issue here. The crux of the matter is that the breeding of hens is governed by a few foreign breeding companies, as I understand it: one in Germany and one in France. And here lies the primary problem. Chest fracture is a common problem in the European Union, which requires common solutions, and that is what is being worked on now. I received broad support from the other EU Member States for a common EU action. This means that the Commission will now include breeding in the new version of EU animal welfare legislation. I'm in close dialogue with the industry, and we need to focus on the area. It is in every way an unfortunate situation, and it is my clear opinion that the industry takes the problem very seriously. They're really sorry about this, and they want to get rid of it. But the problem is complicated and it takes time to find the right solutions. That is why, unfortunately, whatever I wanted to say, it would be unrealistic for me to say right now that we can guarantee that eggs can be eaten without involving these complications even next year. Because it's the case that by far, by far, most of the chickens we have are bred like this, so it can't be any different. So you just can't, unfortunately, whatever you wanted to do to make it look different. It is a whole breeding programme that needs to be changed. That is what we are going to do immediately, and we want to act as quickly as possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131031	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131032	Thank you for your answer. We understand the Minister's answer here and now and to that answer, Mr. Rasmus Prehn came along when I raised the issue last week that the Minister does not think that the industry can do anything itself, but that it is the breeding programmes of the two major breeding companies that need to be changed. We also understand that the Minister has contacted his colleagues at EU level to include this challenge in EU animal welfare policy in order to influence the large breeding companies to breed hens, so more than 80%. of them do not break the sternum when they lay eggs that we eat for breakfast. And on the one hand, that's good news. It is incredibly good and timely for the Minister to move on to this. On the other hand, we really don't know if this is going to move anything. So, instead of looking at what we are doing in Denmark, the matter is now placed in the European Union with some people we do not know, with a timetable we do not know, and in a process that is difficult to follow. We can therefore sit down and wait for something to happen within some years or so down in the European Union, and we do not think that is satisfactory enough. I would therefore like to know whether the Minister can be more specific. Is there an action plan for the EU action that the Minister has been so good to launch? Is there a deadline? When will it be included in the EU's animal welfare policy? How can we follow the process? Can the Minister guarantee that this will be resolved within, for example, the area of security? 5 years, or otherwise guarantee that it will not be 10 or 15 years before it is resolved?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131159	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131200	The most concrete thing that can happen in this is that those who breed these laying hens change the genetics that are, so you get relatively larger hens laying a little smaller eggs, and you're doing that, as I understand it, because you're sorry about this problem. That is where the problem lies and there is where the European Union must push. Compared to what is going on out there with each egg producer, no difference can be made. You've tried it at a time when you thought it was the sitting pin that made you break this sternum, to remove it, but it didn't help anything, because it has nothing to do with it. It's just the breeding of the hen that's screwed up so badly that it provokes this breastbone fracture.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131240	Sir. Torsten Gejl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131240-2	I do not feel quite confident that there is help on the way to these millions of chickens in Denmark that break the sternum when they lay eggs, that is to say help within a few years. Then what I want to hear from the Minister is why we are not making national initiatives that can put pressure on the European Union and on chicken farmers. Why do we not update the Animal Protection Act so that it complies with its intention that animals should not suffer in Denmark? Well, it's in the law that animals shouldn't suffer. And it has to be said, to put it mildly, that it is being bypassed in Danish lay production when millions of hens break the sternum when they lay eggs. What can we do in Denmark, Minister, if we are not going to wait for an EU process that we do not really know how to solve the problem?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131314	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131319	I can simply promise Mr. Torsten Gejl, that if we could do anything on the Danish side, we would have done it. I would also like to put an end to this as soon as possible. What is the point is that, roughly speaking, there are two places in Europe where you do the work with these laying hens. It's in Germany, and it's in France. This means that it takes place outside Denmark's borders. If you're gonna have laying hens, you're gonna buy them from there. You can't buy them in Denmark. So if we want egg production in the future and there are good reasons to eat eggs; that's also part of the dietary advice; they're filled with proteins and other things, that's where you have them. That is why we need to change it at EU level. We cannot make a difference in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131357	That is the final question. Here you go, sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131358	The feeling I am left with is that the Minister accepts that the matter is now in the European Union. The minister will of course push, but it takes time to bring about such major changes in breeding programmes. I think that there is a very great deal of concern about this problem in Denmark and it will only be growing in the years to come. If the Minister does not think it would be wise to update animal protection legislation so that it complies with its intention, instead of risking that, for example, there is a risk that we will be able to do so. are there campaigns which simply inform the Danes very widely about this problem and simply call on the Danes to boycott these eggs until the problem is solved?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131433	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131433-2	We are open to all initiatives. It's not like we're left with crossed arms. We work on this all the time. What we've identified is that if we're going to solve this problem, then it's going to happen with the breeders who make the gene material for these laying hens. That is why we need to use the European Union because it is something that is happening in Germany, and it is something that is happening in France. Only yesterday I had a longer meeting with the new Minister for Agriculture from Germany, Cem Özdemir, where we talked about it. We're doing everything we can. We're just keeping in constant contact about this. We also have a meeting with the industry all the time. We want this to be resolved as soon as possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131513	Thank you, sir. Torsten Gejl, thank you to the Minister. The question is over. This means that we have come to questions to the Minister for the Environment by Mr. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131519	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131529	Thank you, President. Does the great local resistance, including from a unanimous council, lead the Minister to reconsider the designation of the Bidstrup Forests as a potential natural park?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131539	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131540	Thank you for the question. This gives us an opportunity to address the point where we left the debate in this Chamber last week. I think it is important to say something about where we really come from. We come from the point of view that Danish nature is in crisis. After many, many years, we need to do something different from what we usually do. That is also what experts recommend. They say that there is simply a need for us to have large self-managing natural areas in Denmark, more untouched forests and natural hydrology, and that we get these big grassers out that can help nature along the way. So that is what the government has concluded an agreement with a number of parties on, namely the agreement on a natural and biodiversity package in Denmark, which must historically lift Danish nature. Therefore, there was a process that started before last summer, where we got input from the whole country, that is, from citizens, associations and municipalities, to where these areas could be. Approx. 200 areas in. They have been narrowed to a gross list of 23 areas. We have then been looking at them, and one of them is the Bidstrup Forests in Lejre Municipality. It is important to say that we have a technical starting point, that is, a gross list of state areas, where we know that we can make a real difference to Denmark's nature. Then we have said on top of that that it is important that we get all the inputs that are also needed before choosing the next up to ten locations of natural parks in Denmark. This applies to input from municipalities to which the questioner asks, but it also applies to input from citizens and organisations, where we decided in December to give ourselves some more time to delve into the material very thoroughly, but also to have follow-up dialogues. This is exactly the dialogue that we are engaged in now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131739	Sir. Morten Dahlin, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131740	Thank you, Minister, for your reply. The Minister himself mentions that the dialogue should not only be with the municipality but also with citizens and associations. Fortunately, we are in the situation where, when it comes to the Bidstrup Forests, citizens and associations have already been involved and made their position very clear. There are a large number of associations and institutions in the local area that have come together and have clearly said: No thanks to the enclosure in the Bidstrup Forests. These are the local post-schools. This is the Forest Users' Council. These are organisations that arrange something for people who care a lot about dogs or horses. It is therefore generally a wide range of people who use the Bidstrup Forests in everyday life, and they have all said: We do not want enclosure in the Bidstrup Forests. The same comes from a city council which has been politically united all around, including the Minister's own party. You have said: we do not want this enclosure. The Minister then mentions that there will be a dialogue. I would therefore like to ask a follow-up question: if, even after that dialogue, it is now clear that the local area does not want to be fenced into the Bidstrup Forests, would the Minister be willing to say that it is not, of course, being pulled over the head of the local area which does not actually want this solution? And if the Minister is not ready for that, what is the point of having a dialogue if you have already decided?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131912	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131913	I am actually pleased that the questioner is also in favour of how we can ensure that the votes of those associations and of those citizens who are active and use the natural area very much are heard in this debate. This is exactly what we wanted to ensure, partly through natural migration and partly through the dialogue that is also with the municipality. I was part of the natural migration that was in the Bidstrup Forests to hear some of the input there is. I myself have also had meetings with many of the open-air organisations, which are relevant to being able to enter the Danish nature and practice their sports and enjoy nature at all. So we have to have that dialogue. What is just missing from the Left is what is the Left's plan.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131956	Then it's mr. Morten Dahlin. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209131957	Thank you to the Minister for his answer, which unfortunately was not an answer to the question. Because what I was asking was that if the dialogue that the Minister is talking about the government having with users, organisations, associations, schools and municipalities results in the message to the minister being the same as it is today, that we do not want the enclosure of the Bidstrup Forests • is the minister so ready to listen to it and say: then we go ahead with the national parks where there is local support for it, and then we find another solution where the local area says clearly no?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132027	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132028	This is something that is really important here, and which has been very close to us all the way through, namely to say that we must ensure a helping hand to Denmark's nature, and we must ensure exciting natural experiences for the Danes. There are a lot of people who love to get out into their local area, and that is why we are concerned about finding good local solutions. So there is both a process of identifying areas, and then there is a process of good local solutions. That's exactly what we're doing. But I also have to say that it is a little remarkable that the Left and now we had four hours of debate last week, when there was a little longer time, has not made a single suggestion as to what needs to be done for Denmark's nature.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132103	Yes, and there is no more time now. But now we have the last question. Here you go, sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132105	Thank you. The Left wants to do something for nature and wants to do something for biodiversity, but it does not necessarily have to be exactly the way the government wants it and without real involvement of the local area. Therefore, I would just like to ask again: if, following the dialogue that the Minister says she wants with citizens and municipalities and associations, the Minister hears that they reach the same result, which says that the local area does not want to be fenced into the Bidstrup Forests, will the Minister be ready to listen and say that the government will then of course drop those plans?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132136	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132137	After all, the whole purpose of having a dialogue is to listen to the views that are coming. Right now, there are these plus 20 areas on state territory where we are in dialogue, among other things. with associations and municipalities etc. But the Left doesn't answer how: We want to help nature, but, but... that's just what we hear over and over again from the Left, and I just have to say that it loses on both nature and all the Danes who love nature, that is, on.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132201	Thank you. The question is over. Thank you, sir. Morten Dahlin, and thank you to the Minister. We go further, and now the question to the Minister for Taxation is asked by Mr. Bertel Haarder, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132210	Here you go for the reading of the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132213	What will the Minister do to free business from the burden of the new Swedish registration requirement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132222	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132224	Thank you for the question. It is my first time as a minister to answer questions here in the Folketing, so I think it is an honour to be allowed to have questions put by the longest-standing member of the Folketing, so thank you for that. Let me start by emphasising that, like my predecessor, I will work towards a solution to the administrative challenges that Swedish registration rules bring to Danish employers with employees living in Sweden who work from home. I share the concerns of the Border Obstacle Council and Danish companies that the new Swedish rules may constitute a barrier to the functioning of the labour market in the Øresund region. My predecessor has written this to the former Swedish Finance Minister on several occasions, not later than 1 November last year. On the Danish side, it has also been stressed several times that a solution to the administrative challenges posed by the new Swedish registration rules for Danish employers should be found quickly. As the questioner knows, this is not a problem that has arisen because of Danish rules. These are internal Swedish rules which only Sweden can change. In addition, there has been a strong desire to link the solution to the problem, which is with the internal Swedish registration rules, together with a renegotiation of the Øresund agreement. It is both a time-consuming and complicated way to go, among other things. because the renegotiation of the Øresund Agreement, including the extension of the domestic employment rule for public employees, may have significant revenue implications for Denmark. We have stressed from the Danish side that it is not necessary to link a renegotiation of the Øresund agreement with a solution to the problems posed by the Swedish registration rules for Danish employers. The problem has arisen as a result of an internal Swedish amendment and can and should be resolved independently of the Øresund Agreement. We have a strong desire for a solution for the Danish employers concerned. That is why we have also indicated on several occasions that we would be happy to contribute to a solution on home working days, which could provide additional security for the Swedish state, if Sweden so needs. Despite this, we have to recognise that there is still some way to go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132415	Sir. Bertel Haarder.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132416	I would like to begin by congratulating the new tax minister on the important and difficult post. And you can see from the wording of the question that it was addressed to the predecessor of the predecessor, with whom I had a dialogue, who has been in consultation in the delegation to the Nordic Council and who has promised to massage his Swedish colleague, and I understand, which is new to me, that in November there was a request from the then tax minister to the Swedish colleague. But now there have been several months, and I would like to stress that what made me deeply impressed was a long letter from both sides of industry. So this is not an employer matter; the employees are also opposed to it. This is, of course, linked to what the next question is about, namely that we must remove barriers to traffic and commuting across the Sound, because this will make both Denmark and Sweden richer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132528	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132528-2	Yes, and allow me to acknowledge, too, sir. Bertel Haarder's efforts to get a stronger integrated Øresund region and to address this issue. And as I said, it is true that my predecessor sent a letter to the then Swedish Finance Minister, now Prime Minister, per. November 1. And I have allowed myself before Question Time here to follow up on how we proceed. And there is dialogue and negotiation. I have, of course, passed on the wish that we should continue with what, in reality, must be our common objective, namely to remove the obstacles to the commuters. And I am fully aware that this is not only an employer problem but also an employee problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132606	Sir. Bertel Haarder.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132607	I would like to thank you for the good will expressed by both answers, but I would like to add a wish that the new minister will contact his new Swedish colleague, which is a new ministerial team, both in Denmark and in Sweden, and that it can lead to a dialogue on something that is important for both Denmark and Sweden. Think of the high level of unemployment on the other side of the Sound, think of our shortage of labour. We need as many employers as possible, as many companies as possible to employ Swedes, both here in the country and in Skåne.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132646	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132647	Thank you. I would like to sign for the question and the request. I also think it is essential to pursue that problem in fact, because I agree with Mr McMahon. Bertel Haarder in that it is quite obvious that at a time when we have such a great shortage of Danish labour, one of the easiest things should be to invite some of the Swedish unemployed to join us on the best way forward is a letter, or at least whether it is to continue the dialogue. I would like to sign for it and also say that I will certainly pay close attention to that dialogue and also to the progress made in it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132719	The last question to Mr. Bertel Haarder. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132721	I think that both this matter and the next one we are going to discuss can justify both a telephone call and a visit to the colleague. And I'm sure I have the Minister of Cooperation behind me when I call for it. He has decided, together with his Swedish colleague, that a joint effort must now be made so that the Øresund can grow together again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132748	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132748-2	I took office last Friday, so I have simply not met any of my colleagues around, but I assume that in the foreseeable future I will also have a meeting with my Swedish colleague, and I would now like to say that this will be one of the points I want to raise with my Swedish colleague.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132805	Thank you. The question is over. But we will continue with the tax minister and Mr. Bertel Haarder who asks.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132811	Please read the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132814	In view of the decline in commuters despite high unemployment on the Swedish side of the Sound, what will the Minister do to remove border barriers in the Øresund region, among others? in the area of taxation, to attract more Swedish commuters?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132830	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209132831	Thank you for the question. Let me start by pointing out, as the questioner knows and has had a share in the fact that Denmark and Sweden, with the conclusion of the Øresund agreement almost 20 years ago, have removed the main fiscal barriers to the integration of the labour market in the Øresund region. Simply put, the Øresund agreement ensures that private commuters are taxed exclusively in the country of work if more work is carried out at work than at home in the country of residence, and if, for example, they do not work in the country of residence. a person who lives in Denmark and is employed in Sweden, works most of the time in Denmark, the clear starting point should be that tax should be paid in Denmark in the same way as other people who live and work here. The Øresund Agreement may, as it stands, contain a significant change in working patterns. Therefore, although developments had to move towards increased homework in certain sectors, I do not think there is any need to make a general amendment to the agreement. Having said that, it is of course still possible to consider changes. Among other things: several Øresund commuters during the period of the Coronapandemi have had to work so much from home that they have been taxed by home working days in the country of residence rather than in the normal working country. It is understandable that this situation can lead to uncertainty and inconvenience for commuters. In the context of the renegotiation of the Øresund Agreement, the possibility of further flexibility in homework in similar future pandemic situations should therefore be considered. Another proposal that has previously been made is to extend the special rules for homework for private employees in the Øresund Agreement to include public employees. As a starting point, I think that there is a fair balance in the current rules, on the one hand, with regard to the wish of the country of payment to be able to tax wage income paid from public funds and, on the other hand, with regard to the wish of the country of residence to be able to tax work done in that country by people living there. Nor can the proposal be viewed in isolation from the revenue exchange mechanism of the Øresund Agreement. If public employees are also included in the revenue exchange scheme, the annual net transfer from Denmark to Sweden will be increased by a three-digit million amount, and this will of course also help to complicate future discussions with Sweden on various elements of the Øresund agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133041	Bertel Haarder, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133043	Thank you for a thorough answer, which I look forward to reading in all the details, and I look forward to discussing it with the Secretariat of the Border Prevention Council. The whole thing was updated during the Corona crisis, which, moreover, is not yet over, where countless employees were asked to work at home, and for some it has become addictive so that they still work at home sometimes and where, just because they work at home, they are taxed in a different way than if they work at the company. I think everyone can tell themselves that this is an Old Norse principle which does not stand in the long run because homework has become part of working life in the Nordic countries. And then there is no point in having very different rules which make you penalised if you work at home, getting a bureaucratic hell if you work at home, taxing in two countries, etc., and I would like to highlight the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Affairs. Because I raised a completely similar question with her, and she decided in 14 days that those working at home are treated in terms of social, social and social matters, just as if they were working outside. Could it not be the starting point for a discussion with the Swedish colleague to have an amendment to the Øresund agreement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133232	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133233	I simply do not wish to reject that. Well, I think it makes sense to bring it too. Now, of course, I have said that this will be a theme for my first meeting with my Swedish colleague when that time comes, and I would very much like to look into it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133246	Sir. Bertel Haarder.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133247	I am glad that the Minister is not rejecting anything. And I'm not trying to score political points on it; I'm only trying to solve a problem that a lot of people are waiting for us to solve. Just think, we had 17,000 commuters who came every day to Denmark before the corona crisis. 90% of them were Swedes who worked in Denmark. It's just the ones we need. Now you'd think they'd come back, but they haven't, only to a lesser extent. That's why it's so serious.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133329	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133330	My impression and now I say the impression, because I have not seen evidence to support it is that many of the Swedes who work in Denmark have been in the catering industry, in our shops, etc., and that means that it will typically be people who have limited homework. On the other hand, I think I agree with the questioner that these agreements are probably made at a time when homework filled a smaller part of working life. Therefore, I am certainly not opposed to looking at whether it could not be relevant if the time comes for renegotiating the Øresund agreement to look at what the relationship is like there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133408	Bertel Haarder, final question, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133410	It is true that many of the jobs carried out by Swedish employees on the Danish side of the Sound, especially in Copenhagen and the Copenhagen area, are often service jobs where you can start and finish in a very short time. But if there is something we lack in Denmark, then it is precisely people, Swedes, who want to man exactly such jobs. Look at how the catering industry fights to get to those who have previously tested us in the test centres. They're short-staffed. The employees are on the other side of the Sound there are 10%. unemployment. Let's do something.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133459	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133500	Agreed. It is quite obvious, when we are in need of labour in Denmark, that we then make an extra effort to also find out how we can remove the obstacles that make the Swedish, who wants to work in Denmark, also have easy and unbureaucratic access to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133516	Thank you, Minister. Thanks to Bertel Haarder. That concludes Question Time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220209133524	There is no more to be done in this sitting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Thursday, 10 February, at 10 a.m. 10:00. I refer to the agenda set out in the Danish Parliament's website.
