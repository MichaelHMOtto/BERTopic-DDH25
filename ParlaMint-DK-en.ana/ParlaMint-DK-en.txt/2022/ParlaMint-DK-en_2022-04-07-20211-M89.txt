ParlaMint-DK_20220407102432	The debate is open. Sir. Jens Joel, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407102501	Thank you for that, President. Today, after all, we are discussing an important draft law: a bill on high schools and youth education throughout the country, including in the thinner populated areas. It's a bill that's about us having mixed high schools. It is a bill that has been demanded by the associations of the high schools, by pupils' organisations, by a great many local politicians, and it is a bill that really has to deal with some of the trends we have seen, for polarisation, for fragmentation, for the division of our country and for our youth education. It is a problem which is widely recognized in the Folketing. It was the then Minister of Education from the Left, Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby, who said in 2016 that what was called ghetto high school should now be done. And before the next school year, one had to understand, the Left Government wanted to have solved the problem. It was then not solved in 2017, but fortunately there is now a political majority who has made an agreement that means that we get high schools in better balance, with better student distribution, with the focus on being able to choose high schools all over the city or in the whole area you live in. In other words, there must be more focus on the fact that you can go further away and not only can choose and be sure to have a place at the higher school that is closer to you, and that there must also be high schools in those places in the country where there are falling adolescences, where there are relatively few young people, and where it can therefore have major consequences if someone from a youth year leaves it. So I am glad that in a broad majority from the Danish People's Party across the government and the middle of the Enhedslisten on the other side we have in fact come together to say that it is a quality of the Danish school system that one can of course wish where one would like to go to school, but it is also a quality that one ensures that we meet across different religious, ethnic, social backgrounds, and therefore we have made a proposal for the distribution of pupils or for what we call the coordinated registration. That's because the distribution thing sounds like it's something completely decoupled from what you want. And the truth is today that there is no free choice there is not free admission. I didn't get the high school I applied for, but I got a good high school after all. What is the problem right now is that there are too many places where you have high schools that are totally out of balance, while at the same time you do not actually have a system where there is free choice and where the popular high schools are filled and where you only have a chance to get in if you live close to them. These are some of the things we must have done up to, other than ensuring that there is a high school where you live in a place that you are close to so that we do not get the depopulated and do not get a situation where the young people who live in the thinner populated areas of our country do not have the possibility of a youth education. We support the proposal, of course, and I will look forward to the debate on this. I'm sure of it and I can see in the Chamber that there are a lot of people who would like to ask questions about this, so I'll look forward to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407102845	That is quite correct. First, it's sir. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407102849	Let me introduce the rapporteur to Marcus. Marcus is 14 years old and goes to Strandskolen in Greve Municipality. When Marcus finishes primary school, he wants to go to the local Count Gymnasium. It is a high school with a broad student distribution of people with a Danish background, of people with a non-Western background, of people who have parents who earn a lot of money, and of people who have parents who do not earn so much money. It's a good mixed high school. Marcus is not a rich man's son. He's not a snob. Marcus doesn't mind going with directors' daughters and mechanics' sons. But with the bill that the government has put forward here today, Marcus' chance of entering the local high school falls dramatically. Hans free choice of school is severely curtailed, not based on anything Marcus himself has done, but based solely on how much Marcus' parents earn. I would therefore like to ask: why does the rapporteur think that social democracy is better at choosing school for Marcus than Marcus himself?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407102954	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407102955	Well, no one's better at choosing school for anyone. Well, Marcus might want to go to Rysensteen High School, which is half an hour away and is in the centre. You can now. In the model proposed by the Committee of Experts, among other things: One of the proposals made by the then Left Government was to make district gymnasiums, so one was sure that one came to the nearest high school, but one was also sure that one had no choice at all. These are the discussions we have. If the Left does not believe that we should actually have free admission, then the Left cannot, of course, indicate a model where there is free choice; unless what one would prefer to do is to go to the high school which, incidentally, one should be lucky enough to live right next door, so that one can be sure that one is at the front of the queue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103043	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103044	The rapporteur throws himself into some theoretical considerations and some attacks on the Left, but does not answer the question as such. With the bill that the rapporteur is standing here defending and calling an important and good bill, Marcus' free elections are being cut. Marcus is not a fictional person; Marcus does not want to go to Rysensteen Gymnasium; Marcus is a real person who wants to go to his local high school, which is a mixed high school. Why is it that the Social Democratic Party believes that Marcus' free elections should be cut as strongly as is proposed with this bill?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103117	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103118	Well, if Marcus chooses his high school, there will still be the greatest probability that that is actually what he gets. Marcus is not a fictional person, no, but that scenario, sir. Morten Dahlin is actually a fictional scenario where they say: Marcus will no longer be able to go to high school. There is no indication that he will not be able to do so. What is our point is that not everyone feels like Marcus, and that's actually okay. That is actually why we have chosen to create a model which does not create districts and which does not provide for going to the nearest high school, but which gives young people a free choice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103153	Thank you. Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103155	Thank you so much. What we are dealing with today is coercion... it's forced division. How does the rapporteur actually feel about leaving the bill for decades of misguided immigration policy, such as this bill? The rapporteur's own party was at the forefront, directly in the teenage room? How does the rapporteur actually feel about this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103223	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103224	I strongly disagree that there is a bill for something. On the other hand, I agree that we have integration problems, that we have high schools, which are all too distorted today. We have seen that there have been trends too self-enhancing trends so that when some colleges got a too high share of a student group with a certain background, it became self-enhancing; then more came with the same background, and then there were others with a different background that searched away from there, and then we get a polarization that becomes self-enhancing. I understand that New Citizens' policy is really that these people should not exist, but they do exist, they live here after all, that is part of our reality. That is why, in fact, I think what is important is to ensure that we make integration work, that we actually meet across, that we actually avoid the parallel trends in society and the divisions, divisions and ethnically dominated colleges, which we have unfortunately seen in some places in the larger cities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103323	Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103324	Yes, we want foreign policy solved from the bottom up. We need to clean up the mess that, among other things. The rapporteur's party has helped create in Denmark. But, frankly, what does the rapporteur really think? You leave the bill in the teenage room.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103344	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103345	It may be because I am not taking part in the foreign policy debates, but I still haven't understood what the solution means from the bottom up. In fact, I think that we are now discussing how to avoid high schools being polarised, how to avoid the self-enhancing effect we have seen, how to avoid that some of those who live close to a high school have no interest in going to that high school, because the composition of pupils has become of a kind that you cannot see yourself in, because the youth culture has become a different one, and that is why you are looking away. There is therefore an unfortunate tendency in this respect, which the rapporteur will not deal with at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103420	Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103422	Thank you. The government spends 197.5 million. kr. to redistribute students over the next 5 years. How can the Social Democratic Party help to spend so much money on the forced distribution of students? Wouldn't this money have been better spent raising the level?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103445	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103449	I can say first of all that when you put it that way, it sounds as if you have to pay a bill from a trucker who drives out and picks up the young people and moves them somewhere else. No, what we spend the money on is investing in a high school sector in better balance, by the way, also a high school sector that is in a better geographical balance, so that we also have high schools in the thinner populated areas. And yes, it is an important investment in our youth education. In contrast to the party represented by Mrs Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel, we have, in fact, also made up for the cuts that have been made year after year in upper secondary education. And last year we raised the contribution so that we filled the gap after the savings led by the Conservative People's Party and the Left. And yes, quality has been damaged, and yes, there is a great task to be done. But that does not exclude us from fulfilling the task that the previous government also identified, but which it did nothing to solve.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103545	Mrs Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103546	Now I'm talking to a lot of parents, students, young people and children in the county of Greve, who are really worried about their future now with this bill that the government is making. I would really like to hear the rapporteur: what will the rapporteur say to those citizens, parents, children and young people who are now very concerned about their future?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103607	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103608	Well, I also talk to children and young people, and by the way, I have been talking to parents and young people for several years, and this often leads to discussions. In Aarhus the discussions have been about the fact that there were some high schools you didn't want to go to because they had come out of balance. In Count, maybe you ask, "Well, there's gonna be a less chance that I'm gonna go here?" And there you have to have a dialogue about what's on the S-train line of other high schools nearby. I drove myself across Odense to go to my high school; it didn't ruin my high school. But, of course, there is a discussion to be held, and we must take it honestly with people in order to reassure them about what is going on here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103645	Thank you. Heidi Bank, Left, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103647	Thank you. It is a good thing that the rapporteur himself has not seen it as a problem to have transport time, but what is being proposed here is a very long journey time which some pupils can get. The government apparently sees parents with low incomes as poor parents and parents with high incomes as good parents. So does the rapporteur not see that there is a problem here in relation to young people having less time for all the fun, for study work, to get involved in associations because they are being given extra transport time?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103724	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103725	First of all, it will still be the case that the vast majority of students do not have long transport time. In other words, if you ask in the country, I think you will hear that 20 minutes or 25 minutes is not long transport time, but it may well be that the Left has a different view of it. It's one discussion. Then there is the discussion about whether some parents are better. It is notoriously wrong to say that this is the view of the Social Democratic Party. What we're saying is that whatever a wallet you have in your back pocket, it's a quality that you meet across the different backgrounds, because you can learn from and about each other. Going to high school is, of course, about getting dressed on a professional basis, but it is also about becoming part of a community, being trained for the society that you have to go out and be part of, and it is now one of different people, and it is actually very good to meet them. I also believe that most people will remember schoolmates who have ended up somewhere else in life than they are, with an understanding of what they have been through.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103824	Heidi Bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103825	But that is a completely misleading picture when it comes to saying that we do not meet across as it is today. We do that in primary school, we do that through our upbringing, and we do that in associations. So when the rapporteur comes up with that picture that you make a society that doesn't work, if you don't mix pupils or force some of them somewhere else than near where they live, then it's just nonsense. However, I would like to repeat my question: does the rapporteur not see that there is a problem here in relation to the fact that some pupils are going to have a very long journey time?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103859	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103900	Mrs. Heidi Bank is elected in Aarhus, just like you. If you say that there is no fragmentation, that we meet across and that there are no challenges, I would like to ask: has Mrs Heidi Bank discussed with anyone what the problems have been at Langkaer Gymnasium? Has Mrs. Heidi Bank been discussing with people at Viby High School who were afraid their high school was gonna tip? These are good high schools which have for many years offered their young people a really, really good youth education, and I think they should be able to continue to do so. But they have been trapped in a negative spiral that we would like to help them out of.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103938	Mrs Mette Abildgaard, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407103940	For the Social Democratic Party, it is obviously important to balance a sector. The rapporteur has said this several times from the platform. And there you choose to think of young people as small pieces or figures in an excelark that you can move around until you have achieved the systemic balance that you now think is appropriate with your ideological spectacles. But the reality is that it's real young people you move around like they were pieces or numbers in an excelark. I would like to hear the rapporteur's views on the debate that a number of researchers had in Politiken, where they wrote the following: there is a risk that more young people will be socially injured, feeling more lonely, losing their foothold with apostasy as a consequence. That was among other things. Professor Niels Egelund and others, who wrote it in Politiken on 24 March 2022. Is it more important for social democracy that the system is in balance than that individual young people are allowed to have a free choice?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104033	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104034	Of course, it is important for young people to be well off in high school. And I also read that speech in Politiken. There was also an answer from a high school, which this is about, which says: We cannot look at our young people, that they are thriving worse, even though it was not their first choice they have got a good place; we have less apostasy than some of the popular high schools. So there is not the context that Mrs Mette Abildgaard would say. But no, I actually think the whole thing is important. That's right. That is also what the student and student movement has been fighting for. When the high school students have said that they want high schools in a better balance, that is because the young people actually also see the point that you cannot end up in a high school that is completely crooked, and therefore they have an interest in the quality and ability to actually get proper education being good at all high schools so that no one pulls the buck and the others turn their backs. And the rapporteur refuses to discuss this problem because there is no freedom of movement and therefore no complete freedom of choice, even in the desires of the Conservatives.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104139	Mette Abildgaard, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104140	The answer given by the rapporteur emphasizes precisely the position that the system knows best. It may well be that the young people go somewhere else than they wanted, but it turned out to be a very good decision for them. The system knows best. Can the rapporteur then answer me as to why it has been decided to set a ceiling on the capacity of private colleges? After all, it is the wildest confession case that we know that there will be young people who will go there because the system wants to force them somewhere else. Why has it been decided to set a ceiling on the capacity of private high schools if it is not precisely to limit the free choice of young people?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104212	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104213	In other words, the confession is that we actually have a collective interest, and that is the one that not I, but also the students themselves, have argued that the colleges are in balance. And no, I don't see it as an assault that we have mixed high schools. On the contrary, I think that the problem that the Left and the Conservatives and other parties are not going to solve now, with the very polarized, crooked high schools, is that there are some young people who say: yes, it was so unfortunate for you that you did not succeed in doing so and the fact that the private colleges have been excluded is because we agreed that they should be unaffected by this agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104251	Thank you. Then it's Katarina Ammitzbøll, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104253	Thank you. I was about to fall out of the chair, as the Minister was about to call us in for a long time and said that if we could make this deal with the Radicals, we could give each other a hand, and then you didn't care about the settlement. The Conservatives eventually left this debate, and we did, because this is coercion. We can look at recent studies showing how very special young girls are miserable, and we can take Caroline, who now lives right over here, in Copenhagen. She has a number of high schools around where there is virtually the same income. She doesn't thrive very well, but now she's taking the step to high school, where she wants to go with her girlfriends. But she doesn't get her wish, and now she has to be sent far away, at least an hour, and it may be that she goes to Count. What do you think Carolines's well-being will be like? Does it get better or worse, and what is her chance to move high school because of distraction?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104401	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104403	To the end first, that is, the fact that you can move high schools if you do not thrive: there can be professional or social reasons why you have to change high schools, and that is unaffected, and you can still do that, even in another situation. But I am not sure what it is, Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll believes there should be the criterion. Are those grades? Now you said it was someone who was under pressure. So, are these the grades you have to go for when you distribute the students, or is that a free admission that the Conservatives are in favour of? I would also like to point out that there is a danger that some negotiations will be referred to. I think it is a little out of the question to do so in the Chamber, and I cannot confirm or deny what has been said.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104450	Katarina Ammitzbøll, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104451	Now I asked if you could move high school because of dissatisfaction, because you have come to a high school that you have not wanted, and we have asked questions about it in the past, and what I recall from that answer, but now I haven't been in the last part of the negotiations, is that you couldn't. It's up to the principal, but as long as there's no incentive to pass on students, even if you lose a meter, the probability was pretty small. So I broadly respond to what I really would have liked the rapporteur to reply to. The second question I have was: why not just move the distance criteria and look at mobility...
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104527	Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll, we have to keep to the speaking time. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104536	But here Mrs Katarina Ammitzbøll knows something of the essence. For some of what we are doing with this agreement is, of course, reducing the competition that has existed between high schools. And to be honest, there has been too little focus on what benefited the students and too much focus on how to fill up your classes in the transition between high schools. That is why it would be good if we went somewhere where what actually decided whether we could change high school was not the economic incentive of the high school, but rather the well-being of the young person professionally or socially as it is about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104609	Mrs Britt Bager, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104611	Thank you. I was somewhat surprised by the rapporteur's speech. For the rapporteur says in his speech: it is a quality that you can, of course, go to a school where you want. Will the rapporteur confirm to me whether more or less pupils will be able to meet their wishes with this agreement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104642	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104643	What I should perhaps have said is that I actually think it is a quality that the desire that one has is part of where one goes to school, and that is how it is today. There is not a free choice, so not everyone gets their first priority, nor will it be forward-looking. And yes, the calculations underlying this show that there will be a slight drop in the number that will be given their first priority. On the other hand, with this model, there is a guarantee that you get one of those you have chosen, where in the current system, where there are a lot of people who choose a first choice and perhaps a second choice, you risk, if it is not possible, ending up in a high school that you never imagined. So, yes, that is partly true, but it is also in a situation where there is not a completely free choice today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104732	Mrs. Britt Bager.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104733	That's partly true? Then I simply have to call on the rapporteur to read the paper that was sent out in connection with this bill yesterday. Because that's not partly true. It's totally whistle-blowing wrong. There will be fewer students who will have their wish fulfilled. There is a clear table of figures on how the redistribution is from the government, and I can say to the rapporteur that this in the municipality of Lyngby-Taarbæk will mean that only 87 per cent. get their wish fulfilled, and in Gentofte it is only 86%.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104807	Thank you. Then we'll get an answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104814	But it was not actually an attempt to say the opposite of it. Because I said, yes, the percentage then falls to 87 compared to the first priority. What is then the opposing trend is that when you choose the four that you have to in this model, you actually get one of those that you have pointed out. In the current system, if you don't get your first priority and haven't written anything else on, you don't know where you're going. Right now, we often see that there is a relatively high response to first priorities and that there is also a rather large strategic search because you are looking for what you think you have a good chance of getting into because it is close. On the other hand, a large number of those who do not receive the top priority will be given the fifth priority.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104848	Then it's mr. Kim Valentin, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104853	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur. In the Left, it is extremely important that we ensure that the individual is free to choose. This is the basis of everything we work for free elections in everyday life. For young people, it is extremely important that free choice is part of their daily lives. They have, for example, a long period of time. under compulsion, even in relation to going home during covid-19. We've seen the thriving fall. The trivslen is also super important for the Left. Does the rapporteur agree that well-being and free choice are conducive to young people's choice of study and to staying in a study? Can we agree on this and can the rapporteur confirm that well-being is important?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104955	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407104957	Trivsel is by its very nature extremely important. Free choice is also important. That is why free choice is also part of the new model. But I can of course ask the rapporteur of the Left, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Kim Valentin, whether the Left wants free admission, or whether you can confirm that there is no freedom of choice today either. There is concern for what you want. There will also be in the future model. But there is no free choice if there is a search for a popular high school that you would like.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105030	Sir. Kim Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105032	If I listen correctly to the rapporteur, then the rapporteur says that this is a less free choice than it was in the past. And that's why the thriving must fall in some way as well. But let me ask you a positive question instead. Let me ask: okay, let's assume that the thriving gets a little smaller and that's what you're sacrificing with this bill. What will the government do, then, what will the Social Democrats do to increase the prosperity of taking a little away from here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105101	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105103	But I do not accept the premise. It is true that it is a different free choice because the distribution will be different, but we have actually chosen to insist that you should not have either clusters or district models. It is because it must be the case that you can choose, even if you live at Amager, to go to a high school in Copenhagen. It still has to be an opportunity. In fact, you can also move out of the zones. You can choose all over Zealand if that's what you want.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105135	Then it's mr. Rasmus Stoklund, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105138	It is perhaps not surprising, not a critical question that I am going to put to the rapporteur, but more of a kind of service information, and this is because, if you have followed the debate from the outside, you might get the impression that Mr. Jens Joel was trying to make life miserable for young people in Count. Now I have tried to look up what the distance is from Strandskolen to Greve Gymnasium and Solrød Gymnasium respectively, and it is to both high schools approx. Five kilometers. I regard it as a service information and an attempt to contribute some proportions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105207	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105213	We can then say that this is an indication in the debate here. It is true that the discussion about Count fills a great deal. Perhaps that is because the rapporteur on the left is from the area. I do not know if that is the background.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105230	Anne Honoré Østergaard, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105233	Now I have been sitting here listening to this rather long debate and I have to admit that I have been slightly confused by the rapporteur's many answers. At one point, however, I found that the rapporteur said that there was too little focus on what benefits students. I agree with that. However, that still leads me to ask a question, because I have been confused and perhaps the rapporteur can help me. What, according to the rapporteur, is the primary purpose of youth education? Is it to train young people for further education and jobs? Or is it imposing a primary responsibility on young people to resolve a failed integration effort?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105325	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105326	Okay, I think it is difficult to disagree that youth education should first and foremost put young people on for the further training course or if youth education is a vocational training for the working life that follows. It just can't be discussed. If we then also discuss the fact that you learn other things in high school than reading and counting, it is because you also become part of a community that goes beyond school and that you will probably also be able to learn something from meeting each other across different backgrounds. However, Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard pretends that the task of correcting the imbalance does not exist, and I would just remind you that it was the Secretary of Education of the Left who said in 2016: The problem of ghetto schools and skewed high schools must be resolved next school year. It is still gone quite many years ago that it was promised. So you don't recognise that the problem exists or what?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105426	Mrs. Anne Honoré Østergaard, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105428	I have just been a little confused by everything the rapporteur says. I also understand that the rapporteur says that there are some young people who now get 20-25 minutes to their place of education. That's the risk. We're talking about plus one hour. Is the rapporteur not at all worried that this proposal means that more people are falling out and more people are going to be disillusioned? I'm a personal person.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105457	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105459	It's true that it can be up to an hour. What I said in 20 minutes is that it's still far away most people go to school in a much shorter time than an hour. I believe that today there will also be many who spend 20-25 minutes in school. In the thinner populated areas there is usually longer to go to school. I think that what is with the big cities is that you have a feeling that things are so close that you can like expand your horizons by saying that you could also go to one of the other high schools if there is a high school that has music or has a special focus on acting or something. And we must hold on to the free choice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105536	Then it is Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105538	Thank you. I would like to hear the rapporteur on these percentages. I have been informed that the first priority for the future will be 84 per cent. against today 90%, and that is a 16 percentage points drop in the achievement of the first priority. The rapporteur can then confirm that 16% is expected. Are fewer people going to have their first priority met?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105604	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105606	I do not think so, and I do not think Mrs Gitte Willumsen, who is a trained schoolteacher, will do so when she checks it out. For from 90 to 84 per cent. I guess there's only 6 and not 16 percent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105616	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105618	Fair enough, I just took the 10%. extra. Then the numbers look a little nicer. But what you have done with this proposal is, of course, to ask the young people to make more wishes. Now they don't have to make two wishes, now they have to make four wishes, and because you have made the list any longer, you can always come and say: Well you got your wish fulfilled. I have also been involved in this in my primary school to get things going when electives were to be done, and then we asked the young people to choose some more. It's the same exercise you do here, you just ask them to choose more, because then you can say, you got your wish fulfilled. Does the rapporteur not agree with that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105655	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105656	I would like to say two things, or at least two. It is the case today that if you do not live close to Rysensteen Gymnasium, for example, there will be a lot of people who do not put it as their first priority, even though this is perhaps their first priority, because they know that there are many who want to be there, and therefore they do not expect them to be able to do so, and if you do not get your first priority in the current system, you will be put in the back of the queue, which means that you will probably not get your second priority either. That is why it is both right and wrong. In fact, when we say that four high schools must be pointed out, it is in order to be able to take account of the wishes of young people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105732	Sir. Stén Knuth, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105733	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur. More must be transported. There are more who do not get their first choice, and therefore more must also be transported. It's gonna hurt the thriving. What is the rapporteur's and the Social Democrats' view that more people have to be transported and that they have to suffer?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105754	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105755	I am sure that if you are at a high school that is socially and professionally not working and out of balance, you will suffer. I'm not sure it's transport time. However, I agree that there is a part of the thrift which is about the fact that it is good if you have the opportunity to influence your high school choice. That is why, in the model we are proposing, there is also a desire to meet it. And speaking of Mrs. Gitte Willumsens's statistics before, 84% will. Still be the ones who get their first priority. So I actually don't think you can say there's that one-to-one thing. On the other hand, I believe that there is a fairly clear correlation with the well-being if a high school has come out of balance socially and professionally and in other ways, because then there is a greater risk of young people falling away.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105846	Sir. Stén Knuth, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105848	Thank you, President. Does the rapporteur not recognise the analysis made by the Ministry of Children and Education, which points out that the longer the distance to a place of education, a high school, the greater the risk that pupils will drop out? Does the rapporteur not recognise that analysis?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105906	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105907	Yeah, but there's like two discussions in this. Because it is clear that if you have to travel a long way to go to school, the risk that you can't stand it, that you can't make everyday life hang together and that you fall away will be greater. But what we are discussing today is not really that issue. In fact, right now, with the agreement today and the bill we are discussing, we are actually fulfilling a desire to maintain high schools close to young people in the thinner populated areas in order to avoid those very long transport times. What we are discussing today is that you move around along the S-train lines and internally in the larger cities, where everything else just means a little less with the physical distance, because you are well connected.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105943	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407105945	If you have a high school where there are more applicants than there are seats, then the long-term solution is to expand the colleges. Well, why not? Then you can close places where there aren't enough people looking. But the short-term solution is, of course, that you have to reject those who are looking for that high school. But Mr. Jens Joel not that there is a difference between rejecting some because they live farther away from high school than some others, and then busting students around to all sorts of high schools, based on what their parents earn? So one is a practical solution; the other, which is what is going on here, is pure ideology.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110032	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110033	Well, of course there's a difference between the two models... not in what Mr. Ole Birk Olesen correctly says that when there is a capacity, you have to find out what you are doing with the overapplication. And there we have done so now that it is not the distance but the consideration of the mixed composition of pupils that determines it. I'm sorry, I actually lost track of what sir. Ole Birk Olesen said. I'm sorry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110110	Then we'll just give it to Mr. Kim. Ole Birk Olesen the word again. Here you go, sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110112	Well, I actually think I'd just like to have mr. Jens Joel to say what is right, namely that the bill we are debating today, which is about pupils being distributed around high schools based on their parents' income, is a very, very ideological social democratic bill. So it is not the pragmatic social democracy that is going on here; it is the social democracy that has brought its Minister of Education to the Enhedslisten, who is implementing the ideology of the hard school from the red side of the Danish Parliament.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110152	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110153	Okay, I guess it was very good that I didn't know that was where we were going. I think, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen will be a little upset if that's how this deal is interpreted. I'd like to say to Mr. Mr Ole Birk Olesen, that what is the hops is that the current distance criterion is what is in force today, and that is what has created the polarization problems and, incidentally, the ghetto schools, and what else has been called, as I think Mr. Ole Birk Olesen also thinks is a problem to be dealt with. After all, this is not the case with the present system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110226	Thank you. Then there is simply no more who have asked for brief comments. We would like to thank the rapporteur and move on to Mr Beazley's report. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110242	Thank you for the floor, President. We have a principle here in Denmark when it comes to education, a principle that has been widely agreed politically for years: It is not your parents' purse that will decide which education you will receive. It's a healthy principle. It has served Denmark well and has helped create a country where it is not your economic background that decides which school to go to. Equal access to education means that children's opportunities in life do not depend on their parents' finances. This is what the Social Democrats' website says in black and white. And if you read that sentence, you might wonder why it is a social democratic government that has tabled this bill. I really do not think that most people are aware of the system that a majority of Parliament wants to introduce from next summer. So let me explain so that everyone can understand; let me cut through spins, technical explanations and punks about directors and mechanics. If this bill is passed, a system will have been created from next summer, in which thousands of future high school students will have their free choice cut very sharply even. Instead, it will be the size of their parents' paychecks that determine where they can go to school. Yeah, it's true. This law will result in a large bureaucratic system in which the students are divided into certain categories, based on what their parents earn, and then they will be forced into certain secondary schools in the so-called distribution zones. If it weren't because it was so gravely serious, you'd almost think it was a joke. Think of the students who are being told that they cannot now enter their local high school because their parents earn the wrong amount. Think of Sofie who can't go to school with her friends because her mother makes too little money. Think of Lukas, who lives 500 metres from his local high school, but who is forced to transport himself up to several other high schools to get to the school where the government is not only wrong in principle it is also going to have some low-practical negative consequences. Longer travel time will mean fewer leisure activities and greater apostasy for young people, and this at a time when we are trying to get more people to exercise and sport. Less free choice is going to mean less well-being for young people and this in a period where more and more people are struggling with just increasing dissatisfaction. And the removal from the safe local environment will mean a greater apostasy among the very young people we have been fighting for so long to maintain in our youth education programmes. All because the government has insisted on making a solution that is not targeted in those places with problems, but instead has been hard to conduct a kind of old-fashioned class struggle that does not solve our ghetto challenges. It's the wrong way to go. And this unfortunately reveals a view of youth, which is very, very distant from the Left. We don't see youth as pawns that you can move around on. We do not see young people as the property of the state, which must be part of the realization of the social democratic dream society, and certainly not this generation of young people. We have a historically responsible youth. They drink less than previous generations; they fight less. On the other hand, they vote more and they are better educated. During the corona crisis, young people took a huge responsibility, and yet the government repeatedly encounters them with bans, with coercion, with mistrust. I think it is a very unfortunate signal to send to the Danish youth very unfortunately. In the Left, we believe that it is the young people themselves that are not the prime minister, not the government that is best at choosing where to go to school. We would therefore like to urge the parties to the agreement to reconsider this system. It's unfree, it's unanswered, it's unthinkable. The Left cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110722	Thank you. There are brief comments. First, it's sir. Jens Joel, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110725	Thank you. And thank you, sir. Morten Dahlin for the speech. There are many things that can be tackled, but if we are now to try to focus on the challenge that the Left's own Minister of Education addressed, namely what was called in September 2016 that Ellen Trane will end with ghetto high school before the next school year..., what is the Left's solution that Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby and the Left have been putting with since 2016?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110752	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110753	Well, there are plenty of things you could do if you actually wanted to solve the ghetto problems and did not engage in socialist class struggles for redistribution. First of all, you could have chosen to combine this student distribution agreement with a taximeter reform, for then you could have given some of the high schools some muscle to make yourself more attractive. Secondly, there are actually elements that we support, for example. The fact that you can stop admission to certain schools; that is what we think is a good tool. Thirdly, capacity-setting could have become a more political issue, but the government has refused to do so, but if you did, you could of course expand some of the popular high schools and thereby ensure a wider distribution of pupils while maintaining free choice, but the latter did not, unfortunately, refuse to do so, because this was not about solving the ghetto challenge in Denmark. This was about realising the social democratic dream society and making social engineering where the young people are just pieces that you can move around on a playing board. I think it's too bad.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110850	Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110852	Well, it's totally bizarre to hear that the young people are playing board and pieces in a situation where 84 per cent. In addition, young people are expected to have their first priority in a country where they can choose the education they want after primary school. Sir. Morten Dahlin is a bit weaselful in his answer about what one could actually have done, but is it to hear that one could have closed some high schools and then forced some of the students in the closed high schools at some of the other high schools? Was that the Left's solution to the proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110926	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407110927	But social democracy treats youth as pawns on a board game, where you are moved around, not according to what you have done yourself, but based solely on what your parents earn. Well, we have a principle that it shouldn't be your parents' payroll that decides where to go to school, and that's unfortunately the system you implement with this. I wasn't weaning at all. I gave three very concrete answers to how the Left thinks it should be resolved here, but we do have a fundamental political and ideological disagreement here. We are in favour of the free choice of school, we believe in the individual, including young people. Social democracy wants another way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111000	Katarina Ammitzbøll, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111002	Thanks for a good speech. I think that the rapporteur is quite clearly speaking about what this is all about. I'd like to start with Count Gymnasium. There's a headmaster there who's been turning things around in high school. There is a broad composition of pupils, both economically and ethnically, if one can mention it here. It's kind of worked out in Count. What do you think, sir? Morten Dahlin is the consequences for Count Gymnasium in relation to this proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111033	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111035	Thank you for the question. I think you'll be sorry to hear that you've turned things around in high school, because it's never been bad. You've made sure you didn't end up in a negative spiral. And you actually have at Greve Gymnasium a percentage of non-western immigrants, which is 20, despite the fact that in the municipality it is only 13%. This has been done by having visible management, by having skilled employees and by having a clear strategy, for example. That we do not accept that Arabic is spoken out in the crooks. What will be the consequence for Count Gymnasium is that you risk the great work that has been done falling on the floor. You risk developing in a way that leads to a negative spiral. And the possibility that the hundreds of students from Greve who want to go to their local high school can actually do so is now being pruned, and the students now have to be transported for as much as an hour to other high schools, which are far away and which they do not want to go on. I think that is an unfortunate development.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111122	Katarina Ammitzbøll, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111123	That sounds like a very worrying development, but it can be said that if 20%. of the students who go there have a different ethnic background, which is a higher percentage than the local one, so maybe it is a success, compared to the fact that integration in Count has actually succeeded. There's also this zone thing. I understand there have been questions about it in relation to the Count Zone. And then there's Roskilde and Køge who aren't in this. What are the implications now? Where are the students likely to go?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111154	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111156	Thank you very much for that question. I share one hundred percent of the questioner's analysis of Count Gymnasium as a success story, which is now in danger of being thrown on the floor. It was also asked about Solrød Gymnasium, which then lies outside the distribution zone in which Count Gymnasium is located. I do not think the questioner who asked the question was aware of that, but it is then outside the distribution zone. So you can apply to Solrød Gymnasium, but we all know what happens if all the students from Greve, whom the government intended to impose on Ishøj, Albertslund and Høje-Taastrup, are going towards Solrød. I wonder if Solrød Gymnasium will be limited in capacity, because otherwise this plan won't work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111230	Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111237	Thank you. Now I wonder a little about the service information provided by the Social Democrat rapporteur. So I would really like to hear something. Now it is the case that the students who live in Greve Municipality can actually risk being placed in a high school really far away from the Count Municipality. So I would really like to hear from the rapporteur whether the rapporteur can confirm that this is the case, as the Social Democrat rapporteur said, namely that from Karlslund to Count and Solrød Gymnasium there is so and so far and that this is, like, where the pupils will go. Because that is not really the case in my optics.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111311	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111314	I can agree entirely with the Conservative questioner. Count Gymnasium is not in the distribution zone with Solrød Gymnasium. Solrød Gymnasium is in what is called a distance zone, and therefore the high schools to which students from Greve will be forcibly relocated are high schools in Ishøj, Høje-Taastrup and West Forest in Albertslund. From my own address it takes public transport for example an hour to get to the high school in Albertslund, so I can completely confirm the interpretation that the Conservatives ask.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111343	Brigitte Klintskov Jerkel, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111345	Thank you. It is also the case that in the municipality of Greve there is a town called Tune, which has a very, very strong sports association life and engages many of the young people in sport. It is the case that many of the students attend a high school in Roskilde because it is right up against Tune, so they have approx. 15 minutes to their high school. Now they can actually risk that with this forced distribution they get a journey time of one and a half hours each way. Does the rapporteur agree with me that this is worrying, as it could affect the opportunities for young people to participate in sport and to have a leisure job because they now have to spend their time on transport?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111422	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111423	Yes, I fully agree with the Conservatives' question, and I also wondered why the Socialist rapporteur used to be neglecting that with apostasy in relation to transport time. There is a report made by the Minister of Education's officials, so those with whom the Minister of Education is speaking right now, which shows that each time you increase the distance to a high school by 10 km, the drop-out rate increases by 0.5%. That is why an agreement is made here with open eyes. It is the Ministry of Education's own officials who have made the report which is going to increase the dropout on youth education. I don't think that's a good idea.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111457	Sir. Rasmus Stoklund, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111459	As such, it sounds a classic example of how to solve integration problems and, unfortunately, it is beginning to hurt a little. But you could understand that earlier on, sir. Morten Dahlin, that today we have almost complete freedom of choice, and that is not true. Well, there is no free admission to Danish secondary schools today; there are limitations today. So that picture that we're going from a scenario where everyone can do exactly what they want to do to another scenario doesn't fit. Second, Mr. Morten Dahlin is always such a picture where he says that the young people are playing pieces on such a social democratic board game. How, then, does this relate to the fact that young people have just advocated this model which the Socialist Government has now helped to put forward as a legislative proposal? Since the young people themselves have spoken for the model, why should they be referred to as gaming pieces?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111549	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111551	I have to say that neither has youth. Youth doesn't have any voice in Denmark, so because some left-wing student organisation thinks it's a good idea, the whole youth thinks it too. So I think the rapporteur knows that too. Then I have to say that we have a system today with a rather high degree of freedom of choice in schools, and now we want to introduce a model with a lesser degree of freedom of choice in schools. And one element is inserted, and I do not think that the Socialist rapporteur even mentioned it very skilfully. The parameter from which future high school students are to be distributed is how much their parents earn. In other words, you will be dividing young people into three categories based on how much their parents receive in salary: high income, middle income and low income. Then you apply to a gymnasium... every gymnasium gets a quota... and if the quota is exhausted for the category in which your parents pay, you are forced into another gymnasium. Honestly, is this really a core social democratic policy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111651	Sir. Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111652	In Herlev there is a very fine high school. The reason I am going to go into this now is because the rapporteur used to think that transport time is a major problem. I know that today there are a lot of young people in Herlev who are otherwise a very mixed town where we live together on a cross-country basis. Ballerup to go to high school instead of going to the high school that is just around the corner and where you could obviously go, since you are a mixed city, where we are fairly representative in terms of cross and cross social and ethnic divides. However, I would just like to know whether the rapporteur cannot confirm that we would have reduced transport time by this model, because then high schools that reflect the population would be obtained shortly from where people actually live.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111734	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111736	No, I can't confirm that. I have not seen any figures showing that this model leads to less transport time, on the contrary. And we must remember that the young people in Herlev's free choice will also be limited. Well, the young people in Herlev who actually want to go to high school in Ballerup will have less chance of it in the future. Then I would just like to return to the principle, because this is a fundamental and ideological discussion. Should it be how much your parents are paid to decide where you go to school, or should it be your own free choice? Well, we think the last. Unfortunately, although I am trying to convince them to do the opposite, the social democracy seems the first.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111809	Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111811	Thank you so much. In New Citizens we have been opposed to forced distribution from the very beginning, and it is very, very good to see that we are relatively united in the bourgeois opposition. I would just like the rapporteur of the Left to confirm that, after the next election, by a bourgeois majority, we are going hard to get rid of this red muck of a high school agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111833	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111834	I can confirm that it will be the Left's goal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111839	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111843	Thank you. I'll look forward to it. Furthermore, we would also like to see a new high-school agreement negotiated in general, in which free choice is genuinely guaranteed and some of the inappropriate things that are in the system we have today are also dealt with.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111853	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111855	Copy that. And I would hope that those negotiations can start after the next elections when, hopefully, there is a blue majority.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111902	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. And that means that we can move on to Mrs. Strøjer-Schmidt Strejer-Schmidt, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407111911	Thank you for the floor. Our rapporteur in this area is very sorry that he cannot be here today himself. I'll give his speech instead. During the summer we landed the agreement for a new distribution of pupils in the high schools, and in the SF we are both happy and proud of it, because it was crucial that we found a new model • a model that holds hands during the closed high schools and makes sure that our young people live in diverse environments, and a model that at the same time ensures education throughout the country, because only in this way can we give the students a real free choice. It succeeded in establishing an agreement that can do just that, and it is a huge victory. First, the agreement ensures that it is no longer a question of having the lowest postal code in order to be admitted to a high school in Copenhagen, and in this way we also ensure that our young people do not crawl together according to socio-economic or cultural backgrounds. It is therefore very important that our young people are in environments that reflect our society and not only make friends who are similar to themselves. With the agreement here we guarantee the real freedom of choice of young people, no matter where they come from, so that they can seek exactly the direction of study they want, and precisely the high school they dream of. At the same time, we support the student base of the high schools which, due to the current search pattern, are particularly hard hit. For the biased distribution has resulted in a number of colleges having experienced a marked decrease in the number of applicants, and this has led to a poor spiral. At the end of the day, it has a huge impact on the opportunities offered by schools and can put them in a position to close down, and that cannot be done. Our young people must have the opportunity to train throughout the country. Therefore, it was crucial for SF that we secure the student base with the agreement, so that the most challenged schools can get back on course. We are very pleased that we are now both reducing the competition that has existed between high schools and abolishing waiting lists. For it has been biased between the high schools and created bad environments in the less sought-after high schools. So, of course, the SF agrees with the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112107	There is a brief comment. Sir. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112109	If we put aside the socialist reasons for wishing to force students on the basis of parents' income and then just briefly focus on the well-being of the individual pupil, then SF's rapporteur acknowledges that a high school student, for example. lives in the City of Copenhagen and who is told that because of their parents' income they are going to Høje-Taastrup and go to high school, a deterioration in the quality of life has everything else equal to if the student could be allowed to go to a high school in the City of Copenhagen where the student lives?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112150	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112152	That's hypothetical. We do not know either myself or the rapporteur whether the student would be better off going to high school in the city with pupils who look like him or whether the student would actually be comfortable with classmates who do not look like him. We don't really know anything about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112214	Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112215	Oh, yes, we know, and we know from the fact that the student prefers to be inside that city or municipality when he or she is going to high school, in which he or she lives. That is why we should take it as a starting point and say: that is probably what is best for them, because that is what they want. Then we can get a proper answer to the question: does the rapporteur recognise that this reform will reduce the quality of life of a lot of young people who are forced to go to high school far away from their homes because the government and the SF have ideological goals?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112251	Thank you! The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112252	I recognise that there are some pupils who will not be given their first priority, but that is also the case today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112301	Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112302	Thank you. In fact, I thought that the Socialist People's Party was a party which actually cared about the well-being of young people, but I can see that they are not. Because we are now adopting an agreement which is diametrically opposed to what the young people themselves want. It is actually an agreement which means that if they want to move high school because of dissatisfaction, it is also the head of the high school who has to approve that they have to move because they thrive badly. What is this? The rapporteur must therefore give an answer to this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112347	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112348	First of all, I believe that most school leaders will agree to move the pupil if it is justified. Secondly, I think that if you follow politics a little, you know very well that the well-being of young people is an agenda that is very high on the list for the SF. However, other issues are also high on the SF agenda, and it is, for example, that we not only associate with those who resemble us most, but also with children and young people from other social classes, because we believe that it gives the best cohesion in our society.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112428	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112429	I know that the Socialist People's Party is a socialist party which is in favour of coercion, we are all aware of this, but I am disappointed that it is open-minded to enter into an agreement which is so gambled with the well-being of young people. I'm actually a little shocked.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112451	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112452	We have therefore also said that we must take it on an ongoing basis and see if there are any challenges, and then, of course, we must adapt it. But that is always the case with new policies. We cannot know in advance in concrete terms how it behaves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112507	Sir. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112510	I would like to continue on that track about the well-being of young people. We are experiencing historically high figures, compared to how many young and especially young women are miserable. I know it's an agenda that recorded the SF. The rapporteur has just mentioned that this is one of the highest priorities of the SF. That is why I would just like to ask the rapporteur: what effect does the SF think it has on the well-being of young people when they reduce their free choice and when they extend their journey time to and from their place of education? What effect does SF expect to have on young people's well-being? Will it improve, will it deteriorate, or is it expected to be the same?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112550	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112552	I don't think it's gonna get any worse. I think we need to put things in a completely different place. In high schools we must be able to give better support to the students if they thrive badly in relation to where they can go, what help they can get and can get more help than they get today. I do not think it is this reform that is going to cause the young people to be miserable much more than they are today. I simply do not believe that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112620	Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112621	But should we not take action before young people need help and support? SF's answer is now that when they feel bad, we have to help them. We know, as we know from the Ministry of Education's own figures, that when you increase the distance to an educational establishment by 10 km, the drop-out rate increases by 0.5%. Does not the rapporteur say that it is because people do not thrive? I guess most people don't feel so good at their school that they drop out. I guess you do because you don't feel very well where you are. Does it not make SF think about voting in favour of a bill that will increase the dissatisfaction of young people?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112655	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112656	As I said, we do not believe that this is causing the misfortune to rise enormously. That is simply why we can see ourselves in the agreement plus that there are other things in it, such as that we hold hands during other high schools. We also think it is important to be able to attend high school throughout the country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112715	Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112717	Thank you. Professor emeritus Niels Egelund says, and I quote: Mistrust and rootlessness are all elements of research connected with the forced relocation of young people. Doesn't it make an impression on the Socialist People's Party when a professor goes out and says this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112737	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112739	Forced transfer? Yes, but I think you can get a good high school programme if you don't get your first priority, but most people get one of their priorities. I think it's also a lot about how to start high school. It's something else if you're forced to move while you're in a process. Well, it's about how to get a good high school start, get a good friend group in the class you're going to go in, which hopefully is diverse, which is one of the objectives of this reform.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112819	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112820	Thank you. It is of course really interesting that one does not relate to what a professor says and says that one believes a great deal when we have some science that says otherwise. Well, that's marvellous. They are then said to have one of their wishes fulfilled, and they must write on four wishes. Then everything else is also easier to achieve, but one is only assured that one does not get a completely different type of youth education. That's the only insurance it gives. Doesn't the SF admit it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112854	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112855	Yes, but I must also say that I am not the rapporteur in this area. So if you have a mase question, I would ask you to address them to the SF's rapporteur afterwards. I would, of course, like to be able to reply in detail, but I am simply not the rapporteur in this area. I think you all know that sometimes you make a speech for someone else.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112916	Mrs. Heidi Bank, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407112919	So, of course, we accept that apology from the rapporteur. We may just be wondering why we are going in and making legislation for the country's future students and the distribution of them across the country, and then sending a replacement saying that we should ask questions afterwards. I don't think that's taking the students and the families seriously. So it wonders. I will then allow myself to put a question to the rapporteur, and now we can understand why we cannot get a proper answer in relation to the position on well-being. How, then, in terms of climate and in relation to the long journey time that many, many more students will experience when they are forced to move to high schools further away? After all, it is a matter of getting up to an hour's transport each way. What has the SF's rapporteur or successor done about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113011	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113013	I would like to start by saying that I believe that everyone in this Chamber, all politicians, has tried to have someone to make their speech because they had to do something or they have got sick or anything else, and I think the rapporteur will also see that one day and then perhaps better understand the situation about the fact that you cannot answer everything. In relation to climate, that may be a point, but, as I said, there are other considerations in this agreement that we attach great importance to. So maybe it'll come too short, but we give priority to going into classes with students coming from different backgrounds. This is very important to us because we believe that it has an impact on the cohesion of our society.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113056	Heidi Bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113057	Thank you. Well, that was pretty clear talk. What I then understand is that SF prioritises that the country's high schools must solve a failed integration challenge with this agreement, and that climate and well-being thus weigh less. But thank you for your answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113119	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113121	I have no further comments to make.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113137	Then we would like to thank the rapporteur. No, I'm sorry, there's one more brief comment. Mrs. Mette Abildgaard, the Conservative People's Party, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113154	Thank you. I have also asked for the floor to ask the rapporteur a question of principle which does not necessarily have anything to do with the basic essence of the agreement in detail. I would just like to ask the principle of taking young people who have freedoms in their lives, who live an independent life, and then tell them that their parents' income nevertheless has an impact on the opportunities they have in life. You may be told that no, you cannot get into the high school that you want because your parents' income is too high or too low or too average. I would like to ask you about the principle, with the SF's view, that young people's choices are reduced by their parents' income.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113236	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113237	Well, we know that it has a positive effect on the weak learners when they can reflect themselves in some strong learners, and it can then have a consequence for the strong learners. However, I just do not recognise that this has the negative effect on the resourceful pupils or pupils who come from an economically strong background, because I think that the students too benefit from associating with friends with a different background just to get a better understanding of how our society really is connected. You don't get a good insight into that if you never meet someone who doesn't look like you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113320	Mrs. Mette Abildgaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113321	So the SF's rapporteur believes that it is up to us politicians to define who it is healthy for you to be around, and then we must set up a political system that meets the political objective of associating with them, it is healthy for you to be around, and that means using every means, including parents' income. Is that correct?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113342	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113343	Yeah, in this example, it is. Well, you're still away young and not grown-up. I think that when you are an adult, you can choose who you want to hang out with, and you can do that in high schools too, but I just think it is important that you have met children and young people from another background as a general education until you are an adult, in fact. And I do not think that this is a huge disadvantage for the resourceful students.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113418	Then I shall not see any further brief comments. We thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Jakob Silverhøj from Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113433	Thank you. With the bill here, we are taking a next step in implementing the agreement on the distribution of pupils in upper secondary education that we concluded last summer. In the Enhedslisten, we are very pleased that we are now finally dealing with the problems of the distribution of pupils and the capacity of upper secondary education, which, as has already been said in the debate, has been discussed for years. This is true both in terms of correcting the whole social imbalance, which has long influenced the composition of pupils in many high schools in large cities, and in relation to the upper secondary education in the sparsely populated areas, which has not filled much in the debate so far in this Chamber, but where it has become increasingly difficult to maintain a sufficient student base to maintain local educational institutions close to the pupils. It should also be noted that we are extremely pleased that the proposal curbs the struggle for pupils that we have experienced in the educational institutions; that we are getting rid of the very fierce competition that has been between the institutions, which in our view has not benefited the area. I would say, even on the pretext of the preliminary debate, that one can say that the model we have agreed is not distinguished by its simplicity. This is also evident from the many detailed questions in the Chamber, and I would say that we have a very important task, not least of a communication nature, towards the implementation of the agreement here, because for many people it is undeniable that it may appear a little incalculable in its form. That is why we have also agreed between all the parties to the agreement that there can be a lot of detail in this new, complex way of doing things that have not been possible to see right down to the individual detail of the negotiation process, and that is why we have also nicely agreed with each other that there should be an opportunity to adjust along the way. I think that is quite natural. We welcome in the Enhedslisten the fact that there is an entirely positive attitude among the various parties and actors that we are embarking on the changes that lie in the legislative proposal. We note that there are also some critical comments in the consultation responses. I have read them very carefully, which is why it is also important that, throughout implementation, we are in a very close dialogue with the school partners. We have listened to the various parties involved in the negotiations, and I have the impression that both the Ministry and, at least I can assure at least one of the rapporteurs I believe all of them, are very aware that we have the close dialogue so that we make adjustments where they may be needed. It is our view that with the new allocation rules and, above all, the tighter management of capacity, we can ensure a more diverse composition of pupils in the high schools in the large cities. We think this is very good and, by laying down the new capacity rules on minimum capacity, we can prevent a number of local educational establishments in the country from succumbing. This is generally important, and it will be no less important if we have a movement in the youth years, which means that for the next 7-8 years we can look forward to a significant decline in the youth years, while it is rising again from 2030. Had we not done anything on that agenda, we would have been at great risk of local educational institutions being shut down and, on the other hand, we did not have training in the vicinity of young people to offer when the youth years turn back. So all in all, both in terms of the distribution of pupils and in terms of ensuring education throughout the country, we think this is a good agreement and we support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113905	Thank you. There are a number of brief comments, first from Mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407113910	The Socialist Movement, as Mr. Jakob Silverhøj is a part of, has had many bad historical experiences in allowing the target to justify the means, so that having something that one can set as a shining goal on the horizon leads to one being willing to go over corpse in order to achieve that goal out there in the great world. You'd think it'd taught socialists something. Yet here we come to this bill, where socialism in Denmark believes that it is nice that people see something to each other across class distinctions and income differences, justifies busting young people around with coercion in the country to the high school where they can be together and class with some whose parents have some other income than their own parents have. Is there a time when socialists are learning that the goal does not justify any means, and could this time perhaps appropriately start now and here with this bill?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114015	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114017	Even reasonable targets never justify any means at all. I'd say that I think the obsessive rhetoric is incredibly big. Well, there really isn't a lot of compulsion in this. The agreement is based on the free choice of pupils, and it is true that not everyone will have their first priority, but then we have built it up so that there are priorities below, so that if you do not get your first priority, you are very likely to have your second or third priority. Perhaps we really had a feeling of reassurance for Mr. Ole Birk Olesen probably imagined a model that was more controlled by admission, because we really thought it was good if we could create a district model for the distribution of pupils, but there has not been a majority for that, and that is why we think this is the second best model.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114115	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114117	This bill is filled with coercion. We live in a society where we pay world-record taxes to the public, and in return we can get some benefits. That's what Mr. Jakob Sølvhøj stands for here, is that this with the provision of a high school benefit to your children for the money you have been charged with, must be dependent on one being willing to take the high school which a red majority in the Folketing incurs, based on the income of the parents. So of course this is full of compulsion, but can a socialist see coercion when it bites the socialist in the butt?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114157	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114159	In other words, it is a question of regulating the area, it is indisputable. I don't recognize the obsessive rhetoric. We have had the view that there was an unfortunate pupil composition in very many high schools in the big cities. We have had the impression that it was really important that there were educational institutions close to the individual pupil. In order to solve these problems, we have chosen to regulate admission to large cities according to the social composition, and out around the country we have set a minimum capacity. This may also mean that individual pupils have to travel a little longer, but it ensures that we have educational institutions throughout the country. We think that's good.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114241	The next question is from Mrs Mette Abildgaard, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114244	I understand very well that Enhedslisten's rapporteur is pleased with this agreement, and it is clear from the rapporteur that we are delighted with this agreement, because Enhedslisten could have written every word in this text of the agreement, so fox red it is. What puzzles me is that so many parties, including the Radical Left and the Danish People's Party, have been included in this agreement, where you go in and choose to forcibly transfer students around according to their parents' income in order to achieve some kind of equality that, if you are a member of the Enhedslisten, you are guaranteed to dream about at night. I would just like to ask Enhedslisten's rapporteur: how many other areas of our society should this spread to where we should go and say that there must be so and so many percent in each income group in order to achieve the total politically-ideologically composite society • our day institutions, our primary schools, our nursing homes? Are we going to say to our old man: No, unfortunately, you've made too little money into your life, you can't go to this nursing home? Or should we say, you've made too much money in your life, you can't go to this nursing home? Is there any limit?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114343	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114345	It may seem as if I am unusually happy with this agreement. I would like to say that this is not something we have proposed. We did not want the distribution to be that way. We would have liked there to be district gymnasiums. We had found it very reasonable that the absolute rule was that the pupils went to school close to where they live. There was no political majority in favour of this. Nor was there under the previous government; we made proposals here in the Parliament to introduce secondary school districts to ensure that young people actually went to school where they lived. The Conservative People's Party strongly opposed this. So no, it hasn't been our first choice. On the other hand, when an agreement had to be reached between different parties that solved the problem, with a biased social division of pupils and the problem of providing educational institutions in the country, we think this is a sensible agreement. But that is not something we have brought to the negotiating table. But we have made a compromise with other parties.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114449	Mrs. Mette Abildgaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114451	This really shows that some of the parties that have then been the leader in this process have overtaken the Enhedslisten inside in relation to the desire for this equality-making, and that is actually very interesting. But I did not quite get an answer to my question, namely whether it is supposed to be extended to other areas. If there should now be a minister in the primary school sector who wanted to do something similar there, because you see that there is a problem, that there are some schools where, for example, there are too many wealthy parents who have their children, and you want to say that instead of creating a new division of distinctions to break it up, how does the Enhedslisten stand?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114527	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114529	I would not rule out the fact that we are having a discussion on how the distribution of pupils in our primary school is going to work. It's been running a long time, so I'm sure we'll have a debate on that. I would say that our starting point is not that this should be copied into other areas. That is a concrete solution. And when the rapporteur says this with the parties that have been the leading party in the discussion, it has to be said that the Conservative People's Party has perhaps been during the last period of government. But not many solutions have been provided.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114605	The next brief remark is from Mrs Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114608	Thank you. I know that the rapporteur is very concerned about health and distrust and that young people are doing well. That is why I would also like to quote to the rapporteur Niels Egelund, as I did to the previous rapporteur: 'Miss and rootlessness are all elements which research has been put into the forced relocation of young people. ▪ What does the rapporteur think when a professor goes out and says this will lead to more dissatisfaction?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114639	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114641	How am I supposed to say that? It is not always that Niels Egelund's assessments can be transferred one to one of my positions in education policy. However, I have absolute respect for an approach that says: yes, we must ensure that students are given the greatest possible level of well-being. I really do not think that this will lead to a deterioration in the overall well-being of students, but I recognise that we are making a new regulation and that some pupils will not have the wish that they had. The fact that some students can have longer transport time may then affect the individual pupils, but we have to say that here we have tried to make a solution which, overall, is also of the greatest benefit to the well-being of the pupils. Whether that will be the case will show up once we have implemented the agreement and hopefully are well underway.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114738	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114739	Thank you. It's an interesting answer that it's the crowd and not the individual you're looking at. There you can see the difference between the two of us sitting in this Chamber. Does this mean that the rapporteur thinks that it is okay to move individuals around against their desire to resolve an integration policy that is totally failed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114808	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114809	No, we should not just move around on individual individuals, but we have to recognise that there has not been a free choice in the field of high school so far. Well, if we say, yes, there was a free choice before, and now there is no free choice. There was free choice before, but a lot of people couldn't actually get the wish they had. There is free choice now with the construction we have made, but not everyone can have their wishes fulfilled. No, we're not gonna move the kids around like they were pieces. As far as possible, we must try to protect the interests of the individual as well, but sometimes it is a balance between collective interests and individual interests. And in such a balance one cannot, by its very nature, satisfy all individual interests; it gives a bit of itself.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114855	The next brief remark is to Mr. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114859	The rapporteur says that there is no freedom of choice today. At any rate, today there is no system in which parents' income determines which high school they can go to. I would really like to ask the rapporteur why Enhedslisten thinks it is fair that the son of a cash aid recipient and an early retirement in Odense will get this message: The high school closest to where you live cannot be allowed to enter simply because your parents earn too little. If, on the other hand, they were in work, if they were resourceful and had a higher income, there was free access to high school. But because parents make too little money, the local high school is closed to the son of the early retirement and cash benefit recipient. How does Enhedslisten justify it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114948	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407114950	I note that the questioner is very concerned about being able to attend high school where you live. Therefore, I must say that it is strange that one was so fiercely opposed to exactly the proposal when Enhedslisten put it in the Folketing. Well, we suggested that we make a district model, so if you lived in Greve, you went to the high school in Greve as the absolute rule. But there has not been a majority in favour of this. That is why we have had to find another way of regulating it, and I think it is very sensible and good that we regulate our education at the level of youth education, so that we take into account the fact that young people come from other social classes. There we have therefore chosen to regulate it in this way, as the principle of subsidiarity did not mean anything to the Left in the last period when they sat in the ministerial post and therefore there was no majority in favour of it. I really think that it is okay to rely on income, because it ensures that it becomes a social distribution of pupils.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115054	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115055	What matters to the Left is the student's free choice. And I noted that the rapporteur did not really answer my question. Perhaps that is because it is a little difficult for the rapporteur to answer. But why does Enhedslisten think it's fair? Why does Enhedslisten think it is in accordance with the socialist principles to tell the son of a cash benefit recipient and early retirement: Your parents do not earn enough money for you to go to the local high school? How can that be fair?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115124	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115126	If you want a distribution of the pupils, where we have a greater diversity, and have wanted to be based on the social conditions for the pupils, we have considered that the income base is the best starting point. There have been other approaches to this. Some have thought that it was the ethnic origin of the young that should be governing. Others have believed that it was the postal code that should be governing. I am not in favour of the last two variants, and we have therefore chosen to say that it is the social conditions that must be governing, and there is, after all, income an excellent parameter to control.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115209	Thank you. The next is Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115213	Thank you so much. It doesn't surprise anyone that Enhedslisten thinks this is a good deal. It is such basic social engineering, and one can be tempted to say that it is a planned economy, just with children as pawns. I would like to hear one thing from the rapporteur, because the rapporteur is very much using these terms, which are generally heard from the left: I think... - We assume... - Yes, sir. I guess that's how it's gonna be. Can the Enhedslisten not just confirm me that there is no evidence to suggest that the forced distribution of high school pupils, either from a well-functioning high school to an immigrant gymnasium or vice versa, will have any beneficial effect, and moreover that there is a very, very limited effect in relation to what is called the classmate effect, and that it is also very difficult to qualify it? Can the rapporteur not confirm that this agreement is based on gut feeling and not on evidence?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115313	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115314	I still do not recognise that this is a compulsory division. In fact, the opposite is the case: we have made an agreement based on the fact that the pupils must be able to choose where they want to go on the course, but since the buildings cannot contain an infinite number of pupils, we also have a regulation on the capacity. Whether it's made of gut feeling or not? No, it's not. Very thorough studies have been carried out by the Ministry, which I have been informed of, which has shown what this would mean in relation to a diversity of pupil composition, in relation to transport time, but as has been shown very clearly and openly presented, it is some estimates that have been made in the Ministry. I suppose they are made as well as possible, but that does mean that there is some uncertainty as to how exactly this is going to fall out when it is implemented, and that is exactly why we have also agreed that the parties to the agreement can then go in to adjust if we consider that it is needed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115425	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115427	I think it seems a little paradoxical. Now I wasn't talking about transport time or how many of the kids are at which high schools. I am talking about the professional basis for the fact that the compulsory distribution of pupils at all seems to have the effect that both Enhedslisten and the Socialist People's Party have also had to say. So this is what you've been talking about before, the so-called classmate effect, where you automatically get some beneficial effects from this slightly wider composition of students. What is the evidence of this if the rapporteur says that it is not just made out of gut feeling?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115508	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115509	I am of the clear opinion that, in relation to what is called the classmate effect, I am familiar with the fact that I cannot shake them out of the sleeve. I made lots of studies that give at least a very high probability that the fact that you have mixed classes and students from different layers has a positive effect, because it helps to lift the pupils who come from non-housing homes, or whatever we have to say about it, overall. I cannot shake a precise study out of the sleeve, but it is my view that there is fairly clear evidence of this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115552	Then there is a brief comment on Mrs Britt Baker, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115554	This agreement is simply so crazy that not even a member of the Enhedslisten will stand by the fact that it is a matter of forced division. That's pretty paradoxical. The rapporteur said just now: I do not recognise that this is a matter of coercion. What would the rapporteur call it when you force students from one place to go to a certain high school somewhere else? How do you define it in the Enhedslisten if it isn't coercive?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115626	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115627	Well, you apply to high schools in the model we've made. As number one, you are looking for what you want to do, as number two, you are looking for what you want to do next, and then you are looking for number three what you would like to do if you didn't come up with one of the first two. And one cannot be quite sure that one is satisfied with one's wishes, just as one has not been able to do so in the previous model. So no, I don't recognize that there should be a forced model where we just move the students around. We have built up a model based on the students' free choice, but we cannot meet the wishes of every student. It is simply not possible in such a system of distribution or in any system of distribution if we do not imagine that we have an infinite capacity on the individual colleges.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115717	Mrs. Britt Baker.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115719	Well, that's quite correct: the students must apply for four different places, but the students are not guaranteed one of the four places. The students may be forced to another high school, as the rapporteur knows very well. So when the rapporteur says that this is good for free elections, I just have to ask quite specifically: will free elections be restricted or will there be a greater degree of freedom of choice for the individual learner?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115747	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115748	Overall, I do not think it will be limited, but for some it will be. There's no reason to go through Copenhagen's surrounding municipalities here, so it's gonna be tiring, but there are plenty of places where you have no chance of getting in, that is, if you apply to a high school in the area where we are standing. It is also a kind of compulsion that you have to stay out there where you live. But there is no compulsion. This is an agreement based on the free choice of pupils, but we cannot accept every wish in such an agreement. That is simply not possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115827	There are no more brief comments and we would like to thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mrs Gitte Willumsen, Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407115845	Thank you, President, and thank you for the floor. Today we are discussing a government bill on capacity-setting and the distribution of pupils in upper secondary secondary education. For the Conservative People's Party, it is a bit absurd that we sit here and discuss how we should take freedom from young people. We sincerely believed that there was a majority of parties in the Folketing that weighted personal freedom over government. Yet the government has succeeded in finding a majority to rob young people of free secondary school elections. We are talking about a socialist experiment in which students are forced into high schools which they have not chosen for themselves, on the basis of their parents' income and without the slightest regard for their own interests. It's absurd. The agreement lays down that pupils should be allocated to high schools which are up to an hour's transport away from their homes, as well as to each road, simply because their parents earn a little too much or little too little according to the government. We think it is deeply unfair. Young people do not choose their own parents. With this law, young people will transport themselves across and cross municipal boundaries in order to fulfil the government's forced distribution model. In the Conservative People's Party, we want to safeguard free elections. We do not believe that it is the task of the state to force young people into certain high schools. Young people know best themselves where they want to go. They must have the opportunity to stay in the local youth environment that they know, if that is what they want. It's well-being and security. I understand that one would prefer to go to a high school with one's good friends and close to one's home and where one can cultivate one's leisure interests. Young people have the right to their free choice. We can't take that away from them. Force increases dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, increased apostasy, and gives young people poorer high school hours. On 24 March, among others, he wrote: Niels Egelund i Politiken: "Mistriculture and rootlessness are all elements that research is associated with the forced relocation of young people. Do we not usually rely on research and empire? We can't be familiar with this. This is out of order. It is quite, quite wrong that we are gathered here today to take freedom from young people. The Conservative People's Party cannot support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120151	Thank you. There are some brief comments. First, it's sir. Jens Joel, the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120155	Thank you. It is something baroque to discuss that you take the free choice of a generation when we expect to 84 per cent. It will be their first priority and, moreover, it will be possible now, with the future model, to choose also high schools which are far away from where you live, if that is what you want, or perhaps the high school that is right next door, but which in the present system has gone wrong, and which you do not want and is then in the back of the queue everywhere else. So there is no free choice today, and there will be a concern for free choice in the new model too. However, the Conservative People's Party has taken a great deal of interest in wanting to do away with parallel societies and with what has been called ghetto schools and with the unequal distribution. So I just have to ask: what is the Conservative People's Party's solution to that problem?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120251	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120252	Thank you for the question. If we have high schools that produce poor results that no young people will seek, then we have no worries about closing anyone down. We can close a high school and then strengthen the good ones rather than move someone to something they don't want and that works badly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120320	Sir. Jens Joel.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120321	But respect for saying that you want to close it! I think that Mrs Gitte Willumsen and I can agree that this does not mean that the young people disappear. You know, I don't quite understand what the issue is here. Well, there's got to be some people who don't get the local high school, don't have a high school close by or don't have the high school they'd like to have chosen. You don't have a problem with that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120348	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120349	We understand that there are then high schools that are not on the Danish map forward-looking. That's the way it's gonna be if you close a high school. But we should not force anyone into a high school that is bad, just to fill it up because there are some bricks. You have to be where you want to be and where there is quality.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120406	The next brief remark is to Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120411	I think I heard the rapporteur say that it is not a state task to distribute pupils. I just want to ask: whose job is that? And is it the case that the Conservative People's Party has so far believed that there should be no student-sharing rules at all? That is not what I have heard the Conservative People's Party say. I have not heard that party say that we must abolish the current rules on the distribution of pupils and have complete freedom of entry for pupils.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120441	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120442	Today, it is the regions that are aware of the distribution of pupils. After all, it is somewhat closer to a democratic process than the proposal that lies here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120457	Mrs. Anne Sophie Callesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120458	It is true that it is the regions that distribute according to some rules that we have adopted in the Folketing. I just need to understand whether it is the case that the rapporteur wants us to continue with the current rules on the distribution of pupils, which means that there are rules for distribution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120511	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120512	After all, the regions can create more classes around the upper secondary schools that exist today. That is why it is closer to a democratic process. So if we have to choose between the two models, we would prefer the one we have today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120527	The next brief remark is to Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120530	Thank you so much. I would just like to ask the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party the same question that I asked the rapporteur from the Left about earlier, namely whether the Conservative People's Party, together with the rest of the bourgeois opposition, will also take the lead in abolishing this red crapper of a secondary school agreement after the next elections, where hopefully there will be a bourgeois majority.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120552	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120554	The Conservative People's Party would very much like that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120558	The next brief remark is to Mr. Rasmus Stoklund, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120603	Thank you. Mrs Gitte Willumsen said something like: I understand that young people want to go to high school close to where they live and with their friends. But does Mrs Gitte Willumsen not agree that this is not the case today? In my own neighborhood, for example. a high school where the young people who live in the same neighborhood do not leave. They take several miles away to go to high school in Ballerup instead, although there is a fine high school just around the corner. So isn't it a little fake to draw up when you say that the young people today actually go to high school close to where they live?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120637	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120643	Today, 90%. their first priority has been met, and with this proposal it will fall to 84 per cent. Now I won't count on percentages this time and Mr. Jens Joel isn't here right now. So today there are more people who will at least have their first priority met, and we could see for ourselves that some more classes could be set up in those high schools where young people really want to be, so there were even more who could before their first priority was met.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120707	Rasmus Stoklund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120709	But when young people from Herlev apply to Ballerup, it is a priority that is due to an opt-out of Herlev more than an option of Ballerup. That's why it's a little fake priority. So, when this agreement shows its effect in a few years' time, you will see that the young people in Herlev move with those with whom they have attended primary school, from primary school on one corner to high school, right on the other corner, and then go together, and then it will be their natural priority. But it is not today, because today the high school is not mixed, and today there is no balance in it. That's why you see that they're traveling far away.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120748	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120749	Now I feel that I recognise the choices that young people make and I am not saying that it is because they choose something from. I recognise that this is a choice. So, as far as I am concerned, the first priorities that young people are coming up with today are justified by the fact that they want them to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120809	The next brief remark is from Mr. Jacob Sølvhøj, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120812	Thank you. I'd like to hear a little bit about what the alternative to what we've done is. I mean, are we gonna have such a pure market management of this? Should it be so that if there is what we now call an overapplication it would not be for high schools then, by definition, you have to regulate the dimensioning up so that there will be the number of seats corresponding to students who have sought? And vice versa to the sparsely populated areas: if there is a strong move towards the big cities, should we recognise that we will just shut down the small high schools in the countryside when the market does not regulate it by the fact that there are few who are looking for them? Is this the kind of regulation that the rapporteur thinks we should have?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120904	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120905	In the model set up here, you want to make an IT solution and some djøfs who have to sit and work with it, where you want to spend 197 million. kr. On it. Well, this money could be better spent doing some of the high schools out in the sparsely populated areas better. Then we believe that it will be chosen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120927	Sir. Jacob Silver Mound.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120928	Yes, but what I really would just like the rapporteur to do about it, because I myself have been met with a lot of reflections about the fact that here there was particular coercion that characterised the proposal, if it is not true that if you do not have a pure market management, where the dimensioning of the individual educational establishments is a pure accordion, then you have to regulate in such a way that all pupils do not get their wishes fulfilled?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120957	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407120959	But we have said that the system that exists today seems to us to be better, so that is where we have little control. It lies out in the regions and closer to a democratic process, and we would rather choose that than the model that has been developed here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121016	Then there is a brief comment on Mrs Britt Baker, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121020	When I take the floor, it is actually to try to nuance what Mr. Rasmus Stoklund just said, 'cause I think, sir. Rasmus Stoklund made it sound as if it was normal to opt out of the high school that is close to you, to use transport time to get to a high school that is further away. I would therefore like to ask the Conservative rapporteur whether she is aware that there are also places where you go to the local primary school with your classmates from 1 to 9th grade and that the majority of that class then goes on to the same high school. Are there also places in Denmark where this is going on?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121100	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121101	We can see that in the local area I come from. I guess I don't know the numbers at 99 percent. of the young people from Silkeborg Municipality choose the local high school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121118	Mrs. Britt Baker.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121120	Yeah, and that's how it is, really, a lot of places. It is as if the government and the support parties have not considered at all what it would be like to be one of the handful of primary school pupils who have followed along for 9 years, 10 years, and to be picked out, used as a ludobrik and forcibly distributed to another high school. But what does the Conservative rapporteur think it will do about the well-being of the handful of young people?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121152	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121153	Well, I'm really worried about that. Now I have previously sat and worked with health municipal politics and have seen all the well-being studies that have been done in the municipality, and can just see that things are going the wrong way year after year. With this proposal, I am sure that the thriving will be put further under pressure, and the young people will drop out because you cannot understand that you have to travel a long way to get to the high school that the state has now chosen to go to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121228	Then there is a brief comment to Mr. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121231	Thank you to the Conservative rapporteur for the speech. I would just like to ask the Conservative rapporteur to confirm that there is an analysis from the Ministry of Education which says quite clearly that if you increase pupils' distance to their high school by 10 km, yes, then you also increase the drop-out by 0.5%. Well, longer distance from education leads to more apostasy. I guess this deal's gonna give you more distance, so I guess the deal's gonna have to give you more apostasy. Is that correct?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121302	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121303	That is quite correctly understood, and I can confirm it from the real world, from where I live. If you have to go a very long way to get to a youth training course, it has been eud-- there is a very large apostasy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121320	Then there are no more brief comments. We thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Alex Ahrendtsen, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121340	Thank you, President. Sometimes it's a good thing to look back in time. Elections have consequences, decisions have consequences. And the decisions taken in 1983 onwards are the reason why we are here today. It is the old parties, it is the Social Democracy, it is the SF, it is the Radical Left, it is the Left, it is the Conservatives who allowed immigration, which today means that we feel the consequences out there in high schools. You were warned, but you didn't listen, and you saw through your fingers all the warnings that came in the '70s, '80s, '90s and '00s, and even in the 2010s. The Danish People's Party warned against it from 1995 onwards, and others before. Now we could choose to cross our arms and say: What did we say? We don't want anything to do with that. That's what the old parties have to do, because you're the one who's created the miser. We could say: Now you are feeling the consequences for your children and grandchildren. Get the case straightened out. We were also frankly discussing this in our parliamentary group, but we also reached the conclusion that our mandates are working mandates. We have an obligation to conclude agreements when we can conclude agreements. I would also like to be honest and say that the model that ended up in the agreement, which is in the bill, was not the model that the Danish People's Party preferred. As far as I remember, we provided a district model • a different district model than the Enhedslisten, but yet a district model. There was absolutely no support for this from a large number of parties, including the bourgeois parties, and I understand that very well, because that would have meant the abolition of the free elections which the bourgeois parties hold dear. The current model retains free choice, but it is a limited freedom of choice and it is more limited than before. The current free choice is also limited by a large number of other criteria. I would also like to admit that this is not the best model in the world. It's a bureaucratic model. It also increases the randomness of some students. It also increases the journey time of some students. I would also like to say that some of the discussion and debate in this Chamber is a little lied. You're hiding behind the fact that there's free choice. Basically, it is also about many people not wanting more students with a different cultural background and religious background into those high schools where there are not very many of these. It is about wanting to continue the life we have had, where the consequences of immigration and the consequences of multiculturalism have not been very significant, while other areas have had to take the big hitch. These are all the balances we have made in the Danish People's Party, and we then chose despite going in and supporting the agreement, especially because it supports the rural gymnasiums with the distance zones. It provides a basis for these high schools to survive. They are, of course, threatened by less population growth, or indeed there is departure; there are plenty of people moving away. And then they are threatened by the fact that many young people want to go to the cities and go to high school. And as high schools are taximeter-controlled, they will lose their income base. This agreement supports high schools in rural areas, and thus we also retain the possibility of having high schools throughout the country. If we completely removed their opportunity to have a revenue base, we would eventually only have high schools in the big cities, and we do not support this in any way in the Danish People's Party. So all in all, it has been a difficult process for us. We have had many discussions, and I also think it has been an exciting ideological debate in the Chamber. But summa summarum is that the Danish People's Party supports this agreement. And we shall vote in favour at the third reading.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121830	Thank you. There are a number of brief comments. First of all, it is Mrs Britt Baker, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121834	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur for the speech. I am glad that the rapporteur stands by the fact that this agreement restricts free elections, because it does, and I am also very pleased to hear that, after all, there have been discussions in the parliamentary group and that the rapporteur also uses the words: this is not the best model in the world. However, it makes me think about where the Danish People's Party really borders. After all, it is no secret that the Minister will not deny that this should also be extended to primary school. So is it the limit of the Danish People's Party, or is it only when it comes to the nursing homes or is it all the way that the Danish People's Party goes in relation to distribution according to parents' income?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121918	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407121920	This is an excellent question and we have also discussed it. What is the matter with the public schools is that it is, after all, the municipalities that are responsible for the division of districts. There, for years, we have already done what we are doing today, namely to change the districts in order to have a better distribution of pupils. In addition, there is free choice of school, so parents sometimes use the free choice of school to send their children to a school other than in the district. We stayed, for example. in my own district in Vollsmose have to close two out of three schools because parents who used the free choice of school to send their children to schools with many children with Danish background. So it's already going on in primary school. And we're not going to support the state going in and interfering with it. You have to do that locally. I would like to make this very clear from this point of view.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122015	Mrs. Britt Baker.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122017	I'm very glad to hear that. Then I just want to hear something from the rapporteur. He says himself that this isn't the best model in the world. Hopefully there will be a time when this agreement will have to be evaluated. If it turns out that this has significant consequences for the students, among other things. for the well-being of the pupils and also in the form of a great apostasy, is the rapporteur's party willing to look at another model, possibly by a different majority in the Folketing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122045	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122045-2	Well, that's what we do with every deal. If it turns out it doesn't work, then we go in and adjust, and maybe we change it completely. All parties do, and all parties to the agreement do. That goes for this one too, of course. But we are in the agreement, and that is why, of course, we will be voting in favour of this agreement at third reading when it comes to the Chamber.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122111	The next brief remark is from Mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122114	There is no doubt that there have been, and there are also problems with some colleges that act as magnet gymnasiums on pupils with a different ethnic background from Danish, where the high school can then be an extension of a parallel society in which they live, where they live. That is why we must, of course, do something about it. But there is a huge difference between doing something about the problems where the problems are and forcing all sorts of other people who do not have problems to move around the world to solve a problem elsewhere. Could the Danish People's Party really not in the negotiations or in negotiations with itself come up with a model that dealt with problem gymnasiums without making it a problem for all other high schools?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122209	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122210	Well, we suggested a district model, but there was no support for that. I don't think the Enhedslisten really backed up our district model either, but I wasn't in the negotiations. The bourgeois parties could then have helped us to that model, for it had completely avoided arbitrariness, so one knew which high school one belongs to. But the bourgeois parties wanted the continued free choice, and it will only be difficult, because the free choice will mean that if we open it up completely, that there are a few high schools that will attract everyone, and they will then be huge, and then a whole lot of high schools around will be closed. We had our eyes on the rural gymnasiums. They were important to us it was important that they were maintained. And that's what they do with this deal. We guarantee a revenue base for them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122302	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122304	But the solution is there fore: if you find that a certain high school has turned into a problem gymnasium, you close it permanently or temporarily in the hope that the problem will disappear if people find out to look elsewhere in a few years, and then you open it again. Why couldn't you go that way?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122328	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122330	We could have done that, but we did not do so when we sat in the government, so the Liberal Alliance had the post of Minister of Education, but we did not seek that solution because in reality it is not really very easy to do it, as Mr. Ole Birk Olesen suggests. But I don't understand why you didn't do anything about it when you sat with the government. Sir. Ole Birk Olesen was even a minister himself, however, in another ministry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122358	The next brief remark is from Mr. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122402	Thank you to the rapporteur for something that I think is a very honest speech and actually very reflective, and which, of course, also lets us into the discussion room that has been in the Danish People's Party and the considerations that have been expressed for and against. I think that is actually very honest. Thank you, too, for saying that with the free choice, that is, that there will be a restricted free choice. We have heard such a little wool in our mouths from other rapporteurs, who have been told that there will be better distribution of pupils, but one would not really say that the free choice will be cut so actually praise for it. I also hear that the Danish People's Party has been very concerned about the rural model in this, i.e. the distance zones, which is why I would really like to ask the rapporteur something. Let us say that we should now be in the lucky situation, that there will be a blue majority after an election and a new Minister of Education says: okay, let us work on the model for the distance zones that lies, because there are, in fact, some good tactics in it, but we have a challenge inside the distribution zones, because there is simply too much of a cut in the free choice. Could the Danish People's Party then see itself constructively entering into such a dialogue to find a better model there, or will you sit with the majority that you are now part of behind this agreement and say: We will not make changes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122512	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122513	I think we should be honest and say that, of course, the agreements we make until reality has changed the conditions for the agreement that has been reached. And if the conditions are radically changed, I am sure that the current contractual partners will also be interested in possibly adjusting or amending the agreement. It is, of course, a hypothetical situation put forward by the rapporteur, and Mr von der Vring knows that. Martin, no, sir. Morten Morten So, of course, we stand by our agreement and also vote in favour here at the third reading.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122556	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122557	Thank you. Martin Dahlin was a Swedish footballer (Alex Ahrendtsen I know! ) You might call him the black sheep in the family, and I think the rapporteur understood that. Thank you for the answer, which I see as an opening to the fact that if reality shows some of the things we have as concerns, one is willing to sit down and look at it. I'll take that down positively. Now that the rapporteur has taken up the concerns of the rapporteur and the Danish People's Party, what would the rapporteur actually say to the ethnic Danish boy who would like to go to his local high school, where there are mainly ethnic Danes, when he is now forced through one or the other way to go to a high school where there is a predominance of non-western immigrants? What is the Danish People's Party's answer and explanation to him?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122642	Thank you. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122643	The goal would be not to force him to a high school where there is an excess weight. After all, we should like to arrive at a more or less even distribution, so that in the future the high schools which are not doing the job today will be able to take care of the high schools which are doing the job a great deal. But Mr. Morten Dahlin is right: it will always be difficult when it becomes quite concrete, and I will of course understand why he is frustrated.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122716	The next brief remark is from Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122719	Thank you so much. And thank the rapporteur for a very reflected speech. One thing I noticed in the rapporteur's speech was that the rapporteur said that the Danish People's Party did not want to leave the bill in the children's room, as it were. But that's exactly what you do with this deal. For even with these distribution requirements and this max. 30 per cent. there will be some who will be distributed over to some high schools, who will have a very, very large share of the contribution to say that, as is the case with uneducated immigrant boys, who should not go there at all by the way. Does the Danish People's Party not think that this is really the wrong way to go, and that this agreement leaves the bill from the parents' error and the politicians' totally misguided immigration policy with the children?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122813	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122814	In fact, I agree with Mrs Mette Thiesen on that point, and we could take the matter further. In many ways, of course, it is symptom treatment, and it is also to allow institutions to carry out an integration task which is not really their job. What we are left with because of the sins of our fathers is what the children will bear. We warned against what they did anyway. We have then chosen to try to solve the problem. It is not the world's best solution, but it is, after all, a solution. It greatly alleviates rural gymnasiums, and then it relieves a few high schools in the metropolitan area and in the large cities, and then others will lift more. But it's not good.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122908	Thank you. Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122912	Well, I'm also a little bit of an opening to hopefully change it after the next election. I will certainly fight hard to achieve this by a bourgeois majority. But thank you for being very, very honest about it by the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. In New Citizens we have a very, very clear position that it is of course not the children who have to pay the bill for the misguided immigration policy. We must solve the problems from the bottom up. I have said that earlier, but then there is also in the free choice that you can choose something from, and I think that Danish children and young people should have the opportunity to opt out of immigrant gymnasiums, also in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122952	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407122953	In other words, I think it would be best if we were honest about our motives, our considerations and also our arguments as to why we are doing what we are doing. It helps things. For many years we have had a lie about immigration, immigration, cultural backgrounds and religious backgrounds. It has become much better in Denmark, and I therefore believe that we can achieve better solutions through an honest and sometimes tough debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123024	Finally, there is a brief comment from Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123028	Thank you. And also thanks from here for a very honest speech and also for the historical look that was at it. It was nice just to get that sketched out. So would I like to know if DF sees this as a solution to integration, so that we ask young people to take a youth education where they really do not want to be? Is that a good way to solve integration problems?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123057	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123058	No, it is not a good way, but of course it gives young people with a different cultural background than Danish a better opportunity to integrate rather than go to a high school where they have virtually only their own to associate with. The more Danish students they meet, the more they have an opportunity to be better integrated. But in the end it is the individual who can be integrated. If he doesn't want to be integrated, it doesn't matter that he or she is the only one in high school. It starts with the family, it starts with the individual; if they want to integrate, they are also integrated. But it also presupposes that they have something to integrate into and into, and that they meet the lovely Danish culture that we all love, and then in the long term also integrate into Denmark as such. That's what this is all about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123156	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123159	Thank you for your answer. When the rapporteur says that it requires that we also have something to integrate into, I interpret it as if the number matters to the places in question. How does the rapporteur think that the number of ethnic Danes will be high enough in some of these immigrant gymnasiums to succeed in what is the intention of this proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123231	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123232	The number matters. But I am also well aware that in many high schools where, for example, there is one. is 30 or 40%. with a different cultural background than Danish, it is not certain that they interfere with the Danish. Most often they keep to themselves. So it is not a guarantee, but it is certainly a better option, and that is one of them. That is why we have said yes. So, the perspective is that they also integrate into Denmark. That's our hope. If they don't, we're screwed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123304	I do not see any more brief comments, so I would like to thank the rapporteur very much. The next rapporteur is Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123326	The debate we have here today is basically about values. We're at a crossroads. Try to close your eyes and imagine this: The sun shines, the birds sing, you can see the heat wave in the landscape, in front of you lies a dusty dirt road, further ahead it divides into two. If you choose the road to the left, you end up in the cold and dark forest filled with thunderous shrubs and dark trees, the path is lost in darkness. On the other hand, if you choose the other way, the one on the right, you continue along the sun - drenched gravel road with high skys, grazing cattle on both sides and chirping bird whistle from above. For it is actually quite simple: do you choose the road to the left, which the government, the support parties and the Danish People's Party have chosen, with more coercion and less free choice, or do you choose the bourgeois road • a road with more freedom and more free choice? New citizens, of course, choose the latter. In New Citizens we want more freedom and more free choice, which is why we do not want Danish high school students to be used as cones in an integration game and sacrificed on the altar of the failed immigration policy. At the heart of the matter is that in future high schools will have to take up pupils on the basis of their parents' purses, and the fulfilment of young people's educational desires will thus also be conditional on the jobs of their parents. This is the exact opposite of what the government claims to want to achieve, and it is also exactly the opposite of what we want in New Citizens, namely to ensure free elections. In short, high schools should not be used as integration projects and students should not be forced to go to a high school without their friends and far from their homes. That is why a future bourgeois government must sit down to scrap the red people's machinations of a high school agreement. The problems should not just be moved around, they should be solved from scratch. In New Citizens we have been the only party to say no from the start: no thanks to forced distribution. You shouldn't be wrong about what the purpose of this agreement really is. After all, it is precisely to force students into the name of integration. The parties to the agreement addressed the agreement as an attempt to mix pupils on the basis of parents' income in order to create a more socially diverse composition of the country's secondary schools. But in reality it's all about distributing Muslim students into Danish high schools and distributing Danish students into immigrant gymnasiums. From now on, young Danish students cannot be sure that they will be placed in a poor high school with a large proportion of non-western pupils, and that is totally unacceptable. At the expense of decades of failed alien politics, we must not land in the teenage room. The obvious way to avoid state forced distribution is, of course, that parents go together to create private gymnasiums to ensure free elections for their children and other people's young people, but here too the government and its blood-red support parties and the Danish People's Party stick their long fingers into civil society initiatives and limit freedom. In the future, there will be a ceiling on the number of pupils admitted to private secondary schools, because the parties to the agreement know very well that no young people want to be placed in an immigrant high school. The solution to the problems of parallel societies and immigrant gymnasiums is twofold. First of all, we need to solve the immigration policy from the bottom up, so that we get a plug in the influx, because without it the problems will continue and get worse. At the same time, we must solve the specific problem of poorly functioning immigrant gymnasiums, and the obvious solution to this problem must be found by raising the character requirement in order to be admitted to high school to 7. In this way, many of the students who constitute the problem will automatically be sorted out and excluded from going to high school, and frankly, those who cannot behave properly must of course be thrown out. We are at a crossroads today. Do you choose more freedom and more free choice, or do you choose the opposite, less freedom and less free choice? Are you going to the right, or are you going to the left by the path? In New Citizens we are in no doubt, and we have never been. As a bourgeois party, of course, we choose more freedom and more free elections, which is why we again say a clear no to the forced distribution of the left and the Danish People's Party. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123842	Thank you. There is one brief comment. Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123846	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. I can hear that the rapporteur is very concerned about this. In relation to the remark about throwing out those who are not behaving properly, I would say: as it is today, it costs the principal, the high school money, when you throw out a young person who cannot behave properly because you are set off in the taximeter money. Could the rapporteur see a system in which it was said that if it is because of behaviour and bad behaviour that you are thrown out of your upper secondary education, then it will not cost on the bottom line of high school? What does the rapporteur think about this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123926	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123927	I'm thinking that we should generally sit down and look at this taximeter system. I believe, and we generally believe, that the money should follow the individual child. It is clear, of course, that if you throw out a student who behaves badly and creates a very bad environment for the others, it will also benefit the school on the long track. So we would love to sit down and look at the taximeter system, but we basically believe that the money should follow the individual child.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123952	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407123954	Thank you. We find it problematic that it costs high schools money to get rid of someone who doesn't behave properly. And we think it means something to culture in that place. Then I would like to hear New Citizens about this integration agenda, where you try to come up with a solution and where it costs some young people. Where are we gonna land it? We fully agree that it is going to cost some ethnic Danish students that they have made a failed integration policy, but how do we solve it in relation to some of those immigrant gymnasiums? How does the rapporteur view this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124041	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124042	I really think I made this clear in my speech, and now integration is a personal responsibility and not a public task. I know the government, among other things. These people, mostly from Muslim countries, are often referred to as some who have an integration need. That's bullshit. In other words, if you come to Denmark, you have to adapt and assimilate in Danish society, contribute actively etc., and this also applies to these high schools. That's also why I'm saying clearly that if you can't behave, you must be kicked out. That is why we must also put up the requirement to enter high school. We will be able to see quite clearly that if we set it to 7, the drop-out rate will also be somewhat lower. In fact, it goes down pretty clearly after 7. So there are some clear things there. And then, of course, as a Danish well-functioning high school student, you have to be able to choose these bad high schools from.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124127	Thank you. Mr President, there is just one more brief comment to make. Morten Dahlin, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124133	Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. I do not know whether the rapporteur has read the book from the Social Democratic Education Rapporteur, Mr. Jens Joel. He has, of course, written a quite exciting book, and I think that, depending on where one lies ideologically, one will call it either a horror or a comedy, but the rapporteur himself must decide where he proposes to extend the model that has been made in the high school field to include primary school. The Minister has been confronted with this on several occasions, and the Minister has said every time that she is very, very pleased with Mr. Jens Joel's book. I would therefore like to ask whether New Citizens are concerned about whether what we are now seeing in high school could become a slippery slope and also subsequently be introduced in the primary school area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124226	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124227	Yeah, and I've been for years. Because I actually asked the Minister about it down here in the Chamber, I think it was when we dealt with the proposal called L 63, which was around this model of distribution in connection with day institutions in these particularly vulnerable areas, where I specifically asked the Minister if the Minister could see other places, and then the Minister actually replied quite frankly that she could see that. So, yes, I certainly think it's a horror compared to this book, and we're very worried that it should spread out in other areas too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124304	Thank you. Then there are no more brief comments and we thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Ole Birk Olesen of the Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124315	First of all, I want to tell you what it should be like and then I want to talk about what is wrong with what is proposed here by a majority of Parliament. It should be the case that students could seek the high school they would like to seek, and if there is no place in high school, the high school should have an opportunity to expand. It is possible that this cannot be done from year to year, but over time the much-seeked colleges should have an opportunity to expand so that they can take more of the students who are looking for high schools. It comes about through a model, which you can call the money follows the learner, where the high schools get a sum of money for teaching and for rooms, which is a product of how many people want to go to high school. This will then lead to there being other high schools where there is not so much search • it may be for one reason, the other or the third reason which will have problems in sustaining life. That's gotta be it. We don't need high schools for high school. We need high schools for young people, and if young people don't want to go to certain high schools, they shouldn't be forced to go to those high schools to keep those high schools alive. We need to make it easier for small high schools to be small high schools. They must be given an opportunity, for example. offer the subjects that are large and that all students have to go through, and then maybe buy in to the narrow subjects at nearby high schools, so that you have all your Danish and mathematics and history lessons at your local high school, but possibly have to take your Spanish lessons or Russian lessons at a distant high school if the local high school cannot offer the small subjects. That's how it should be. If there are then high schools where there are problems, for example. secondary schools, which have developed into small parallel societies, which act as magnets for young people with a different ethnic background, which there extend the parallel society they live in at home in the housing block to be a parallel society in high school, then, on the basis of different criteria, which also apply to housing blocks, one must be able to say that this gymnasium must go through some kind of renewal process or be closed, either permanently or temporarily, and those who previously sought there must then seek some other colleges. This is the model we want to implement. What you are doing here is saying to young people who want to go to the high school that their older sister has gone to, because it is in the local area that you can't go there, unfortunately, because we need your presence in, for example. Herlev, otherwise there are too many immigrant backgrounds in high school there, so you have to get there and act as dilution, so that those who go there are not too much made up of young people with an immigrant background, so you have to move there and be the thinner who makes sure that we have a good social democratic society also in Herlev. I think that is simply a marvellous admonition and a conductor of the lives of young people, whom we must be a concrete social democrat in order to support. This is where we have an objective that we think is fair and that there are no means to hide from achieving that objective, and if the objective is good, the means are also good, no matter how many bodies we move to the great luminous socialist goal that we are a society in which the son of the cash aid recipient is in the class of the bank manager's daughter. It is amazing that, because you think you have a good idea, you allow yourself that everyone else, including the young people, should just be extras in the good idea that you have set out and that works well in a discussion book and that also worked well when you were a member of the Enhedslisten and political rapporteur for the Enhedslisten and could swing with the red tabs and talk about everything sort of red. But we can't have the young people just being pawns in that game. They have a right to their own lives, and the fact that we in Denmark have such high taxes that you cannot buy your own benefits does not mean that the public authorities can impose exorbitant demands in order to receive a benefit from the government that the taxes paid through life are used to provide. There must be reasonableness in this society, and there's no reasonableness in treating young people like this. The Liberal Alliance is voting against the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124813	Thank you. There are no brief comments. So we thank the rapporteur. I see no rapporteur for the Free Greens or for the Christian Democrats, so now is the time for Mrs Sophie Callesen, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407124835	Thank you for the floor. I'm glad I could get on here at the end, as there were some calendar problems that made me unable to be here earlier. When I have heard this debate, I think that reality calls to some of those who are sitting and criticising this agreement very strongly. This deal takes hold of two serious issues at our high schools. These are issues that reality out there, both teachers, students and rectors, has asked us to resolve. These are also issues on which the Left and Conservatives have called for solutions. The fact that we do not think this solution is perfect is perfectly understandable, but I think that the criticism that we are talking here about compulsory distribution and completely abolishing free choice is very far from reality, especially when it is the case that we do not want to have complete freedom of movement. There I have to say that the Liberal Alliance actually has a solution, which is, of course, that you want just to measure up to the wishes of young people and increase capacity. That is not a solution I agree with, because the problem we have faced in relation to the challenge of integration in high schools has just emerged from the fact that there has been too little control over the capacity of high schools. We have had too free competition which has been harmful in this context for the possibility of running high school on sustainable terms. But now it is evident that any restriction on choosing a high school is completely free and without any rules is forced distribution. I find that very, very difficult to recognise as being reality, and I think that is something that is also being done by those who have called for solutions. That is why I think that with this agreement we are aware of our responsibility. Is that a perfect deal? In the opinion of the Radical Left, this is not a perfect agreement. I think many other rapporteurs have said the same. Of course, we each had our own wishes. We would have liked it to be the regions that could have more control over precisely which criteria would be chosen locally. But there were different wishes, and I think that this is precisely where it retains a free choice and, in reality, goes in and very carefully says that where there are problems, we are dividing up according to different criteria than today; there we divide up more because the problems exist there. On the other hand, in the rest of the country, we do not distribute. And that is why, for example, we are here. did not want a district model, for then all the students had actually been tied up. We did not want that in the Radical Left. So we think that this agreement is an agreement that delivers on the problems of reality, and that is why, of course, we support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125145	Thank you. There are a number of brief remarks. First, it's sir. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125149	The rapporteur mentions that the criticism that has been made does not fit in with reality. Well, I actually asked the rapporteur out to talk to some of the students who will be affected by this. The rapporteur has refused to reply to the invitation. So I would just like to repeat it: I would like to invite the rapporteur to a high school in order to have a dialogue with some of the students who, in the future, will not be able to enter the high school they would like to enter, not because they have done something wrong themselves, but because their parents are earning the wrong amount. So perhaps the rapporteur here from the platform will confirm that the rapporteur is actually going to accept the invitation from reality this time. Then I would just like to ask the rapporteur, who is the rapporteur for a social liberal party, how it is in line with the Radical Left's ideology of freedom, self-determination and free choice, that young people are to be categorized in the future by how much money their parents earn, and that way a system of discrimination is created in relation to whether your father is a director or whether your father is a cash aid recipient.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125259	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125300	It's not true that I didn't answer the invitation. It is true that we have not had an appointment on the calendar. I would like to accept that invitation; I would certainly like to go to Count. Well, maybe it's not gonna turn into Mr. Knox. Morten Dahlin's own arrangement, but I would very much like to go down there, and I have also replied to the rapporteur that my secretary will help find a date for that. Well, then, to answer the second question: we believe that there are already restrictions on free elections, and it becomes a little absurd to keep on hearing that there are no restrictions today, and on forced distribution, etc. Now I cannot ask questions the other way, but I would just like to say that today we are also bound by our parents, in the sense that parents' ability to buy a home depends on their financial capacity. Today there are also limitations. And in fact, with this agreement for some, there will be a higher degree of free choice, for if you live in the West with parents who have no opportunity to move an address, you will now have the opportunity to apply for a high school inside Copenhagen • an opportunity to both search and enter, which did not exist before.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125405	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125407	Let us get the facts straight: free elections are being restricted. Fewer students than before will meet their first priority with this deal. Those are the facts, and that is what the agreement says. Then I just have to understand whether this is the main argument of the Radical Left in order to further limit free choice of school, that it is already limited today. So, is it really a social liberal party's argument to say: we do not have a perfect free system today, and so it now gives us the right to make the system even more unfree? Is that really what the Radical Left is saying here today?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125445	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125446	No, it's by no means. The reason we're in this deal is because it solves real problems. These are problems addressed by the rapporteur himself in the past. We believe that the solution is necessary because it solves problems. It is true that it leads to a less free choice. What I am contesting is that today we have heard talk of forced distribution, as if it were something that has never existed before, as if it were something that the parties themselves did not want to see the majority of the parties criticising this agreement for making a distribution at all. We believe that a distribution is necessary and we can stand at the target of the allocation mechanism chosen here. If we had made it ourselves, we would have chosen someone else, but we can easily stand at the goal of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125526	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125530	Not so many years ago, a majority in the Folketing found that there were major problems in certain residential areas and decided to solve the problems based on the housing areas where the problems were. I mean, you got to where the problem was. If one had had the same approach to high school problems of this kind, where some colleges develop into a kind of parallel society for a particular ethnic group in Denmark, one would have said that one has to address the high schools where the problem is. Why didn't they do that? Why is it not good enough to address the problems of the gymnasium? Why does it have to be 100 percent? In Denmark, young people are involved in the fact that in some colleges there are problems with the composition of pupils, in the sense that they must then be forced to attend some colleges that they do not want to attend, to a much greater extent than today, where practical conditions limit access to the upper secondary school they would like to enter? Now it will be ideology and problem gymnasiums that put you into other high schools.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125636	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125637	Well, we're going with this deal exactly where the problems are. There is differentiation between those areas where there is no biased pupil composition and those where there is a biased pupil composition. So the areas where there are problems are addressed. I do not recognise that these are just a few problem gymnasiums and that there are only problems in those schools where we see an over-representation of pupils with other ethnic backgrounds. I also think it is a problem that you clash with other places with students who are similar to each other. I think we should go to school cross-country, and it is quite fair that the rapporteur wants a completely free and unregulated secondary school choice. I think that the rapporteur's party, together with the new citizens, is the only ones to do that, but that is quite fair. I believe that there is a need to resolve the problems and that is why we have chosen to be part of this agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125729	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125730	It's a tough broom anyway, this! In other words, it is not about the fact that there are too many immigrants in individual high schools; at least that is not just the problem. It is also about high schools up in North Zealand, for example. are too many children of well-functioning parents with good incomes. And that is also a problem. That is what the radical rapporteur says. They are also problem gymnasiums, and therefore it is justified that something has to be done about them and that they have to be moved around Denmark, because it is a problem that their parents are so well-functioning and have such high salaries that the students live in northern Zealand and go there with other students who look like them. It's unbelievable.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125811	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125811-2	That's not what I said either. So there are words in my mouth from the rapporteur. I believe that in the West, for example, this is a question of • and I would say that is indisputable if you have gone to high schools where the most privileged in that area crawl together and choose to be in those high schools because other high schools have gained a bad reputation in many cases undeserved. I'm not talking about high schools in North Zealand. The rapporteur puts that in my mouth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125838	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125842	Thank you so much. I think it is kind of paradoxical. We stand here in 2022 and the radical rapporteur stands up and gets upset: the Radical Left is now taking responsibility for resolving the problems. Yes, it would be very strange if it were not the Radical Left who took the lead in resolving the problems that the Radical Left has led to create with the totally misguided immigration policy, because that is why we are here today. That you then choose to destroy it for a great many well-functioning Danish children in that process, we are then some who think that is deeply unacceptable. But why does the Radical Left honestly believe that it is Danish young, well-functioning Danish young people who have to pay for the failed policy led by the Radical Left for decades?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125937	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407125938	We do not believe that it is the young people here who are the problem. So I do not recognise the rapporteur's premise. It is not a problem for young people with a different ethnic background to go to high school; it is a success story, but it is of course a problem if we see an overly biased composition of pupils, because then it will be difficult to make integration work. But no, it is not a problem that young people with other ethnic backgrounds are now going to high school. It doesn't matter what you do: if you don't go there, you're a liability to society, and you go there, but then there's a problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130008	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130009	It's very difficult for such a normal-thinking person to get into that radical cheese bell where you have some idea of how society works. I'll try anyway. What the rapporteur says is that there are no problems in this. The only problem is these high schools aren't mixed enough. No, the reason why we are seeing these problems in some of the immigrant gymnasiums is precisely that many of those who go there do not behave properly, and that is what we see repeatedly, as a consequence of the failed immigration policy led by the Radical Left. When will the Radical Left wake up?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130050	Thank you. The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130051	If the criterion of being a normal-thinking human being is that you see the individual with a different ethnic background in high school as a problem, then I have to say that we have got something far into this Parliament Hall, which we are also.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130106	The last to a brief remark is Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130107	Thank you. I have looked into the Radical Left's programme of principles, and it says with your color: "Each human being must have as much influence as possible on his own living conditions and society. Only those who have real influence can take real responsibility. Then I would like to hear from the rapporteur: does the young person really have an influence on this plan, which is where it says that only 84 per cent. In the future, priority will be given to this and where it is now 90 per cent.?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130150	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130151	Yeah.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130155	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130203	That was a short answer and a rather surprising answer. You know, you go from 90 percent. At 84%, it is still believed that there is full influence here. I'm speechless, I have to say. Radical Left says they are a liberal party. But where does the liberal lie in relation to someone moving around with the young people who pawns and place them where the state thinks it best? Well, it has nothing to do with what is in the Radical Left's programme of principles.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130228	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130229	Yes, and in fact I think it also says that we need training in order to be able to free ourselves. And that is why we also need high-quality education. This presupposes that we do not have A and B schools, and that is why it is necessary to make a distribution of pupils, as there are today, but with some other rules.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130249	There are no more brief comments, so we thank the rapporteur. And then we welcome the Minister for Children and Education. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407130302	Thank you for that and thank you for a very good debate. It has been going on for a long time, and it deserves the subject too, because it is important material that we are dealing with. It is also extremely difficult, and it is not easy to solve problems, and it reflects the history of this by its very nature, because it has been the case that, for years now, rectors, high school teachers and, incidentally, students have been asking us to do something about this situation. What we are talking about is that the high schools have become increasingly skewed, and they are on ethnicity, they are also on social composition, and the first has created definite parallel social conditions in a number of high schools in Denmark. What has been the very clear message, both from rectors and from high school teachers and from high school students, is that the options one has to choose from should be better, so that at each of the high schools there should be a more balanced composition of pupils, so that it was not two half-bad options one had to choose from, but were more really good opportunities. We have chosen to listen to that. I am very sorry that the Left in particular did not end up in this agreement, because that was really my expectation. Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby said in her ministerial period and now I quote: The ghetto schools we see today are bad for the individual student who does not meet Danish pupils, Danish norms and values, and that is bad for integration into our society, and therefore there is a need for political action. Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby also said at that time and now I quote again: I hope that the conciliation circle and the political parties will take part in the action so that we can have new rules for the distribution of high schools starting from the next school year. I fully agree with what Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby said at the time, and that is also the work that was set in motion from her hand, which is what we are doing now. After all, nothing happened on the part of the previous government, and the committee of experts that was set up then came up with various models, including district models, cluster models, both of which involve much more in the free choice than what we are talking about here. With the bill, we are then trying to take on board the challenges of a very biased pupil composition, and I would say that I really think that Mrs Alma Tynell, who is chairman of the Danish High School Students' Association, said very well in a debate post: that what was the challenge is that when you stand as a young person today, when you choose between high schools, you can either choose a high school where no one looks like you, or you can choose a high school where everyone looks like you. It has become so crooked in our large cities in Denmark, and that means that when we talk about free choice, and that it has to be up to the individual, I would say that the challenge is that the individual student cannot decide what the others decide, and that means that the development that has taken place, where you then have two half-bad choices instead of getting some schools that are all in balance, the individual student cannot influence, and that means that it leaves the individual student with two half-bad choices, instead of politically taking responsibility for the fact that they are actually good choices. Does it have a bearing on how many people are given their first priority? We have been around that many times in the Chamber today, but yes, it has, but it has, sir. Rasmus Stoklund tells about Herlev Gymnasium, is certainly also absolutely right. The same could be said of Frederiksberg Gymnasium, and the same could be said of a series of other high schools, namely that the population living in the immediate vicinity of the high schools does not want their young people to go there. The young people themselves do not want to do what they are looking for away from those high schools, otherwise they will go somewhere where nobody looks like them. If you go out to Herlev Gymnasium, the same applies to reverse signs. The two, three classes I was in were the same, namely that more than half of the students did not come from Herlev at all. They had gone there to be sure to go to school with some who looked like themselves, because the alternative was to get into a school where no one looked like them. This means that right now all the young people are trying to aim for how to go to a school where you are just about sure that there are some who look like you. I simply do not think that is the right choice to make for young people, and that is why I believe that the President of the Association of Danish High School students hits it quite precisely by saying that today is the choice, that is, between a high school where no one looks like one, or a high school where everyone looks like one. We could do a little better than that. That is exactly what both rectors and teachers and pupils have asked for, and that is also what we have tried to land a model for here. Are there any other models? Yes, there is. The challenge with every model is that there is a challenge with every model. The district model has the challenge of restricting the freedom of choice to a very large extent. On the other hand, it has the advantage that it is incredibly easy to understand. So depending on what you think is heavier, it is the consideration that the students move geographically in the larger cities to a very large extent, because they do. It is not the case that the students today choose the upper secondary school that is closest to them. So one can say, it is the consideration that pupils should be able to choose for themselves, which weighs the most, or is it the consideration that things are transparent. I think it is a dilemma, I think there is something that speaks for both, and I can also listen to some of the parenting reactions that are coming now, that in particular part of the parents think it would be better if it were transparent. But if you ask the young people, they have weighted the heavier, that there was free choice, that you can simply search for Amager, even if you live on Nørrebro or vice versa, i.e. that you can move across the city. Then I would say that I think there are a lot of straws in the debate, and I really think that is a little too bad, and I would like to come back to them. I think it is important to establish what kind of situation we are also in, because it is as if there are some parties that have completely forgotten what it was that was the reason why Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby said the things she did at the time about some challenges that have not been solved. We got a report from Viby Gymnasium, and I don't know if the blue parties that aren't in this deal remember. At that time, however, every single blue party was incredibly busy telling us that you would do everything you can about everything, and you have ended up not doing it. I have not heard the Left yet point to another model. I've heard sir. Ole Birk Olesen points to a model, but I strongly disagree with that model. I have heard new citizens point to a model, I totally disagree with that model, but I have heard that other models have been mentioned, and I think that is the right way to work politically, namely to put forward the proposals you have, then negotiate them and find solutions. I have heard both the Danish People's Party, and I have also heard Enhedslisten suggest models other than what we have ended up on, but who have then been willing to get into a negotiating room and find some ways to do it. Moreover, I have also heard an undertaking that if any of the mechanisms prove not to be working, we shall have to look at it again. Of course. It is also in the text of the agreement, and I think that is an important part of it when we change so much. I have not heard the Left make a single offer of what should happen instead. I've heard a lot about what you don't want. But let's go back to the report from Viby Gymnasium & HF. Spit, slap, bullying, assault, expelled students who refuse to stay away, a hierarchy with a dominant hard tone, facebook groups where revenge is planned on other students and a general insecure atmosphere. These were the conclusions of that report. And the Left has no idea how to avoid parallel societies-like trends in some of the schools in Denmark. We have chosen the model that we have made here, where we resort to going two ways. One is that there are some high schools that are being closed down and that is actually a response to the Conservative People's Party which I heard questioning why so much money needs to be spent on this. We're just spending about 140 million. kr. to close some high schools for one year so that you can phase out and start over on blank paper and create a new study environment. There is, of course, some contradiction in the fact that, on the one hand, we think it is a really big problem that we are spending some money here, but in the context of the solution proposed by the Conservative People's Party, namely to close some high schools, we should just be aware that it costs a great deal of money, and that is the money we have chosen to drop off in this agreement. I think that is quite contradictory. I miss hearing something from Conservative and Left. Now I understand, because it was part of what was going on in the Chamber today, that people, the New Civil and Liberal Alliance and the Left and the Conservatives, are starting to tie each other up to want to change this after an election. Yes, and I understand that there are two proposals from the New Civil and Liberal Alliance, but what do Conservatives and the Left really want? We have no answer to that. And I look forward to hearing what you want to hear, because I assume that the Left still believes that there is a problem, that there are parallel social trends in some schools in Denmark, and I simply do not think that we can be familiar with the fact that there are a number of pupils for whom it will be the only choice. Now we come to the part about free choice. Yes, there will be a distribution mechanism, and there is also today, and there was also in the time of the counties, there has always been. In the schools, the primary schools, we have school districts, but I think it is a very long way to go for high school pupils, who, after all, have a longer geographical scope because they are older than primary school pupils, and therefore I think that free choice is better served. But there is clearly a dilemma here, because if you just give everything freely, the bad option is to choose from, and I think that is a bad idea, and that is why you have to find a balance between being able on the one hand to express the satisfaction of the wishes you have but, on the other hand, to do so in a way that does not mean that all options will be bad. Then I have heard the Left say that it is appalling that your socio-economic conditions and your parents' income should mean something to where you go to high school. Well, now I don't really know where sir. Morten Dahlin lives there, but if you live in Copenhagen, where it is a huge problem with high school, then I should say that your parents' income has a great deal to do with where there is a likelihood of going to high school. Well, we're talking about that there's 5% around here. of non-profit housing at Vesterbro in Copenhagen, so if you want to go into Rysensteen Gymnasium, you have to pull a relatively large amount of millions out of your pocket in order to secure a condo. That is why I actually see it as a little bit awkward and actually get a little bit offended by it when the Left stands up here and makes it sound as if your parents' income doesn't matter in relation to your high school situation today, because of course it does. Well, that means everything when you have a distance model and we have a city that is as divided as it is today. So it is absolutely true that it falls from 90%. is 84 per cent. With the model that we are proposing here, it will also mean something in the future, in relation to whether you come in or not. It is true that it is going to be the case that we achieve a different balance in view of the fact that the high schools that exist are actually sustainable in terms of the composition of pupils and the wishes of pupils. But let's take a concrete example of some of those who actually get a greater freedom of choice in this model. For example, if you have grown up in Høje-Taastrup, there is no chance today of entering Rysensteen Gymnasium, for example, unless your parents can afford to buy a very expensive apartment inside Vesterbro in Copenhagen and you will therefore live so close to Rysensteen Gymnasium that you can be admitted there. That is what is real today, and that is to say, when we talk about 90%. of the pupils today are given their first priority in the current system, and that is the figure that falls to 84 per cent, so we must be in favour of it covering the fact that you know well as a student: if I come from High Taastrup and want to go to Rysensteen Gymnasium, then it means that I have Rysensteen as my first priority, that I go in line for my second priority, and since I know that there is no shadow of a chance because of the distance criterion, I do not even say what my first priority is. In other words, there is a huge amount of darkness because of the many people who really do not indicate what they want as their first priority, in other words for fear of falling behind in terms of their second priority. And part of it is so much about income. In fact, I think that we are trying to draw a picture of the fact that today's situation is that there is just free admission and free choice on all shelves, that there are no restrictions and that you do not have to scot at all for your parents' income. So you have to live a relatively privileged life if you believe that this is the case, because that is not the case. So I would say in relation to transport that I think that it will be a very bad picture when you make it sound like there will be just all sorts of things being thrown all sorts of places in here. In other words, the expectation is that the vast majority will have one of their first four priorities met, and then there is no reason why you should have more than an hour's drive away. So there is simply a limit to where one can be placed, and that means that the only ones who come more than an hour's drive away are those who have asked for it themselves. If you have taken the active choice that you would like to go to a high school in Odense, even if you live in Copenhagen, you can get more than an hour's drive away. But embedded in the model is not that you can be placed more than an hour's drive away. And within the hour limit, which is the same as today, it will be the case that you yourself indicate what four wishes you have, and then there is a small group for whom the model does not go up, and the regions will be required to decide whether they can nevertheless place the pupil on one of the four priorities they have had, and if that is not possible, then it will be at the upper secondary school closest to where they live. In the current model, that is exactly the way Mr. Rasmus Stoklund said earlier today that very many high school students do not go to the closest place because they cannot see themselves in the student composition that is there. And that is why the students in the big cities move around a lot to other high schools than those where they belong immediately. So the point of just concluding something about whether transport time is shorter or longer, I would be very careful.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407131814	Thank you. We have a number of brief comments to make. First, it's sir. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407131820	In his speech, the Minister makes the point that the chairman of the DGS, Alma Tynell Dragsted, who had lost his last name in the Minister's speech, supports this law. I am more concerned about what ordinary young people think about this law. That is why I think it is extremely regrettable that the Minister has been so clever to put into effect this law after the forthcoming parliamentary elections. After all, it must not enter into force until the first vintage in the summer of 2023, and one may wonder about it. It's really weird if you think this is such a good idea that you can't get the law to come into force in a whole year, but you have to spend two years trying to get it to come into force. But I would like to ask the Minister: is it possible that the high school students admitted next year are given two messages, on the one hand, that they are admitted to this high school according to the old rules, and, on the other hand, that if the new rules had entered into force, they would have received either a yes or a no and had instead been admitted to another high school so that people can go informed to the parliamentary elections in 2023 because they know from admission in 2022 how it had gone?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407131934	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407131935	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407131937	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407131940	I am sure that is possible, but I do not think that the Minister has the political will to do so, because then it will not be possible for the electorate in the parliamentary elections in January, February or March 2023 to know what the consequences of this bill are. If they were informed in 2022 that they could get this high school, but that if the new rules had already entered into force, they would instead have been offered to go to this second high school, then people would not vote blindly. And there would be some reason for the Minister to postpone this until 2023.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132016	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132017	It has been the professional assessment that it is not possible to build the algorithm and, by the way, to test it in such a short time, and even though it has been so optimistic in my ministry to say that it can be done from next year, it will be my assessment that we will see some of the same challenges as we saw when we were driving the metro in the first place. So I see it as optimistic quickly that it should be possible to implement that algorithm next year. It also coincides with the fact that my own children reach an age at which to apply to high school, which means that I am of the same age as a lot of people who are currently facing that choice, and I do not think that I totally misjudge it if I say that I think that most parents of children at that age have realised that the rules are being changed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132100	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132103	Thank you so much. Actually, I just want to hear the minister, quite frankly, from the platform in the Danish Parliament, about this thing with the forced distribution of high school students is the only place you're gonna start making a distribution model in this way. I mean, is there anywhere else that you want to start to force? Are we gonna do something in primary school? Are we going into something in the area of the elderly? Is there any other point in the Minister's view that here too we should start to impose sanctions?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132134	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132134-2	There are no parts of our society where this is not already the case. In other words, today's institutions have what is called the reference to places. The schools have what is called school districts. Long-term higher education and medium-term higher education, etc. You sort the students according to their average grade, and thus there are plenty of pupils there who do not get their first priority because they did not have a high enough average to get in. And I don't see it as forcing us across these sectors. But it is just to say that it is entirely customary that if there are too many children who would like to attend a particular kindergarten, in relation to the number of places, then the municipality sorts it out according to the rules laid down in the day-off area. School districts have been established. There you sit and change the districts to make it fit. Some lay down social criteria over the school districts. Others go very much to the macrons in relation to also getting a positive ethnic mix of pupils. And in universities it has typically always been grades that have been sorted or forced
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132249	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132250	Thank you for the super fine account of how the systems work today. As a schoolteacher, I am reasonably well aware of how it works in the school field. That is why I am also curious about the model that has been laid down over the high schools at this time, and whether the Minister could imagine that, in the field of primary school too, if there is a school that has, as the Minister says, a biased social composition, it could be a school in a ghetto area, for example or something else, that one would then start doing this social engineering art and forcefully distribute the pupils around to mix them more. Could the Minister imagine that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132330	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132331	It is actually completely incomprehensible that it is a teacher I am facing who is asking that question. For there is simply not one municipality in Denmark that does not. We have school districts. It is also statutory; it is part of the primary school law to have school districts. A school district is exactly that. And just as with the school districts, where parents have the opportunity to apply for permission for their child to attend another school, you do not have the right to enter, so there is also the right to apply for all high schools throughout Denmark in the field of secondary education with the rules we are making here. This does not mean that you have the right to enter, but you have the right to seek. So what's called social engineering art, if that's what it is, is also with school districts, because district school means that it's the only school you have the right to be admitted to. So it is actually more lenient in the field of high school than it is in the field of school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132421	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mr. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132424	Thank you to the Minister for the speech. The speech was not so much about the system that the Minister now wants to introduce, it was actually mostly about the Left. And I understand that, because from the point of view of the Minister's chair there is not so much to be proud of when you are going to cut thousands of young people's free school choices quite strongly. However, the Minister came to say one thing about the agreement itself, which I think was a little interesting, namely that the Minister believes that for most young people today there are two half-bad choices. Now the Minister would like to take political responsibility rather than make a good choice for young people. In this way, the Minister says, and that is what this whole system is calling for young people to make the wrong choice today, choosing what the Minister thinks is bad, and that is why there is a political need to go in and restrict the free choice, and that is what is being done by now targeting the children's parents' income. That is why I would just like to ask the Minister: should we not instead show some confidence in young people and say that they can decide for themselves where to go to school?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132532	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132533	In fact, I said that we should give them good choices, not that we should make the choice for them. I am absolutely confident that when the young people say that we are giving them half-bad choices and that they want better choices, but that they still want free choice and are allowed to point out where they are going, I think we should listen to them. That's why I've rejected the district models. Had the district models been introduced, which both Enhedslisten and Dansk Folkeparti were in favour of, it would have meant that we made choices for the young people. I don't think we should go there. I think that is going too far in that direction. I think it is a very good idea for us to ensure that the composition of pupils has a proper balance at all high schools in Denmark, but that we are, of course, based on the fact that if the young person indicates that it is the four high schools he prefers to go to, that is what we start from when we distribute them. I think that is one way to strike a balance between the two. And then I just don't recognize the fact that it wasn't meant to mean anything by parents' income today. I would recommend that the rapporteur take a trip on the property side.dk and see what the price-rent on Vesterbro is, and then we can discuss again whether everyone can afford to move in next to Rysensteen Gymnasium.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132639	Sir. Morten Dahlin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132640	The fact is that the Minister is setting up a system in which young people are given less freedom of choice than today, because young people today are mischoosing. They are wrong to choose because their choice is not in line with the Minister's ideology. That is why the Minister is now setting up a system whereby, for the first time in Danish history, young people are divided into categories, not according to what they have done, not according to what they have provided themselves, but according to what their parents earn. I would therefore really like to ask the Minister whether it is in line with the social democratic principle on the Social Democratic website that there should be equal access to education regardless of father's or mother's purse.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132721	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132722	Sir. Morten Dahlin says the young people make the wrong choices. I simply disagree entirely with that. I believe that we have taken a political responsibility to create bad choices for young people, not to understand that the choice that young people make is bad, but that the choices they have are bad. We have created a system where, as a young person, you can either choose to go to a high school where everyone looks like you, or go to a high school where nobody looks like you. That part of the equation is a political responsibility. We have done extremely badly. But when the young people then make a choice as to whether they want to go somewhere where no one looks like one or where everyone looks like one, I am convinced that they are better at doing it than we would be from in here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132802	Then there is a brief comment on Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132807	Thank you for that and thank you to the Minister. I'd like us to come up with something about well-being. The Minister has not touched on this and I know that it is actually something that concerns the Minister. That's why I think it might be exciting just to touch it. When Professor emeritus Niels Egelund says that this thing about forcing someone in certain places is going to increase dissatisfaction and rootlessness, how has it been in relation to the considerations the Minister has made about this model?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132840	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407132841	That particular article came after we made the deal, but that doesn't mean that the rest of us haven't thought the idea. Well, I think it's extremely dilemmaous to have to go in and look at this area. It is partly because I believe that it is also problematic in relation to the well-being of young people that they will either go to a school where nobody looks like one or where everyone looks like one. I believe that we, as people, work best and, by the way, we also best become whole citizens, so to speak, if we meet a wide range of people. So this thing about making such monocultures in schools, I just don't think it's good for young people, for their well-being and for their learning, for being part of society. I think that damages their well-being. On the other hand, it is clear, and that is why we in the Social Democratic Party have not wanted to be involved in creating a model for the district that if we do not take into account that some people also have some wishes in relation to where they want to go in high school, then we go too far in a different direction; I think we do. And those considerations need to be balanced. In other words, the tenders that are available must be sound. The current model cannot deliver that today. The new one can. And then young people should be able to indicate where they prefer to go, and there would be a district model that would mean that it was only one place to go. That is where we have set out that you are actually allowed to choose, and that will be what will be the governing body of the model; it will be your own choice. However, that does not mean that there is free admission.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133004	Mrs. Gitte Willumsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133005	The thing about wishes is interesting, because you have to want more in this model. Now four requests have to be made where, as I remember, it was two. You can just turn up the number of wishes, and so at some point you will be able to say that everyone has got their wish because you had infinite desires; so that as a future student you would have to sign up at some high school. So has it not been tried in the model to pretend that the students would be able to meet their wishes by just turning up the number of wishes? Well, I've also been involved in making models like this in a public school where we should have something to go up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133047	Thank you. The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133048	No, no, no, no, no, no. I have no problem standing up for the balance we have found here. The 84%. are not those who get one of their first four wishes. The 84%. are actually the ones who get their wish number one. In other words, we are getting considerably closer to 100 per cent if we are talking about how many of their first four wishes are met. But I think it has been fair to say that this is the assessment; it is the 84 per cent that have been granted their first wish. I don't think there's any reason to do talmagic. I think there are too many strawmen in advance about what may or may not happen to the new model. So I think it is important that the facts are presented in this way, and then there is just huge uncertainty associated with that figure. I think that is also one of the problems in the discussion of figures, because we do not know what the search patterns will be in the new model.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133132	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment on Mrs Anne Honoré Østergaard from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133137	Thank you. I heard the Minister say in his speech that young people would prefer to go with someone who looks like them, and I could understand that they should not. At any rate, the Minister expressed some concern and said that they should not necessarily do so, and so we should also help them to get to know people other than those who look like themselves. Here you use the expression to help some, some might use the word coercion, but leave it alone. I do not think Mrs Mette Thiesen really got an answer to her question as to whether there are places where we should help young people, in other words children and young people, more than we do today, so that they make friends other than those who look like them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133230	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133230-2	No, who people are friends with and aren't friends with, I think it's kind of a private matter. I do not think we should get involved in this politically.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133238	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133239	Okay, so let me try to ask you another way. Should they get to know others more than they do today? Should something happen either in primary school, in the care area or elsewhere, according to what you have just imagined? Would the Minister also like to touch on some of the models that lie today, so that children and young people will meet someone who looks a little bit less like themselves?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133307	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133308	On the part of the Social Democrats, we have a wish that by 2030 we should have a situation in which we do not have such a large proportion of schools and educational establishments where the percentage of immigrants is over 50. We have a clear desire for this, and we really want to do less than 30%, and I think it is a good thing that we can discuss whether it is too many. For social democracy, it is vitally important that we do not create parallel societies. Then it can be said that where the rules have been the worst in terms of this is, after all, in the field of high school, because in the field of school we have school districts. Then not all municipalities in the school districts have achieved the goal of distributing pupils in a way that does not create parallel societies. That's where I think you should go further. But it's just to say that in high school, you just let it go completely. Apparently, the former blue government didn't give a shit about us getting so high school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133404	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. As no more of you have asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Children's and Education, and if none of you object, I consider it adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133439	The debate is open. The first person to speak is Mr Seligman. Rasmus Stoklund from Social Democracy. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133452	Thank you. We are now going to deal with a legislative proposal that is part of the agreement on more urban and rural life that was concluded back in the autumn. I welcome the fact that all parties in the Folketing are included in the agreement. It agrees with Parliament, which will now ensure that the city centers again become a local gathering point and meeting point. The bill contains two parts. The first part concerns support for the urban centres of small and medium-sized towns. The second part is that municipalities are allowed to rent so-called settlement houses. It is sad when you walk in what was once lively city centres, but where both streets and rooms are now empty. Unfortunately, development has been going on for many years, and especially during the corona crisis, life in the city centers has had a difficult time. It has therefore been necessary to make a targeted effort if shop deaths and settlements are not to continue. This bill will help with that. In particular, the agreement provides for the allocation of EUR 180 million. kr. to a pool for the renewal of urban centres in small and medium-sized cities that municipalities can apply for. With the bill, the municipalities are given a quite free framework for how they will rethink and renew the city centres, which is sensible. It can be very different what the individual city centre needs. The second part of the bill is about the municipal rental of real estate. Today, it is not legal for municipalities to rent real estate in order to attract newcomers. If the municipalities are to have the opportunity to do so, it could be as part of the municipality's overall settlement strategy.There is a need to create a legal home for it. This is what we do with this bill. In this way, potential settlers can test for a limited period of time what it's like to live in the municipality before deciding to move permanently. It makes good sense, especially in small communities. We think this is a good bill and the Social Democrats support it. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133641	You're welcome, sir. Rasmus Stoklund. There are no brief comments, so we are moving on to Mr. Peter Juel-Jensen from the Left, Danish Liberal Party. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133655	Thank you for that, President. The bill translates parts of an agreement on more life in our city centres and rural areas from 29 November 2021 between all parties here in the Folketing. In the Left, we very much welcome the support for the initiatives that can help make our rural areas even more attractive. But this agreement does not only do it for our rural areas. Yes, it is a loving hand in the back, but there must be quite different initiatives, both in the area of infrastructure in terms of planning law, in our education area and in relation to equalisation and many other factors, if it is to really affect rural development. In addition, the draft law also provides for the possibility of establishing so-called "residual residences'. We are also very much in favour of this. The left is a party to the agreement, and we stand by that. We are not in line with the development of our rural areas, but we are a bit off the road with this agreement. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133753	You're welcome, sir. Peter Juel-Jensen. There are no brief comments and I would like to welcome Mrs Ina Strøder-Schmidt from the Socialist People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407133803	Thank you for the floor. As the rapporteur is unable to be here today, I shall give her rapporteur's speech. Today we are discussing a bill which translates parts of the agreement on more life in urban and rural areas into a political agreement of which SF is a part, and that is why we support the proposal, but we would still like to say a few words on the matter. First of all, I would like to say that money is being set aside for small and medium-sized towns where city centres have been worn out and characterised by shop deaths. Many times it is a result of the fact that cities have gone from being a main city before the municipal reform to being a centre city. These cities can now appear worn out and empty. In the SF we are pleased that funds are being set aside to give the city centers a facelift. The funds can help to restore the city centres and make them attractive, so that there can be a local gathering point and meeting point again. At the same time, the city centers can be used to add new functions to the city by e.g. to set up local welfare centres, a proposal that both SF and S toured with before and during the last parliamentary election campaign. The welfare centres create proximity and can support urban life. It is important for SF that the content of the welfare centres is derived from the local needs of a city. It may be that the city needs a citizens' center, a cultural school, a library or something fourth. We look forward to seeing whether there are municipalities that will seize the opportunity to restore development in these areas, of course, in proper cooperation with the cities. In SF we are particularly pleased with the part of the bill which is about making it legal for municipalities to rent settlement houses. The initiative in the legislative proposal comes from a motion for a resolution tabled by the SF at the beginning of 2021, and we welcome the support. Municipalities and municipalities must be able to rent settlement houses at market conditions for a limited period of time to those who would like to test their lives in the city. The idea is that it will attract potential settlers that they can rent a settlement house for 3-4 months and look at the area. The settlement houses provide an opportunity to get a taste for rural life or on one of Denmark's fantastic islands. The municipalities that have tried with settlement houses have positive experiences, which is why we in the SF are proud that with this bill we ensure legal basis in the law for the rental of settlement houses. In the SF, we are pleased to be part of the agreement, which helps to ensure life and development in rural areas. Today's draft law takes a step along the way and we look forward to discussing several parts of the agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134040	Thank you to Mrs Ina Strjer-Schmidt. There are no brief comments. That is why I would like to welcome Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134053	Thank you very much, President. The agreement with the government, which also includes Radicals, means that 180 million will be set aside. kr. Total for the period 2022 to 2027. Those funds are used for the renewal of urban centres and the location of local welfare centres, as has also been mentioned. The funds will be allocated to applicant municipalities on the basis of a number of objective criteria and 40% will be required. Local co-financing It must therefore be possible to carry out area renewal in urban centres with between 4 000 and 20.000 inhabitants. The bill contains two additional parts: welfare centres and settlement houses. The aid must also be used to create welfare centres located in the centre of the city. It is intended that the municipalities should decide for themselves which functions are appropriately located in the welfare centre. Features of a local welfare centre can e.g. be citizens' services, dentists, doctors, centres of activity, offers for the elderly, cultural school, libraries etc. The aid may be used for the relocation or creation of welfare functions, prior analysis and development work, installations, renovation, etc. We know, of course, that with the municipal reform there can be a long way to the town hall, especially since bus services are still in some places geared to the old municipal boundaries, and therefore it can be almost impossible to operate a bus from one city to another within the municipality. In addition, as mentioned above, it also provides for the establishment of so-called settlement houses. A number of smaller municipalities face challenges in attracting citizens to the municipality. Against this background, a municipality has established and operated a so-called settlement house with which the municipality has leased real estate for a limited period of 3 or 4 months as an attempt to attract potential settlers. The municipality has experienced success with the scheme and that scheme is now extended to other municipalities which have similar needs. So in those words, Radicals can support the bill. However, I would like to conclude by saying that I look forward to hearing something. It may be that the Minister will perhaps elaborate a little more on the part of the bill which provides for leases to be rented on market terms. At the same time, it appears elsewhere that no profit is made. I think that may seem a bit contradictory from an immediate point of view, but there is probably a very good explanation for it. Thank you very much.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134346	You're welcome. There are no brief comments, so we move on to Mr. Henning Hylllested from Enhedslisten ▪ De Red-Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134357	Thank you. After all, the rapporteurs have explained very well the content of the proposal to date. That is the advantage of getting a little down in the line of speeches, because then you're free to list all the good things it contains. Because we actually think it is a good legislative proposal that we can, of course, endorse. After all, we are part of the agreement on which the proposal is based, and we think that there are some very good things in the draft law here. And this is not least the issue of the renewal of these city centres, which is what this is all about, and the opportunities it offers to some municipalities, but especially the municipal permission to rent these settlement houses as an offer to some people who might be interested. This is, of course, particularly aimed at rural areas and perhaps especially the small islands around them. It has been a great wish from many of the places that you got that opportunity. It has been lacking in many places. And it is clear that it can be a huge decision to move to a rural area and perhaps to a small island, and that is why we think it is very good if the opportunity is made available that one can just try it out of how is it with the longer distances, the completely different environment, the new neighbours etc. So we think it's really good. I also note that the criteria for the distribution of funds are laid down in a notice, but I also see that the rapporteurs will be involved in setting objective criteria for the distribution of funds. And then I would venture to claim that it is in good hands, because then it is in our hands. So we certainly think that is good too. One might always ask whether this is enough to strengthen rural development and the small islands, etc. No, of course it isn't, because this is just part of a bigger whole. It takes a lot of action. We need better accessibility in terms of better public transport and flex traffic, and what do I know? There are a great many things that need to be done to strengthen rural development. So of course this is not enough in itself, but it is certainly part of a development that we would like to contribute to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134630	Thank you, sir. Henning Hylllested. There are no brief remarks to him. I would like to welcome Mrs Gitte Willumsen from Silkeborg and the Conservative People's Party. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134644	Thank you. Silkeborg is a great place. Today we are discussing a draft law amending the law on urban renewal and urban development and the law on housing. The bill translates parts of an agreement on more life in the city centres and rural areas from November 2021. We Conservatives were in the agreement, and that is why it may not surprise anyone that we are really happy about this bill and look forward to the further work on it. We have a challenge in Denmark. In some places, the small shops close, and the city centers will stand empty and look ghostlike. When the city looks empty, it becomes harder to fill up the school, and it will also be difficult to put a U-8 football team in the local sports association. That is why we must actively support the city centres when there is no longer a trading life as there was before, with new and other facilities and offers. With this bill, we are allowing small and medium-sized towns, where the city centre is characterised by shop deaths, to reunite again: some meeting places and gathering points. Hopefully, it can help create life in new ways. And precisely communities are important; they can prevent loneliness and misfortune, which we unfortunately see far too much among our young and older fellow citizens. The bill also makes it possible to bring the city centres and rural areas to life by operating the so-called settlement houses. We believe that on top of the covid-19 there are more who have become interested in getting out, where there is more air, and where you are closer to nature. But that is a big step to take. So the fact that you get the chance to try the dream off without risking your private economy, we believe. We're ready to test the various actions that this bill is proposing. We look forward to it being able to work. This deserves our smaller towns and rural areas. So the Conservative People's Party can support the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134908	Thank you to Mrs Gitte Willumsen. There are no brief comments. Welcome to sir. Alex Ahrendtsen from the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407134917	Thank you, President. The Danish People's Party is included in the agreement and of course also votes in favour of the bill when it reaches third reading. We are pleased that this great amount of money has been set aside to strengthen the city centres of small towns, and we are also pleased with the settlement opportunities which the municipalities are now getting permanent. I shall not repeat the many good arguments put forward by my honourable colleagues in this Chamber. However, I have one small thing: the modern technology and Internet commerce have made a big dent in the retail trade. It will not remedy that, but it will certainly allow the municipalities to create a little more life in the cities concerned, and we continue to support that. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135006	Thank you for that, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen. Welcome to sir. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135011	Thank you. The Liberal Alliance is in favour of the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135021	It was brief and clear. Thank you. We have now come to the Minister for Home Affairs and Housing, if he would like to enter the platform. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135037	I would like to start by apologizing to the President for being indisposed. It was about a game of Mario Kart that I have had with the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party here recently. I won't tell you who won. I would like to start by thanking you for your comments. We are implementing the agreement we made last year on 29 November to support more life in small and medium-sized towns. I think it was the then Chairman of the Group of the Left who said that when we had a headline that sounded more life in city centres and rural areas, we should instead use the wording a little. After all, that's not entirely wrong either. We are well aware of that, I think that everyone who is in this agreement is not that now there are major upheavals in the whole way people live and live. But we think it is a step in the right direction. We know that there are many who are struggling with people moving out of the city centre and closing shops because we are acting in a different way. This is done both in small towns and, of course, in large cities. We have then said that we are going to set aside 180 million. kr. for the renewal of the city centres and the establishment of local welfare centres. We have made it so that the bill allows it to be laid down in a decree. We agree to allocate 130 million. kr. to a pilot scheme to help ten selected city centres, and then we have given a separate opportunity to rural and island municipalities to rent settlement houses to attract newcomers. It allows to rent for a period of 3-12 months. I hope that this proposal will help to strengthen the city centres where there are falling population and shops closing, and at the same time it will also make it possible to do so, for example. The islands are given the opportunity to attract citizens. So we look forward to the committee reading.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135241	Thank you. There are no brief comments. No one else has asked to speak, so the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Home Affairs and Housing Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135311	The negotiations have been opened and the first to speak is the Minister for Home Affairs and Housing. Once again, welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135327	In the resolution we are now considering, the government is required by the end of the year to ensure wider possibilities for municipalities to assign housing to residential residents in private rentals. This corresponds to the full content of the government proposal we made last March on mixed residential areas, which was a follow-up to the parallel community package from 2018. The parallel society package itself has a broad majority behind it, and it can be said that the core or such large part of our proposal last year was about introducing prevention areas. In this context, it was proposed to extend the stricter requirements for municipal counselling to residential residents in vulnerable residential areas to include the provision of counselling for vacant housing in prevention areas. We were therefore looking at how to extend the possibility for municipalities to assign housing to citizens who cannot be assigned housing in a exposed residential area or a prevention area because of the stricter authorising rules. In general, we think it is important to ensure that local authorities do not only take part in the general sector. The private landlords also believe we can take a housing social responsibility if we want to prevent a social division between different districts and settlements and ensure a varied housing mix, where the strong can also help lift those who are not as strong. In order to solve our housing social problems, we need a joint effort, and this was why we proposed to strengthen the municipal authority's authorising right for housing in private rental properties. The proposal was to ensure that all owners of private rental property with 20 or more leases under the municipal council's provision should make available to the municipal council one in ten vacant leases, and this was to be applied in municipalities with vulnerable residential areas or prevention areas. However, the political negotiations on the basis of the proposal showed that there was no majority in favour of such an authorising system. However, the negotiations also showed that the entire contract circle agrees that the possibility of the municipal council also has to allow private rental property to be included if they are voluntary arrangements. At the same time, private landlords have indicated that they would like to contribute to the municipalities being given better opportunities to assign housing to private rentals as long as this is done voluntarily. We therefore agreed to adjust the voluntary scheme and to allow private landlords and municipalities to agree that the municipalities have the right to authorise private rental property. The adjustment means that the possibility of concluding voluntary agreements on counselling with private landlords wishing to make apartments available to the municipality for the purpose of solving housing social tasks is applicable in all municipalities. The six-year time limit for the agreement has now been abolished in order to allow the parties to agree on the duration of the authorising court. It has also been agreed that an evaluation of the adjusted voluntary scheme will be carried out in 2025 to see if it is working properly. I think this is a fine solution which we have come up with together, and it is my feeling that private landlords are willing to make a contribution to solving housing social problems. If, in three years' time, the evaluation shows that private landlords have failed to meet the expectations of the contract circle, then we will consider what initiatives are needed. I can only confirm that the government stands by the agreement reached last June, including the part relating to authorising law, and that is why we cannot support the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135653	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135656	The Enhedslisten wants to help the government to improve housing policy, and that is why we are tabling this motion for a resolution that we can better get our policy through in the Folketing. And I think that there is a certain logic in the proposal made by the government. It is not because we support the need to limit such things, for example. the possibility for pensioners to move into such a prevention area. But if you then take a right from some people, it is also reasonable to give them the opportunity to settle elsewhere. And that is where the instruction for the private rental stock makes sense. Because we are also faced with the fact that there are some who are written up for certain housing associations because the rent is low. So I think we have an obligation to try to help those people. So the agreement has not reached that, so we stand by the fact that there are some people who have been given limited opportunities to move into some residential areas, and it can also be Danish pensioners. Can the Minister not see that it is not reasonable that this population should not have been given an extra opportunity by restricting their opportunities?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135803	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135804	I am quite sure that pensioners do not count in relation to what is called flexible rental, which is compulsory in areas of prevention. In other words, what matters in relation to that part is whether you are in employment or in education when you are at the age when you can be in employment or in education. That is why this does not apply to the specific example, but it can of course apply to another example. It may apply to a person who is unemployed, or to a person who is an early retirement or some other thing, that you get in the back of the queue. And, of course, in areas where there is a high demand for cheap housing, there will be fewer opportunities for the individual, and I think that there should be an opportunity to point out. Especially in the City of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, where there are a lot of old rentals, which also have a relatively low rent, I think it would be very good. As I have said, our proposal on the part of the government was that there should be a right to direct local authorities to private housing, but now we are trying to have a voluntary scheme.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135912	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135913	The fact that the municipality could have a right to assign one in ten dwellings to larger rentals in the municipalities where there are prevention areas, I think there was, in fact, a certain logic and balance in that. We have not achieved this until now. Now the Minister says that there will be an evaluation in 2025 of the voluntary arrangements for accessing some private rentals. Does the Minister have an assessment at this stage of whether that agreement has had any effect on this matter so far? It has been legal in the past to make such voluntary agreements without having any effect. Why does the minister think it should have an effect now?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135953	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407135954	The first reason I believe this is that we have a great lack of housing. The municipal instruction which can be used is also used, for example. in the City of Copenhagen to a large extent, while, for example, in the city of Copenhagen to a large extent. in many Jutland municipalities do not use the 25 per cent. instructions you have. So the need is greater than it has been the last time they tried, which was in 1996, as far as I remember. There were simply more cheap homes then, so I think that's the difference compared to today. And then I would just like to say quite basically: there is not a majority in the Folketing to make the arrangement we are proposing and with which Enhedslisten agrees. Now we are trying to find another solution, and then we hope we can get somewhere along the way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140034	Thank you for that to the Minister. There are no more brief comments, so we shall move on to Mr Beazley's report. Rasmus Stoklund, rapporteur for the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140047	Thank you. With B 82, Enhedslisten proposes to ensure extended opportunities for municipalities to assign residential residents to residential buildings in private rental properties. In the Social Democratic Party, we, like the Enhedslisten, believe that it is important that we, on the political side, secure mixed urban and residential areas. It is essential that we live together across ethnic origins, levels of education and income. However, there was no majority in favour of the proposal during the negotiations. Despite the fact that we did not reach the goal of our own original proposal to be able to direct housing seekers to housing in private rentals, we believe that we ended up with a good result in the agreement anyway. We are extending the voluntary scheme with the agreement; here the previous limitation of 6 years has been lifted and private landlords and their interest groups have announced that they are ready to take responsibility. For social democracy, it is important that we ensure equal opportunities for all children in Denmark wherever they grow up, and therefore it is also important that we live more mixed in residential areas. This is crucial for supporting our social model, for integration and for ensuring equal opportunities for all children. Social democracy does not support the resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140159	Thank you, sir. Rasmus Stoklund. There are no brief comments. And then we would like to have a Bornholmer on the platform, Mr. Peter Juel-Jensen from the Left, Danish Liberal Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140221	Thank you for that, President. And thank you for the floor. First of all, I would like to welcome Mrs Heidi Bank, the rapporteur on housing, who unfortunately was unable to be present at this point. But, of course, I have promised to convey the position of the Left on this proposal. The motion for a resolution from the Enhedslisten, which we are discussing here today, was originally part of the government's proposal...Mixed residential areas... the next step in the fight against parallel societies... and this original element ended up not being part of the final agreement. You know where you've been in this case, and we are entirely behind the agreement that we helped to make with the government, the Conservatives, the Danish People's Party, the Socialist People's Party and the Liberal Alliance back in 2021. The Left cannot support the motion for a resolution tabled by the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140311	Thank you, sir. Peter Juel-Jensen. No one wanted to get on with short remarks. And we move on to Mrs Halime Oguz of the Socialist People's Party. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140324	Thank you for that, President. Today we are going to consider the Enhedslisten's proposal to extend the scheme to ensure municipal authorising rights for private rental properties. In SF we would like to acknowledge Enhedslisten's commitment to this, because it is important and quite natural that the private housing sector also takes responsibility for a Denmark in balance, a Denmark without parallel societies. Because we know that we will have better integration when we take action against parallel societies. In SF we want a coherent country where people from different backgrounds live side by side. Therefore, it is important that we provide municipalities with the best framework for creating a wider housing mix, which requires people to be assigned differently than they did in the past, so that they in jobs are settled in prevention areas and that those without jobs are assigned to housing outside prevention areas. And here we believe in SF that it should be possible for municipal councils to refer to large private properties. Exactly this was also one of the things that we in the SF fought for in last year's negotiations on the prevention agreement. Unfortunately, the right wing fought against it and we ended up in a compromise. This meant that the existing possibilities for municipal direction for private rental properties were extended on a voluntary basis. The scheme will have to be evaluated in due course, and in SF we would like to see whether the content of that agreement will work as intended. If not, we will have to open up the negotiations again. Against this background, I would like to say that the SF cannot support this resolution at this stage, although it is an excellent proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140512	You're welcome. There are no brief remarks to Mrs Halime Oguz. We therefore move on to Mrs Susan Kronborg from the Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140526	Thank you, President. The motion for a resolution from the Enhedslisten wants a more robust approach to the municipal authorising right of private landlords than the recent extension of the authorising right, which was adopted by L 23. Bill L 23, the so-called extension of the ghetto package, was, of course, radically opposed, but Radicals were in favour of the part which was concerned with increasing the possibility of municipal authorizing of private rental properties. So here is a comment on L 23 and then I will comment on the Enhedslisten's proposal. It was proposed by L 23 that municipal authorizing law be extended to all municipalities, not only municipalities with residential areas with at least 1,000 inhabitants. Thus, at L 23, there will be an extension of the facilities available at the time for local authorities to provide private rental accommodation. After the adoption of L 23, all municipalities will be able to conclude voluntary agreements with private landlords who wish to make part of their apartments available to the municipal council for the purpose of solving housing social tasks, while municipalities and private landlords can enter into agreements as long as there is mutual interest in this. Radicals considered that the Government's proposal to increase the possibility of municipal authorizing rights in private rental properties was and is a necessary consequence so that the housing social task could be solved more easily. However, we pointed out in the discussion of L 23 that the housing social effort must follow. Radicals, therefore, obviously did not vote in favour of extending the ghetto package and could not separate the part which was concerned with increasing the possibility of municipal authorizing law by voluntary agreement with private rental properties. If we turn to the present motion for a resolution, it is not about voluntary agreements, so on the basis of which Radicals cannot support the proposal from the Enhedslisten. The private sector is happy to help, my impression is, because of course the private sector must take its share of the social problems in society, but this must be done on a voluntary basis. The private sector is very much taking its share already, insofar as the Danish rental sector is one of the most regulated in the world and very artificially cheap housing is provided. So in this way the private sector contributes a great deal. In these words, in Radical terms, we must commend the intention, but we do not support the proposal from the Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140807	Thank you to Mrs Susan Kronborg. Then I would like to welcome Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407140824	Thank you to Enhedslisten for having tabled this motion for a resolution, in which you wish to give the municipalities the opportunity to designate housing in private rentals. This proposal clearly shows a difference between socialists and conservatives, so now you have some ideological speech. I once heard Per Clausen, Enhedslisten, in a political debate held in the Silkeborg Halls, as they were then called. The debate dealt with several issues, and of course the discussion also affected tax and work. Here he said, and I quote after my memory, but I remember clearly: Your money? Nah, that's our money. This motion for a resolution has exactly the same approach to mine. When something is owned by a person, it belongs to that person and not to others, even to the public. How the owner of the property wants to manage his property, we will not interfere. He can use it himself, rent it out and make money on it or sell it. That's up to you. At least that's what it's like to be conservative. When this motion for a resolution suggests to private individuals, I cannot refrain from looking up the word privately in the dictionary, and it says: 'which is not owned or operated by the public but by one or more individuals, an organization, an association or the like. That was the explanation that was at the top of the page of the dictionary. I could have brought more, but now I just chose to read the first one. As a Conservative, we cannot support this motion for a resolution. Private is private. The public sector must not have access to private property. Agreements and contracts can be drawn up where both are agreed and one is equal, but that is not what this motion for a resolution proposes. So, on behalf of the Conservative Group, I would like to say that we cannot support the proposal, and I should like to welcome the Danish People's Party and say that they cannot support the proposal either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141108	Thank you to Mrs Gitte Willumsen. There are a few brief comments and the first is from Mrs Halime Oguz.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141116	Thank you. I would just like to ask the rapporteur a question as to whether the Conservative People's Party is in favour of having a society based on good values and that, in this context, we also need to ensure that we can maintain coherence. How does the Conservative People's Party agree with that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141143	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141144	Well, we are also interested in having a good society in every way possible. For us, it is possible to manage the planning work in the municipalities, and it is the municipalities that are responsible for having a proper housing policy on the ground.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141205	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141206	If we are to ensure a good, sustainable society, is it not important that everyone, like everyone, contributes to it? I simply cannot understand why we want to combat parallel societies while at the same time seeking to preserve the private housing market. I just don't think that makes any sense. It must be the case that everyone must somehow contribute to the fact that we have the Denmark that we know, namely a Denmark that is based on sound values, where everyone knows each other and knows each other and we do not have socially fragmented areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141245	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141247	Well, we can easily get mixed communities without taking private property from people. Well, it's not like we're gonna have a more equal society by moving somebody with a low income into a home somewhere owned by Mr. Pedersen. We get that by making smart planning out in the municipalities. That's where we move on this agenda.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141312	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141314	Well, it is a good thing that the rapporteur listens to Per Clausen. I can only recommend that. We can always learn more from that, but I do not think the Conservative rapporteur has fully achieved it and perhaps has not listened enough to Per Clausen yet. It is the case that many parties argue that we have to have such mixed towns and mixed residential areas, but if it is only the general housing areas that have to accept people in urgent need of housing, then there are some places where they come to believe that they are carrying out equally many social tasks. And that is why it would be very sensible to come to the conclusion that the municipality also has more opportunities to point people to housing. Because it can be someone who, for example. have been divorced and where there is a need to find a home where children can go to the same primary school, and that is why it is perhaps a limited geographical area to which it would be reasonable to point. And there it isn't always possible to find a housing association that's right there. So does the rapporteur not see that it would actually be sensible to have more tools in the municipality to be able to designate housing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141423	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141424	Yeah, and it's fine if you can make a voluntary deal with a property owner. We're all in on that. I have to say that I myself am in the municipality of Silkeborg, where we have worked actively to make rentals around the whole municipality. It has not always been well-known, but I stood for it every time, compared to that we also had to have general housing places in the municipality where there were several well-off citizens. And, as the rapporteur says, you can divorce and stand in a housing situation which makes it nice to be able to move into a general home so that children can stay in the local school. We fully admit that, but to go in and seize people's private property we cannot be a part of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141508	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141510	This isn't about confiscating. It is a question of helping some private landlords to rent out their homes, and that is what it would be like if the municipality had an authorising right for every ten homes. And then I would like to congratulate Silkeborg Municipality for its housing policy. I think it is remarkable that small sections of general housing have been chosen, even in smaller urban communities such as the United Kingdom. Kragelund, where there are 1,000 inhabitants. It actually has a positive influence on moving patterns, etc., so I would really like to encourage others to look at Silkeborg's housing policy right in that area, because I think it is actually remarkable that the priority is to provide general housing for many smaller urban communities.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141551	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141553	Thank you for praising the housing policy in my own village. I have been active in it as far back as 20 years ago when we fought to get some more general housing for the city I lived in, because we could see there was a problem when there were divorces and other things in people's lives, it made the housing situation difficult so that you could become local. So we are totally in favour of this. But to go in and tell a private owner that now you have to give a home, because the municipality would like to have it, we simply cannot agree to it. You can make voluntary agreements • always and we think that is a very good idea, and I believe that many people know that, and I am sure that if private people cannot rent out their homes, then they are probably also a little more helpful. So it's gonna be okay. I think market forces are gonna solve this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141643	Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141644	Thank you. Does the rapporteur not agree with me that it is a slightly different parliament that we have today? Well, this isn't the first time we've talked about coercion. Earlier in the day, we were going to have to distribute high school students, and now we're going to have to decide where to take your high school exam, and then park the free choice completely away. Now we're going to have to force someone to rent out their homes. These are some who earn their money basically from renting out homes and now have to force them to rent out their homes and give others the right to dispose of their homes. Imagine if the minority gets through with this, that you have to be forced to rent 10%. of its homes out through the municipality. What if, as a home owner, you have made an agreement with your municipality that you set 30 per cent. available? Then this proposal can actually help to ensure that we have fewer homes available for those who need it. Does the rapporteur agree that coercion is wrong, including in this case?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141740	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141742	I totally agree. Now I have been sitting on the last issues in this Chamber talking about coercion all day long, and it is tiring, I think, we have a Parliament that is so committed to governing and imposing on citizens how to live their lives. We are fundamentally opposed to this, and I know that this is where we, these two bourgeois parties, totally share our views. And I hope we can get more power over that at some point, so we don't have to keep talking forced all the time in this hall.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141817	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141818	I don't have a follow-up question. I am just delighted that there are two of us in this Chamber who pay tribute to the fact that we have personal freedom.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141828	It does not have to be a question. It may also be a short comment. Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141832	I am also delighted, and I am sure that Mrs Mona Juul, who is sitting down here, is number three, so it is growing and growing, that is, the fact that we are going against coercion and will volunteer more and more.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141847	Thank you to Mrs Gitte Willumsen. There are no more such brief remarks. The next one is sir. Ole Birk Olesen of the Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407141901	Thank you, and I am so number four in the list that Mrs Gitte Willumsen just had. It is not an ideal situation that we in Denmark have monopolized the housing social task solution for the general housing associations. It is not, and we see this in the fact that we must always clean up after that monopoly, that is, the fact that for decades everyone with housing social problems has been placed in certain areas, certain large areas where they have become neighbours to others with housing social problems. It has created these major problem areas, which we know as Vollsmose and Gellerup and Mjølnerparken etc., and it would have been better if you had a more open approach to who had to pay to solve the housing social problems. However, I believe that it has been hoped, even with the good will of the Enhedslisten, that only the general housing communities will have to receive public support to solve housing social problems. After all, private people do not get public support to solve housing social problems, and what Enhedslisten is proposing with this resolution is that you should just take their accommodation away from them without payment for it. They just have to hand in, contrary to the general housing companies, which have received a great deal of money over the years for the municipalities to be able to direct to the general housing associations. There is both support for the establishment of the general housing companies and their homes, and there is also support from the State for them to be able to pay their loans and their repayment on loan interest, etc. There is support for this from the public sector. And that's why you go to the general housing companies and say: Now you've got all the public support, and now we want you to solve your part of the housing social problems, because that's actually why we give you support. That's for you to take your share of the housing social problems. Then you can't just come running and say to the private: Well, now you also have to make housing available for the housing social problem solution, even if you don't get any money for it like the general housing companies do. All you have to do is do it for free, which is Enhedslisten's suggestion here. We shall, of course, vote against this. But it would be nice if, instead of unconsciously distributing funds to general housing companies, we said: well, let us get those funds in play, let us see who is best at solving the housing social problems. If those who offer the best offers to solve housing social problems are private landlords, then they get some money for it. If it's common housing companies that are the best at it, they get some money. In other words, we are bringing in a competitive situation and saying that those who are best at solving the problems are getting the money to do so. But that is not something that the Enhedslisten is in favour of. We are in favour of the general housing companies still having to get all the money, and now, without any money, private people are going to have to solve the problems for which the general housing companies are otherwise paid. And it's just such an act of interest as it is so often from the Enhedslisten: You wrap it into big punks about social responsibility and cohesion etc., but it's just an act of interest on behalf of certain communities in society, public employees, people on transfer income, general housing associations, etc., who are part of the Enhedslisten's electorate, and who always have to have more at the expense of everyone else. And in this way you secure a seat in the Folketing once more, just as you have done throughout Enhedslisten's time. We are not a part of that and we are voting against the resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142245	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142248	In fact, the last legislative proposal provided for the possibility for municipalities to be able to arrange for the municipal rental of housing, so there is also a third way, and we are very much in favour of this. Ole Birk Olesen tends to speak that Enhedslisten is responsible for certain groups of people. For this matter of housing social work, and what you need to help with in the municipality, I would like to say that it could be people who just got divorced. It is not because Enhedslisten is the party of all those who are subject to a divorce, but I myself live in a housing association where the municipality directs to one in four vacant homes, and a mother who had just divorced, and her two children were assigned a residence in the housing association at one time because it was appropriate, for then the children could continue in the school located in our vicinity. In other words, it is also part of the housing social effort, so it is not because it is more complicated than that. It is then not everywhere that you have general housing where it would make sense that the municipality could point to some private rental. It's just a matter of helping some private landlords to find tenants, so this is not so dangerous, and we're not out on any other business in connection with private rentals.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142401	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142403	This is the usual chat from Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen. When you try to point out something factual, you just talk and talk about things that don't make sense. This isn't about whether Enhedslisten is for people who get divorced, it's about Enhedslisten having undertaken to be the mouthpiece of the non-profit housing associations. Not necessarily those who live there. Sometimes there are converging interests, but sometimes there are not. It is the general housing associations, it is the institution or the type of housing that Enhedslisten has undertaken and which Enhedslisten thinks is better than everyone else, so it must have all sorts of privileges, while others should not have the same privileges, but now they are about to take on some of the tasks for which the general housing sector is paid, but for which others are not paid. That's what I'm talking about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142450	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142453	Well, the rapporteur is doing everything possible to maintain all his prejudices about the Enhedslisten, but I was hoping that a factual dialogue could help to make it slightly more nuanced. We are in favour of working with mixed neighbourhoods, and it also has something to do with settlements. And the proposal or proposal made by the Social Democratic Party to open up the possibility that there was an authorising right to one in ten dwellings in larger rentals could actually help to secure more mixed residential areas, but the rapporteur is obviously not in favour of this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142528	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142529	Every single day we have treatments in this Chamber, and every week we have treatments here, Enhedslisten confirms even the prejudices that people may have about Enhedslisten, including my prejudices, and it is about to have a completely one-eyed focus on the private being evil, and everything that is publicly and publicly supported is good. And there must be more public and more public support, and there must be less private. That is the common thread through Enhedslisten's position on all proposals in this Parliament, namely that the private is evil and that the public is good.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142600	Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142601	Thank you. Now I know that the rapporteur knows this area very, very well. Is there anything to prevent the home municipality of the citizen, the mother described by the rapporteur from the Enhedslisten, from reaching an agreement so that a roof could be overwhelmed? Well, this isn't about keeping someone out, but it's just about avoiding coercion and making sure there's a volunteer. Because we probably have a society that is very much built on volunteering, and we are happy to share it, we are happy to accept it, and we are happy to contribute all the way through. This must only be done through voluntary agreements, precisely because all the money that should help to ensure good work for those who now live there will otherwise only end up in the public interest. Does the rapporteur agree with me on this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142652	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142653	That is absolutely correct. Municipalities can make contracts with private landlords that private landlords provide housing for housing social problem solving in the same way as general housing companies are obliged to do so because they receive massive public support. It only requires most often that the municipality is willing to pay something for the housing social problem-solving in the private sector, as well as paying with the general housing companies through public support, and we have even made it easier to do it here, through the latest agreement. So all doors are open to it, but Enhedslisten's wish is that the municipality should be able to demand access to housing in the private sector without having to pay anything for it, even if the municipalities pay from the general public. But I don't want them to do that in private.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142741	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142743	So, as in other areas, for example. If the money were to follow the child, could the money be allowed to follow the citizen, and then perhaps we could actually have an even greater availability in the private housing stock for those who had a housing need? It was a very good idea, the rapporteur who just threw up in the air. Thanks for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142800	Thank you. It is part of an old housing policy paper that I made for the Liberal Alliance back in 2012 or something like that, so instead of giving the general housing companies all the money, you take that pool of money and distribute it to those who are willing to take on a housing social problem solution. And if there are some private people who want to do it and who do it better than the generals, then it is they who must have the task and the money, and if it is the general organisations that are still the best at solving housing social problems, then they must have the task and then they must have the money.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142831	Mrs. Halime Oguz.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142834	Thank you, and thank you for your speech. We on the left are always accused of defending the interests of the socially disadvantaged. Then I would like to know whether the Liberal Alliance is in charge of Saxo Bank and the interests of larger companies. Well, how much do these companies and Saxo Bank influence Liberal Alliance policy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142904	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142907	They have about the same influence on the policy of the Liberal Alliance as they have on the policy of the Red Cross and the policy of the International People's Party when they give money to them. It is charity on their part and we use the money to the best of our knowledge and the liberal programme of principles that we are running for. The Left has never been accused of defending the interests of the socially disadvantaged. The Left is sometimes accused of looking after the public services and the trade unions and the institutions and organisations which claim that they work only for the socially vulnerable. In other words, it is the organisations and the employees and the trade unions that are accused of defending the interests of the left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142947	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407142949	Then I would like to ask the rapporteur whether these organisations and the trade union movement do not meet the interests of the socially disadvantaged or the challenges they face. Is it not true, then, that in this way they become a voice for the socially vulnerable?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407143010	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407143011	Some of the organizations do. The trade unions, which have to do with public servants working in these fields, are primarily responsible for the interests of members, because they are the ones paying the quota and the interests of members are not always the same as those of users. So, public sector users do not always have the same interest as public sector producers, just as Føtex customers do not always have the same interests as Føtex.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407143036	Thank you, sir. Ole Birk Olesen. There are no more brief comments. I do not see any more rapporteurs in the Chamber who have not spoken, so we shall now turn to the rapporteur for the author of the motion for a resolution, Mr President. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407143105	The Enhedslisten is happy to help small people in society, and here in the Parliamentary Chamber we have tried to help the largest party to get its policy through, and that has not yet been fully achieved today. After all, what we have debated is a question of guaranteeing a municipal authorising right to private rental property, and what we would like to see is that the Folketing instructs the government to ensure by the end of 2022 the extension of the possibilities for municipalities to direct residential residents to residential buildings in private rental properties, corresponding to the full content of the initiative in the government's project I think that when political agreements are reached and legislation is adopted which limits people's ability to move into certain residential areas, and this is what has happened, people's ability to move into those areas where there are more than 30%. with non-Western background. Then there are some people who have been waiting for those housing associations, perhaps for a long time, and maybe they are on that waiting list because it is a low rent that is in those areas, and what should you do when you can't move into that area? It could, for example, be done. be a family that does not have a full-time job and has a low income and then does not have the opportunity to move in there, and so what? Yeah, well, you've limited your options. That is why I think there is a balance in what the Minister of Housing came out with, saying, when we are dealing with municipalities that have exposed residential areas or areas of prevention, as it came to be called, then the municipality should have an increased authorising right to the private rental stock in larger buildings and for one in ten home owners. Actually, it's not that crazy. After all, it is a matter of helping some landlords to get tenants in their homes, and landlords have enough housing to rent them out. This has not yet come through in the political agreement that has been made. I understand, then, if I listen a little positively to the debate that has been going on, that there is an opportunity, now that we have to evaluate the voluntary scheme that is included in the bill, with the agreement that the municipalities can conclude voluntary agreements with landlords. So you could do that earlier. And I'm guessing you haven't gotten very far in making that kind of deal. I would guess that it might get a little spread in some cities where it is difficult to rent certain housing with a high rent; there it might well be counted in the statistics. So it looks like I have to have more patience than I have and wait three years for there to be an evaluation of that part of the agreement. And then I listen to, even though Radicals and the SF do not end up saying that they support the resolution, and the Social Democrats do not either, that the composition of the Folketing now could be a majority in three years' time. And, of course, I think that if we continue to make good decisions in here and then it could be the same majority here in three years' time, there could be an opening to the fact that we came to the conclusion that the municipality could increase the authorising rights for more housing. In fact, I think that would be sensible. It is not right that all those who face an acute housing problem and may have other problems should live in general residential areas. It would be advantageous for the municipality to be able to designate other dwellings as well. I can hope that this debate will help to ensure that this view is spread out. I understand that at this stage four people are opposed to this proposal, and that is not so many, so I am, in fact, positive in my approach to ending up with the fact that you have the tools in the municipality to be able to direct homes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407143520	Thank you. No one has any comments, so the debate is closed. I propose that the draft parliamentary resolution be referred to the Committee on the Interior and Housing. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407143534	The debate is open. It's the tax minister first.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407143607	The motion for a resolution to abolish the so-called phantom tax is a revenant. The Phantom tax is the proposal of the proposers for a description of what is referred to in tax terms as the taxation of current benefits, i.e.: in situations where there is a transfer of an undertaking and where payment is not made at once but is ongoing in the form of milestone payments, e.g.: based on the achievement of certain results. In October 2020, the Conservative People's Party tabled motion for a resolution B 13 on the abolition of phantom tax and, with B 13, the aim was to impose on the government a revenue-neutral regime whereby business owners have to pay tax on profits when they receive the milestone payment. This resolution was rejected. The Conservative People's Party has then joined forces with a number of other parties on this occasion, but the proposal is basically the same, namely that the government is required to draw up a revenue-neutral system where tax is payable only when payment is received in concrete terms. The motion for a resolution is based on the fact that entrepreneurs and business owners are forced to pay taxes on money that they have not yet received, or potentially never received. The proposal refers as a possible solution to the rules which already exist for the part of the purchase price relating to the transfer of goodwill, without, however, requiring payment to fall within seven years. The proposal implies that the seller obtains deferred payment of the tax until the milestone payments fall. There may, of course, be situations where it is an advantage for the parties who enter into an agreement that taxation should be carried out on a regular basis. It can, for example, be done. if the buyer does not have the full purchase price here and now, if there is disagreement between the parties on the valuation of the entity or if there is only a general uncertainty about the valuation. It can, for example, be done. agreed that the seller as part of the sales price receives 10%. of the company's profits for the first 7 years after the sale. Under current rules, the seller is taxed during the year of the transfer of an estimated present value of the future milestone payments, regardless of whether the milestone payments will actually be paid. The seller is thus deemed to have acquired the right to the full amount of the sale at the time of the contract. In other words, taxation is also based on the general principle of the rule of law, which in tax law determines when to tax. The present value of future payments, i.e. what is taxed is determined by the parties, i.e. buying and selling together. This is happening, among other things. taking into account the uncertainty about payments. On the other hand, the seller is not taxed on an ongoing basis by the individual benefits until they exceed the amount fixed. The seller obtains a deduction if the full amount is not paid. In other words, the seller ends up being taxed only by the services which the seller actually receives. It is therefore not a question of the seller being taxed on money that he never gets. On the other hand, the model implies that the buyer obtains full depreciation access at the time of the sale and therefore not only at the time when the payments fall. So it's an advantage for the buyer. The government stresses that the tax rules do not stand in the way of the growth of Danish companies, but we must also ensure appropriate and coherent taxation. That is why the rules must be based on fundamental principles. It is the Government's view that the set of rules has achieved a reasonable balance, taking into account both the situation of the seller and the buyer. So it is true that today there is a grace regime for the part of the sale price relating to goodwill. This also makes sense, since goodwill is particularly difficult to value. The same considerations do not necessarily apply to the transfer of physical assets such as: real estate or means of operation. In addition, the grace scheme for goodwill is not interest-free and, therefore, the extension of such a scheme would not be revenue-neutral. In the government, we are in favour of our tax system, of course, being as simple and transparent as possible and of entrepreneurs not being discouraged from starting new business. We also listen when someone points out problems with the rules in force. The authors of the motion for a resolution propose one solution. It is stated that the solution will be revenue-neutral, but it will actually lead to less revenue for the public sector, since taxation will be deferred by an interest-free deferral system, just as we know from the goodwill-transfer system, which is also referred to in the motion for a resolution. That is why the government cannot, as a starting point, support the motion for a resolution. There should be no doubt that the government takes the issue seriously, which is why I would also like to give an assurance from the platform that before the end of the year I will present the Committee on Taxation with a concrete revenue-neutral model, where the seller's payment of tax is first made, as the milestone payments fall due. This will give us all a better basis for a political position on the changes to the rules at that time. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144134	Thank you. It is a comment from Mrs Mona Juul, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144138	Thank you very much, and thank you very much to the tax minister for wanting to make a solution. Because that is exactly what the resolution is about. There is an opportunity here, and if it turns out that it is not good enough, then I am sure that the tax minister, along with his official work, can find a model that is really going to remove this phantom tax. But I just have to be absolutely sure, because the former tax minister in the government has, after all, answered a question under B 13 about this being revenue-neutral, and it was considered that less revenue would be very modest. Is this the same assessment now, that is, that it is very modest? Or is it simply an assessment that it would be too violent with the model proposed in the proposal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144219	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144220	I don't have any updated ratings. So if that's the answer at the time, I don't remember seeing an up-to-date assessment of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144233	Mrs. Mona Juul, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144234	Thank you. Then I think it is a very modest loss of revenue that can be seen in it, but I look forward to seeing a new calculation on that. On the other hand, you could also say that the fact that you now actually have to pay your taxes when you get the money in your hand means that you don't have to borrow money, and you don't have to build a fortune until you can make this sale. And that may also mean that there will be more purchases and sales and that therefore there will actually be a gain for the state.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144305	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144306	I don't know, and now I'm a minister, so I have to be careful not to sit around and speculate too much. In other words, it can be said that if the system proposed in the motion for a resolution is not revenue-neutral, as I also say in the speech, it is because, if you move the payment forward in time without interest, the public sector loses the return on the money that is paid up front. Whether this amount is large or small, I am happy to reply in writing and make an updated assessment of it. But it is the return that disappears, plus that there is the risk that the money will never be paid, and that risk may in fact be more difficult to qualify. But it is there, and that is why I really think that the model that is today is fair and fair. It gives the buyer some benefits because you can write off the full amount for a start, and it gives the seller • by getting a deduction • a guarantee that if what you have sold is actually of a greater or lesser value, there will be an adjustment along the way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144408	Thank you. We move on to the rapporteur's line, so that's Mr. Brian Bressendorff, Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144420	Thank you for the floor. Today we are discussing a resolution which will require the government to present a model that will allow the abolition of the so-called phantom tax to be abolished. The motivation for the resolution is basically to ensure proper conditions for both the seller and the buyer when a company is to be sold. In Social Democracy, we are very concerned about ensuring sustainable and good conditions for our entrepreneurs and our business owners who strive every day to develop good ideas, services and goods, which is why we are naturally also aware of this when discussing business-related issues. We also believe that it is important that our tax rules are as simple and transparent as possible. So we share that view. The rules we have today follow a tax-free principle that the seller is taxed during the year of disposal of an estimated present value of future milestone payments. In this way, the seller is considered to be entitled to the entire sale price at the time of the contract and therefore follows the general principle of the date of acquisition of the right, which is, of course, crucial in assessing the date of taxation. At the same time, the rules are designed in such a way that the seller and buyer jointly find out what the agreed milestone payments can be valued for. If the seller should not receive the agreed payments, the seller will receive a deduction for the missing amount. That is why perhaps the nickname phantom tax is a bit wrong, since the seller is not finally taxed on an amount that you never get. Nevertheless, we are fully aware that, in some sectors in particular, it can present a number of challenges, for example. in the biotech industry, in the research and development of new medicines, where development costs are increasing, the further to the development process, but the uncertainty about the final approval and marketing remains quite great. Of course, we fully understand that milestone payments are being made in such situations, and nobody wants tax rules to stand in the way of growth and development. The challenge with this proposal, however, is that it will not be revenue-neutral, as taxation will be deferred by means of an interest-free deferral mechanism. That is why the Social Democrats cannot support the proposal. Well, then, sir, I'd like to say hello. Carl Valentin, SF, and say that they support the intention of the proposal and look forward to the government returning with a proposal for a revenue-neutral model, but do not support up... Thank you. No, you can say that another party does not support or that they support, but you cannot make a rapporteur speech for another party). It's okay. Then I also welcome Mr. Rune Lund, who says the same thing, that they support the intention but do not support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144708	The rapporteur is also new, so it is completely forgivable. It's fine. We'll take care of that another time. That's good. Beginning is always difficult. Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144717	Thank you to the rapporteur. It is true that when Morten Bødskov was Minister of Taxation, we received both the reply from the platform and in writing afterwards, that it is considered to be a smaller revenue and that it would be very modest. It is clear that we must, of course, assess what that really means. So, what is a modest revenue? But I would just like to arrest the rapporteur for saying at some point that the phantom tax could be such a nickname, because you get that is why there are a lot of trades that are not being carried out because you cannot be sure that you get your money. That is precisely why the biotech industry, the life-science industry, is being hit because they have such low success rates. I just want to make sure that the rapporteur is fully involved.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144807	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144807-2	Thank you for the question. I totally agree with that. If not, we will have a deduction, but, as I said, we also support the intention behind the proposal, and I look forward to the future model.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144822	Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144823	Thank you. I am absolutely sure, and I am confident that the Minister of Taxation will find a solution to this, and that is also necessary. So thank you for your announcement. But remember, this is because you don't necessarily get your money, but you get the damn money to pay taxes, and it's a strange scheme that you have to pay taxes on money you haven't gotten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144842	I think I have the answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144846	Thank you. There are no more comments. Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm, Left, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407144856	Thank you for the floor. Thank you to Conservatives and to the others who are in this motion for a resolution. It is to some extent a re-submission of the resolution tabled by Conservatives a year and a half ago, which also dealt with the Phantom Tax. And what's the phantom tax? If you look up the tax lists, there isn't a treasure called the Phantom Tax. But it is a concept that is used about the tax that companies have to pay, typically when they are listed on the stock market, from one day to the next without necessarily having had money in their hands. This is a very real issue, which is a growth killer for a great many companies. We also agreed that this was a problem last time. There we were concerned because it is important for us that we continue to hold to the principle of legal acquisition and that it should be revenue-neutral. We have set in motion a parliamentary working group as a result of this, and I think we have actually worked very well together in the parliamentary working group in the Folketing, where this is one of the things we are touching on, but we also touch on various other issues, such as: employee shares. I just want to congratulate the Danish Parliament on being able to make broad agreements. You can work with things for a long time and go into depth with them. Our work showed that there are far more stock exchanges in Sweden than there are in Denmark. And what's the difference? Why is it that we cannot attract the same stock exchange quotations? Well, historically, we've had about the same number of stock exchange quotations, but there was a time when Sweden moved away from us. And if we look at the big entrepreneurial companies in Denmark, we can see that there are very many of them who have moved abroad to be listed. That's really, really too bad. In connection with this parliamentary working group, I have entered into dialogue with many of these companies and tried to ask: Well, what challenges do you face? They say that they face two main challenges: funding and recruitment. As far as funding is concerned, this is part of it, this with this tax on money you're not really getting in your hand. That is why we actually wrote it into our report in the parliamentary working group, and I would like to acknowledge that a very large part of the Folketing is behind it. So there we've also said that we're going to look at this part of it. That is why I think we could go further and then say: this was a fine motion for a resolution. Because in this resolution there is no such thing as that it has to be in one way. In other words, it is proposed that we should not put an end to the rule of law and that it should also be revenue-neutral. I think that is two rather important issues in that. But I think we should solve this problem. So, of course, I am also very pleased that the tax minister says that he will put forward a proposal, I hope that the Minister will launch a debate on it so that we can find a solution in which everyone can see themselves. Then I hope that we can get more stock exchanges in Denmark in the future. Thank you to Mrs Mona Juul for continuing with this. The Left supports the proposal, on which we ourselves are co-sponsors.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407145146	Thank you. There are no comments, and then we move on to Mrs Kathrine Oldag, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407145203	Thank you. When I first met Mrs Mona Juul, we were both sitting in a waiting area and going on TV together and actually had a very good and thorough, long talk about why we had entered politics here in the middle of life as such two half-old wives. I remember Mrs Mona Juul saying in sounding East Jutland: I am here to make solutions, I am not here to make politics. What she meant by it was that she wanted to pick out the drama and flicked and the power struggles and then find solutions that can really be spread out to the delight of Danish business and Danish citizens. So there is something very beautiful about the fact that we are standing here today and discussing a resolution on which Mrs Mona Juul has so much been a banner leader. Even if her party does not always have exactly that approach to work in my optics, I think it must be said that Mrs Mona Juul always delivers. There is no doubt that entrepreneurs and businesses, especially during the start-up phase, have challenges in terms of liquidity when they have to pay this tax. They also have challenges if they get losses later and possibly have paid a tax that is much higher than what they actually got out of it. So we can easily understand the problem and also say last time, when we discussed a similar proposal from the rapporteur, that we would like to find a solution together. And that is precisely what the rapporteur is calling for here and putting forward a solution to that day in the waiting area. We fully agree with the diagnosis, so we have also looked at this new proposal carefully. Last time we could not support the proposal because it included a dispute with a guiding principle of Danish tax law, namely the principle of legal acquisition, but here the wordings of the proposal are slightly softened up, although we still think they are just a tooth for bassante. But because it is softened up a little, I also soften up, so although there are still a few wordings about what Conservatives would like to do instead, I at least choose here to go into solution mode, inspired by Mrs Mona Juul, and push for us to join together in fulfilling the proposal's desire for a revenue-neutral model. Because it turns out that we can solve the problem without, at the same time, ending the rule of law, because we have heard that from the Minister of Taxation in the past. Because is it not precisely a question of finding a solution together and establishing a majority on a model that we can all live with, as the rapporteur on the Left has just pointed out, without perhaps deciding right now what way we should do it? So let us make that solution across the middle of a joint report, also with Mrs Mona Juul and the rest of the bourgeois parties for the benefit and pleasure of Denmark's start-up companies. Regardless of how we technically land it here, it is a fact that the political victory belongs to Mrs Mona Juul. There is no doubt about that. She can cut that out of this speech to her facebook if she wants to. Now you can't use force expression on the country's finest platform, but this is really excellent political craftsmanship, so much thank you to you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407145504	Thank you. There are no comments, so we move on to Mr. Dennis Flydtkjær, Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407145520	The word phantom tax is an amazing word. I think that basically sounds a little crazy, and if the people sit and watch the screens out there and see that now the Folketing has to abolish the phantom tax, then I think most people would actually say: 'We have to get rid of that tax'. It's a bit more complicated, but I actually think that the conclusion will be the same if you ask ordinary Danes out there if you have to change this tax. I actually think the answer will be yes. Because it's all about the fact that when a company is sold, there are often milestone taxes, so you get an amount as a basic amount, and depending on how the company is doing in the future, you can get something more. But the challenge is to be taxed by everything at the time of sale, and that may seem rather illogical. Moreover, I think it is quite normal that there should be cross-border taxation. I have sold a company myself a number of years ago, and then it was also part of the criteria, so I actually think it's something that happens in virtually all the company's traders that there is some kind of milestone tax. But the strange thing, and that is where the phantom tax comes in, is that there may be some situations where to give a low-practical example, you sell a company where the basic amount is DKK 100, and then there may be a milestone tax of DKK 300. Upstairs, but then you're taxed by all 400 kroner. on day one. And I think you can imagine that if you have a personally owned company, it can be quite difficult to pay that tax on the total sum, which can then make you go bankrupt when you have to sell that company. And then what happens? Yeah, well, you naturally don't sell that company. And that's what the problem is, when you have a good company and you may need new capital, maybe in order for the company to continue to operate, some other owners will have to do it at some point, and that's what this legislation's gonna do. So I think it makes great sense to have this so-called phantom tax changed, so that you are taxed when you actually get the money in your hand, that is, when you have the income, and not by what you think you get in your income forward-looking. It is also for the same reason that we chose, when we had the resolution last time, to actually support it. There it was a purely conservative proposal. This time we have chosen to be co-sponsors of the proposal, because we really think it is a problem for businesses out there and it is quite reasonable that it should be changed. So, of course, we support it this time too and look forward to having a new model, hopefully. In conclusion, I would like to say that there is also some Christiansborg in it. Well, here you have a majority saying that now we need a new model for this, and then the government says: no, we cannot support that, but we come up with a new model. Why, then, can we not just support the motion for a resolution which requires the government to come up with a new model? No, you don't want to, because you have to come up with a model yourself. Well, there's a little too much Christiansborg over it. Could we not just support this proposal, which is on the table and which comes with the new model that we want to make ourselves? Well, it gets a little weird. But the Danish People's Party supports this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407145800	Thank you. There are no brief comments. We move on to Mr. Ole Birk Olesen. New citizens aren't here, so it's the Liberal Alliance. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407145808	If you were a consultant in some industry, and you got a 3-year contract for some work you had to do for a company, and then the tax administration said: Well now you got the contract, so now you have to pay the tax on what you're going to earn for the next 3 years... most people would probably understand that it was a rather strange situation to put people in. And in the same way it would be if you were a company that signed a contract with another company to sell a product for the next 3 years at a certain amount with a particular delivery each year and with an annual payment, and then the tax administration said: Well, for the next 3 years you can be taxed by here and now you would also understand that it was a little weird. However, according to the Minister of Taxation, it is quite natural that in the sale of one company to some others here and now the future profits that sell the sale should be taxed if there is a future payment from the profits generated by the company. I can't find the logic of it. Sometimes, when the people of the system or a minister go up and say, "That's how it is, and everyone has to agree that that's how you do it, then you can be a little ensnared by the authority they have and think: well, that may be when they say it. But if you try to put it in relation to how it is elsewhere, it may be a little more difficult to understand that it really has to be that way. For tax must be levied because we have to pay our public expenditure; tax must not be levied in a way that would make it unnecessary for those who pay to be harassed by it. And the experience out there is that you're being unnecessarily bothered by this. That is why I am delighted that a majority will vote through this resolution, which has led the government to say: but it also intends to do what the motion for a resolution says. This was intended to be done all by itself, we understand. But we cannot vote in favour of the motion for a resolution, which contains a request for the government to do what the government has now suddenly discovered that it will do on its own. It is strange, but we welcome the majority.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407150023	Thank you. There are no comments here either. This means that it is now Mrs Mona Juul who is the rapporteur for the proposers. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407150041	Thank you for the floor. There is no doubt that I chose to go into politics because I think that politics is too much about distributing and too little about getting, about cutting the slices thinner and thinner instead of baking the social cake bigger. A good place to start baking is to remove barriers to growth for our exports and related industries, for those who drive income to Denmark and who each day finance schools, hospitals, infrastructure and green conversion and much more. One of the major growth inhibitors is the so-called phantom tax, i.e. a tax that you pay from money you haven't gotten maybe even money you'll never get. In this country, fantasy money is simply taxed, and frankly it does not make much sense, especially when there is no reason to have the phantom tax and the removal of it, according to the Treasury itself in previous answers, is considered to be merely a small amount of revenue. Understandably, it doesn't really cost anything. On the other hand, there is every reason to believe that abolition will give a boost to some of the industries hit hardest by phantom tax, namely biotech and life sciences companies. We don't often hear about the hardships, because the companies don't whine and don't like to get the focus. But I have just two examples that I would really like to give. A UK pharmaceutical company will buy a license for a project from a Danish biotech company. This is a trade of over 4 billion. kr. It is agreed that approx. 12% payment for the purchase of licenses and the rest in these success-dependent milestone payments. However, the phantom tax makes the net proceeds negative. The Danish and foreign investors in the company therefore oppose the trade, although overall it is very attractive to both company and investors. Buyer and seller are part of a long negotiation process to reduce the negative impact of the phantom tax. But alas, the phantom tax ends up being a direct reason why the very attractive trade is not being carried out. At the same time, the seller's investors report great dissatisfaction with the Danish conditions and have not since invested in Denmark. It's a classic example. Another is a European pharmaceutical company that will invest in a Danish biotech company. It was a deal for over 2 billion. kr. 20% the payment by purchase and the remainder by successful milestone payments. But again the phantom tax made the trade worthless for Danish shareholders and employees, unless they renounced the milestone payments, which they actually did! So today they receive only 20%. of the payment they would otherwise have been able to receive. For the company, which is now a Danish subsidiary of the European buyer, is successful with the projects, so several milestone payments have since been made to the seller, but thus not the Danish shareholders and employees who had to settle for this 20%. of what they would have received if the phantom tax had not had to be paid at the time of the conclusion of the purchase agreement. The point is that when Danish biotech companies are worse off than companies from other countries because they cannot motivate employees with stock options, it is a clear competitive disadvantage. And that is why it is so important that we fight against the unjust and growth-retardant phantom tax. We should not just love entrepreneurs, be entertained by them in the Lion's cave or applaud them for various awards; we should put a cash price on skilled entrepreneurs who contribute to this welfare society that we have today. We must make it easy and attractive to operate in Denmark, and we must ensure that investments land right here with us. That is why we tabled the proposal in autumn 2020 right here in Parliament to abolish the phantom tax. Unfortunately, this was not adopted at the time. There were some challenges in relation to the principles of tax law. We listened to this and instead formulated a proposal on the deferral system. The fact that a grace period is granted for the payment of the profit tax, which is triggered at the time of the contract, is not contrary to the principle of legal certainty, as the Minister also confirmed from the platform, because the tax claim on the profit margin has just occurred at the time of the contract. It is only the payment itself that can be applied for. It is therefore not a question of abolishing taxation, but only of a system whereby the tax payment can be deferred until the date on which the seller receives the current payments. Thankfully, this wording succeeded in bringing all the blue parties together as proposers. Thank you so much. It's really, really good. Perhaps it also succeeded because, when dealing with the first motion for a resolution under Mrs Louise Schack Elholm's idea, we created a working group to look at taxes and the conditions of entrepreneurs. It was a useful and rewarding work. Thank you. In any case, we are now here with Mrs Kathrine Ollldag's positive statements and thus with a single majority in order to require the government to remove the phantom tax, regardless of which model the Minister then chooses to present. And it can only be too slow. Huge thanks to all of you who have helped and worked for the cause. Thank you to all the parties that have supported. Thank you to the Minister for taking the proposal down constructively. I can only promise that I will be very annoying all the way forward to a legislative proposal and we have all voted green. But for now: Jubi, we actually managed to settle a dispute with the Phantom Treasure today. And I can't actually be in my body for joy. I'm sorry not many people can see it, but I'm dying. I think it's amazing. For today, we are actually ensuring better conditions for our entrepreneurs and businesses, not with pools and nonsense, but with a more fundamental, structural and long-term approach. Goodbye to the Phantom Treasure, you won't be missed!
ParlaMint-DK_20220407150626	Thank you. No one else has asked for the floor. The debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Tax Committee. Are there any comments?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407150651	The debate is open. Sir. Thomas Jensen has changed rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Brian Bressendorff.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407150701	Thank you for the floor, President. Yes, I've promised to help sir. Thomas Jensen. The draft law is part of the implementation of the "Infrastructure Plan 2035', which we politically agreed with a broad majority of Parliament's parties back in June 2021. The many initiatives must contribute to a better link between Denmark and help make Denmark richer and support a greener future. With the plan, we agreed that we would invest in new transport initiatives for a total of 105.8 billion. kr. for the period 2022-2035. And together with the already ongoing investment in innovation and maintenance, we have investments in transport for a total of 161 billion. kr., of which 64 billion. kr. We are talking about the 86 billion. kr. goes to railways and approx. 11 billion kr. A number of pools and other initiatives are involved. This bill addresses some of the major motorway investments located in Central Jutland and North Jutland as well as in Zealand, where the hardship is great. Specifically, we authorise the transport minister to expand the E45 Østjyske motorway between Aarhus Syd and Aarhus Nord, extend the Djurslands motorway between Aarhus Nord and Skejby, extend the E45 Østjyske motorway on the stretch between Vejle Nord and Skanderborg Syd, extend the Hillerød motorway from motorway to motorway and extend the route 40 between Ålbæk and Skagen to a 2 plus 1 road on two routes. The extensions will, of course, take place under the auspices of the Road Directorate. As is the established practice of the Ministry of Transport's construction laws, it is proposed that the Danish Parliament, when adopting the bill, should also grant environmental approval to this effect, and projects will have to be carried out in such a way that environmental impact is kept within the framework of the environmental impact assessments carried out. In the context of the environmental impact assessments for Ålbæk-Skagen, it has been assessed that this will be an impact on priority natural habitat types in a Natura 2000 area and this impact is significant. This means that the specific project cannot be initiated until an opinion has been obtained from the European Commission as a result of the Habitats Directive. Denmark must, of course, comply with its EU legal obligations, which is why it has been suggested that the authority to extend the Ålbæk-Skagen will not enter into force until a later date when the European Commission has consulted it. In addition to the authorisation to extend the routes I have already mentioned, the draft law contains a proposal to repeal the law on a new fjord connection at Frederikssund. And why is that? Yes, in short, the law provides for the construction of Crown Princess Mary's Bro, and in addition, the law provides for the establishment of a new company, such as the Royal Danish Orchestra. was to charge for the passage of Crown Princess Mary's Bro, a payment which would then contribute to the repayment of the loan, which was taken up in connection with the construction. However, since the infrastructure plan allocated money to repay the loan referred to above, it also means that there is no longer any need for the user payment to repay the loan. After all, it is a great pleasure for many of the locals that the user fee ended as early as the transition to 2022. In addition, the company responsible for the administration is being wound up and it is proposed that the law should be repealed. In concrete terms, the Minister of Transport will be empowered to bring this part of the law into force at a later date. The comments to the bill state that this part is likely to be put into effect as soon as the company is definitively wound up, which is expected to be in autumn 2022. Finally, the draft law amends the law on equations, which comes under the responsibility of the Minister of Taxation, and in this part it is proposed that a previous deduction for driving on Crown Princess Mary's Bro should now cease, now that you no longer have to pay for crossing the very same bridge. Overall, therefore, this is a legislative proposal which is part of the implementation of the infrastructure plan and which will benefit many people. Social democracy therefore supports the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151110	Thank you. There are no comments, and then we go further in the rapporteur's line. Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151122	Thank you for that, President. I am giving the speech on behalf of the Left rapporteur in this area, Kristian Pihl Lorentzen. The aim of the draft law is to translate parts of the broad policy agreement •Infrastructure plan 2035. With this agreement, we ensure a Denmark that is more closely linked and that makes our society richer and which, at the same time, supports our journey towards a greener future. We in the Left are therefore pleased that this agreement will create shorter and more reliable journey times on routes with positive economic consequences for both the private and the business community. Therefore, we in the Left are delighted that with this construction law we get the expansion of the E45 Østjyske Highway and E45 Nordjyske Highway on the route between Aarhus South and Aarhus North and develop the Djursland Highway between Aarhus Nord and connection facilities no. 20 Skejby from 4 tracks to 6 tracks, that with this law we get the expansion of the E45 East Jutland motorway on the stretch between Vejle and Skanderborg from 4 to 6 tracks, and that with this law we get the extension of the Hillerød motorway from motorway to motorway and the extension of the road between Ålbæk and Skagen, route 40, to a 2+1 road. However, the bill also contains the repeal of the law on a new fjord connection at Frederikssund. The Left notes with great satisfaction that the user fee has now been removed by the turn of the year and that the municipality of Frederikssund is working to ensure that road safety in Frederikssund By is maintained. The Left supports the proposal. Then I have also promised to say that the Conservative People's Party also thinks that this is an excellent legislative proposal and a good way of implementing the agreement on the "Infrastructure Plan 2035'.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151316	Thank you. There are no comments. I just need to clarify something so I'll make sure everyone knows. You may say another party's position on a matter, but you cannot start a rapporteur speech for another party, that simply cannot be done. That's the way it is. Here you go, Mrs. Anne Valentina Berthelsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151343	Thank you for that, President. I shall be very brief, because this proposal is part of our agreement on the "Infrastructure Plan 2035" from this summer, which is why SF can of course also support this proposal. After all, it is no secret that we in the SF are most fond of bicycle paths and public traffic, bus and trains, but this is also part of the mobility and coherence of our country, and that is why I would like to support it here. I just have one question for the Minister of Transport. I note that there are some Supreme Court rulings on wiring works which, according to the Ministry of Transport's note, mean that construction projects will in future be increased by DKK 300 000 to DKK 400 000. per mileage of new motorway, and the judgments that I read them seem to have an immediate financial impact on the construction of these projects. Is that correct, is it being taken into account? If the Minister of Transport can answer that, it'll be great. But besides that, we're backing up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151448	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Henning Hylllested, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151452	Thank you. In Enhedslisten we consider SF to be a green party, and I have seen it in such a way that it also considers SF itself to be. That is why, of course, I would like to ask why it is that we should be involved in an agreement and that we should be in favour of the creation of an extension of a number of motorways, a total of 216 000 tonnes of CO2 generated by the infrastructure agreement. t CO 2 It may seem strange that the SF continues to support this agreement, which was sold as a green deal, but which is black coal. These figures show that, too, we have finally got the figures in this connection.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151605	Thank you, and here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151606	Well, as sir. Henning Hyllested knows, it happens, when we negotiate in the Folketing, that some people get something they like, and in return they must also swallow something that they do not necessarily love. We have done this for a number of projects in Infrastructure Plan 2035. On the other hand, we have also had an influence on something that could otherwise have looked worse, and at the same time we have also got some projects through that might not have been there if SF had not been there. There are also parts of the agreement on roads in the Infrastructure Plan 2035 which we think are sensible, and that is why it was important for us to enter into that part of the negotiations. But we fully agree with the Enhedslisten's rapporteur in his report, and I assume that this is what he is referring to, that it has been questionable that figures for CO2 have been withheld.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151710	Thank you. Then it's mr. Henning Hylllested again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151712	It was not so much the figures that I was going for, because now we have to see that they are actually available for these projects, and that is welcome. They were indeed the ones we called for during the negotiations themselves. No, it's more the thing about SF using that excuse that it might have looked worse, and that you've got some things through that you like. Okay, so what have you got that you don't like, but that you've said yes to anyway? I assume that most of the motorway projects have not grown in SF's backyard. But what could look worse? I fully agree that you will have an influence on some lines, but that doesn't mean that CO2 means at most that you move a line from a place where you bother some people or some nature, to another place where you bother some other people and some other nature. I guess that's what in this case you get out of being a part of it because otherwise it might look worse.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151811	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151812	Now Mr. Henning Hylllested it as if it doesn't matter to the people who, for example, are. live at some of the very inappropriate routes for the Highway, and the nature of some of the very inappropriate routes for the Highway. After all, we have succeeded in moving on to it. I admit that the Army Highway is not a project that we in the SF want, but we have, after all, succeeded in protecting, for example. Some of the nature of Vejle Ådal and others, and we will have to make an effort to do so if we are to be aware of our parliamentary responsibilities. But it's true that these projects haven't grown in SF's backyard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151853	Thank you. There are no more comments, so we go ahead with the rapporteurs. The rapporteur from the Radical Left is not here, and then it is Mr. Henning Hylllested. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407151919	Thank you. After all, the draft law is about the part of our infrastructure agreement that deals with roads or some of the roads that expire on the infrastructure agreement. For the sake of good order, it is also stated in the comments that the Enhedslisten and, for that matter, the Alternative are also outside that part. And we are doing so because we are particularly critical of the expansion of a number of motorways which take place on the one hand, and the extension of existing motorways and, on the other, the construction of entirely new motorways. We are of the opinion that it increases the hardship that is claimed to be combated and dampened by extending the road network. In fact, we believe that there is evidence of this over the many decades in which the road network has been expanded.The congestion has never been greater; this is especially true of our larger cities. It is to the detriment of the environment and the natural values through which motorways are transported. As I said, car driving increases significantly, but at the same time it reduces the passenger footage of public transport. By expanding the road network as violently as has been done for decades, people simply move from public transport, buses and trains, to cars and, to a certain extent, from bicycles to cars, despite the fact that public traffic, including cyclism, is the most sustainable mode of transport we have. I already mentioned in my questions to Mrs Anne Valentina Berthelsen that only the projects listed in the bill here generate 216,000 tonnes of CO2 and, in our opinion, this puts a huge question mark over what the then Minister for Transport and the Ministry of Transport and, in general, the government were very keen on when we made the infrastructure agreement, precisely that this agreement should be sold as green. This was also achieved because of the fact that the public transport projects were included, and it is they who are, if I may say so, moving in a positive direction, in other words reducing CO 2 2 Therefore, in our opinion, it is a coal-black agreement that was made, and this bill is a coal-black bill. We believe that when the Engineer, who at the time was given access to the figures, estimates that there will be an increase in emissions of approx. 1,6 million In this context, of course, we cannot support this bill. I have, of course, deliberately asked about SF's position. The SF and the Radicals usually dress green robes. I could then quote Rasmus Helveg Petersen, the radical rapporteur who is not present. He said at the presentation of our agreement in his time: if it had been a climate agreement, I would feel like an idiot. He actually said that on June 28th, and my question to him had of course been: well, okay, how do you distinguish? When is this a climate agreement and when is it a transport agreement? I do not think that, when you conclude this transport agreement, you can say that the climate can then be ignored. Well, Rasmus Helveg Petersen is not present so he can answer the question, so I must try to see if I can ask him that question in another context; unfortunately that is not possible here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152333	Thank you. There are a few brief comments. Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152336	Thank you so much. I simply have to ask the rapporteur whether the Enhedslisten does not want any more roads at all, yes or no.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152349	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152350	In any case, we do not want any more motorways or any further extension of existing motorways. We have been saying for many years that there may well be roads • it may be bypasses; it may be other roads where it may be necessary; it may be roads where road safety will be ensured; it may be sensible with 2 plus 1 roads around etc. We have always stood for this, and we can easily imagine that. But to continue to develop the motorway network and thus generate more and more car traffic and thereby create congestion, contrary to what is claimed to be the extension of the motorway network, we are quite right to oppose it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152430	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152431	Thank you. In New Citizens we are really happy with roads because it creates mobility, and that makes us tie Denmark better together. I would really like to hear the rapporteur for the Enhedslisten's proposals on the very, very many people, among others. in the various rural areas, where the rapporteur himself lives, in Jutland and around, which are not able to take public transport: how are they going to get around? How are they supposed to do their job? How are they supposed to deliver their children in the morning or visit their old mother at the nursing home? What is Enhedslisten's answer to that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152507	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152508	But it is precisely a development that has arisen because public transport has been phased out. We have failed to invest in it, not least in rail traffic, but indeed in bus traffic around the world. The regions have queued to close routes and lines around. So that is the result of exactly the development in which carism has been waged, that is. the extension of the road network and more and more cars, thereby undermining, as I said, the passenger base of public transport. So it does seem to me, if I may say so, that in the rural areas, first and foremost, there is public transport, which is inadequate and cannot be used by very many people, so that they are forced to use the car. That is exactly what we have been opposed to all the way through because we could foresee this. And then we also have the current problem that the price of fuel is now rising, and it just shows how vulnerable we are when we are betting on carism.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152605	Thank you. Sir. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152607	Sir. Henning Hyllested talks about evidence. That is the new fashion word in Danish politics. If anyone says that the earth is round, there are always some who want evidence that it is true. Is Mr. Henning Hyllested knows that there is evidence that the stork is bringing the children? It can be seen from the fact that in Africa, where there are many storks, they also have many children.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152632	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152632-2	I might want to answer yes to that last one, but I don't. Well, it's a fact, then, if it's not allowed to be called "the fact that over the past five decades car traffic has increased quite dramatically, and it has increased for several reasons, I agree. First of all, it has risen because of the fact that there is room for carism. This has happened while failing to invest in public transport. We must also bear in mind that there are relatively many people still away in this country who do not own a car. Car ownership in e.g. The Copenhagen area is barely 40 per cent. So there is evidence, if I may say so, that carism has increased dramatically, and then we are trying to solve it by extending the road network, which is not actually a success. I mean, you can just look out the window and you'll see that it doesn't add up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152731	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152732	It is the same as claiming that the reason why there are more children in the City of Copenhagen today than 20 years ago is that more kindergartens have been built. No, more kindergarten has been built because there have been more children. The same is true of the cars. There is a larger car ownership in Denmark today because more people want to transport themselves to work and because more people can afford cars. That is the main reason why more cars have arrived. We then try to service this, just as we serve more children with more kindergarten, by also building roads for the car needs and transport needs.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152804	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152805	I would like to dispute that. It can also be said that, as you are aiming for carism, that is to say, you invest in the car industry, and this means that, first and foremost, you invest in the road network on the part of the State and the municipalities, then you have failed to invest in public transport, not least in rail transport. Mr. Ole Birk Olesen all about as former transport minister, i.e. how in Banedanmark today you push a huge maintenance delay ahead of you, with the result that we can see that the Danish railway is in fact on the verge of collapse. So we have not given people a free choice, if I may say so; people have not had the opportunity because they have settled and under-invested in public transport.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152852	Thank you. No one else has any comments, so that's why it's sir. Alex Ahrendtsen, Dansk Folkeparti. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407152913	Thank you, President. The Danish People's Party is happy to be part of the Infrastructure Plan 2035, and for us it is not a either-or, as it is for Enhedslisten. For us, it's a boat and it covers this infrastructure plan so well. There is both for public transport, and then there is for private carism. However, I would like to say that this was a rather interesting discussion, as Mr. Henning Hyllested had with the Liberal Alliance and New Citizens. I was thinking of a picture I saw from Houston, Texas. There were 23 lanes, and they had been expanded over the years because traffic had increased more and more. And then the discussion was: the fact that traffic had increased was due to the extension of the motorway, or was it due to the fact that more cars had arrived? This is an interesting discussion, because what came first, the hen or the egg? At the same time, it was known that wealth had increased in the United States, so there were more people who could afford to buy a car and that there were more people who moved outside the big city because they were able to afford to buy a house. And these things are connected. Well, I guess we're gonna have to expand these highways and these highways, or else they're gonna sand up. What's the alternative? The fact that we don't, and if people keep in line, it doesn't get them into public transport. For public transport is good where there are very many people, for example. in Copenhagen or in Aarhus. Public traffic is also good on the main roads, but all people cannot settle in a city or on the main roads. So it makes sense for us to expand these structural plans with these expansions of motorways and roads. It has been a particular pleasure for me to become a transport rapporteur, because suddenly it is not small amounts that we are talking about. Every time it's billions and I had to get used to it, right? This is something that is decided in a large circle, a broad circle, and I think that is important. This is an important plan for Denmark, so sir. and Mrs Denmark can move around, and I am well aware that this does not solve all the problems. The technology is in many ways with us, so the way we move around today will be quite different in 30 years. The opportunities that autonomous cars will offer us will in many ways reduce the need for private cars, i.e. cars owned by private ones. In a few decades' time you will be able to book over an app a shared car that will then come and pick you up and drive you somewhere, and that will reduce, what to say, the need to constantly expand the motorways. This will make public transport and private carism an interference, but in the meantime we will have to take account of the fact that more cars are coming and therefore this plan makes good sense, and it balances both public transport and private carism in a very good way. So in the Danish People's Party we are happy with the plan that we support, and we look forward in the future to implementing more of these funds in the Assembly Hall. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153309	Thank you. There's a comment from Mr. Henning Hylllested. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153311	Let me just arrest it and say that for Enhedslisten it is not an either-or. However, it is true that, in relation to motorways, we are developing existing and new motorways and so on. etc. That's right. I think that Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen's comparison with the United States was actually a little interesting, because there we see how wrong things can be when you invest quite unilaterally in carism. Sir. Alex Ahrendtsen refers to 23 road maps on a motorway, and that is the way it is outside the very many large cities that you have in the United States. It is because carism has been one-sidedly waged. It is amazing that a country like the United States has no more train traffic than they do, i.e. passenger train traffic. They could ride with fast trains, real fast trains, between a multitude of these many big cities they have. It is amazing that it has not been developed. Of course, when we are so critical of it, it is because car traffic is in every way resource consuming. Not only do you use petrol and at the moment it is a fossil fuel but the cars also occupy a terrible amount of space. We can see that when we look out the windows of our cities. And by the way, they hold on to some of the most expensive land you can raise in the country. At some of the most expensive addresses there are cars and cars and cars, instead of those urban spaces being able to be used by people for one and the other, and what do I know? That is why we believe that this would be sensible, because public transport is not nearly as resource-consuming and not as bulky as cars are. That is why we are so critical, and that is why we are so critical of whether public transport is so undermined or undermined and, in itself, has moved people from public transport to cars. So I would like to add that comment to what Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen says.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153512	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153512-2	But I do not believe that this plan undermines public transport. After all, we are constantly investing billions in public transport. Mr. Ole Birk Olesen. He's been Minister of Transport, or was it the Minister of Transport? Billions! There's new trains coming. It's being developed on the subway. There'll be light lanes. There will be new trains on the West Coast, in West Jutland. After all, public transport in Denmark is really being invested. However, we must do so hand in hand with the expansion of private carism, because they must have the opportunity to enter the main routes. That is why I sometimes do not fully understand Enhedslisten's opposition to it. It makes good sense with public transport in the big cities and on the main roads, but not many other places.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153606	Sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153609	But I have to arrest the fact that we are also investing a great deal of money in public transport. It is true that we currently have a signal programme that is extremely expensive. It is true that new trains have been purchased from DSB, also elsewhere: on some local railways, etc. But if you look at it over a long period of years over 25-30 years back then much more has been invested in carism, in roads first and foremost, in carism at all, than in railways. I think the figures are something like 240-250 billion. kr. in the case of roads and perhaps some 140 billion in the case of roads. kr. in the case of trains. I don't remember the number completely. It is a fact that today we are pushing a huge maintenance delay ahead of us on the railroad. It had been so small in 2014, but it has returned because you are underinvesting in the railroad and are not investing. So the maintenance delay has returned.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153715	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153716	But it is also right for taxpayers to get something for the many billions they put in the treasury each year through fuel taxes, taxes and taxes. These are unbridled sums that the individual citizen spends every year in the treasury, and they must of course also in a way be returned to them, among others. through what we decide today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153745	Thank you, and then there are no more comments. That is why it is Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407153804	This summer, most of the Danish Parliament's parties and New Citizens concluded an infrastructure agreement • All in all, a very good agreement that implements new investments and initiatives that bind Denmark better together and make society richer. Many Danes spend a long time in queues, have long transport between home and work and do not always have the same opportunities for public transport as in the big cities. That is why the need for rapid and continuous expansion of the road network is great, so I am very pleased that with the overall agreement we succeeded in most of the billions for new investment going to the road area. More and better roads are a prerequisite for a more accessible and stronger infrastructure in Denmark, which is why we are now ensuring the development and strengthening of the road network in the years to come that meet the needs of a modern society for mobility and growth. The agreement includes, among other things: extension of the E45, completion of the Frederikssund motorway, extension and extension of the Hillerød motorway, establishment of a third Limfjord connection, motorway to Kalundborg, motorway between Næstved and Rønnede and a Mid Jutland motorway. It is therefore projects that will ensure growth and prosperity in all parts of the country, while at the same time providing for noise reducing measures that citizens in various particularly noise-laden areas have long been looking for. But I can't quite hide it; I'm standing here smiling a lot because it's a very good day for me and for New Citizens, because already at the beginning of 2018 I started the fight to remove the user fee at Crown Princess Mary's Bro in Frederikssund Municipality. In New Citizens we are not in favour of user charges for what binds the country together. It's common sense. I drove town thin. I was out talking to Teddy, who is a trucker, with Erling, who is also a trucker, and with Susanne and with Stefan and with all the others who are really sorry about the extra tax that had been imposed on them. I was told by the politicians that there was a firm agreement and that it could not be changed. They said I might as well give up, and of course I didn't. I'm stubborn. In the 2019 election campaign, one of my main concerns was precisely the abolition of user charges, because it is quite unfair and anti-competitive that there is user charges on a bridge that binds a municipality together. Since the parliamentary elections, I and New Citizens have, of course, as promised, fought hard for a pay-free bridge, and from 1 January 2022 the user fee was happily removed. The payment wall was demolished to the delight of citizens and businesses in the area. It is indeed a very good day today. Ever since the government presented the 49-page project • Denmark forward, I have also been honest that when we went into these negotiations, I probably couldn't get through with all our transport wishes and good arguments, but we fought for it, and I fought hard for it, and I actually think that the overall agreement succeeded quite well. Although there will always be parts in large agreements such as this, which we might not have prioritised or perhaps had given even higher priority if we had a majority, at this stage we had four mandates, and then we must give and take the course of action here if we want to be part of a final agreement. This has been important to us in New Citizens, because we would like to take responsibility for having a Denmark that is more closely connected for the benefit of the Danes, and that is what we are getting now, both with this bill, but also with the overall agreement with a strengthened infrastructure, with better coherent road links throughout the country, and in this way we will be binding more closely in the coming years in Denmark. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154247	Thank you. Then there are a few brief comments. Sir. Alex Ahrendtsen, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154251	You have to count your victories, and congratulations on the bridge at Frederikssund. What I do not quite understand, and as Mrs Mette Thiesen herself said a little bit, is how this is linked to the political value base of New Citizens, which is, of course, a very liberal basis. After all, the payment of the user should be a good thing when you are a liberal party, and a bridge financed by taxpayers and used by taxpayers should, in a liberal sense, be user-funded. How does it relate to the fact that it is the common fund that suddenly has to pay a small bridge at Frederikssund?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154339	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154340	We're bourgeois. We're a bourgeois party. We live in Denmark, which has landed with the world's highest tax burden. And what binds the country together we have from the beginning said in the New Citizens' Party should not be user-paid. This is, of course, something to be financed from the common fund. What we pay taxes for, among other things, is... to secure infrastructure, it is simply core welfare to secure good infrastructure around the country. And I doubt it a little when the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party puts it up here, because it has been a little different, depending on who has been the rapporteur for the Danish People's Party, whether you supported the removal of the user fee or whether you did not. So now I actually have some doubts. In fact, I thought the Danish People's Party supported the removal of the user fee in Frederikssund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154425	Here you go, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154426	I mean, I didn't mean to tease. It was a sincere desire to understand why a liberal party wants the treasury, the common treasury, to pay for the bridge. But the rapporteur has explained that we want taxpayers' money to go to, among other things. State roads and bridges. That's fair enough. I've just been wondering, because on other points, the new bourgeois quite liberal, if I may say so nicely. Don't we agree on that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154453	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154454	So, as I said, we are a bourgeois party, and we think it is quite common sense that what binds Denmark together should not be user-paid. This also applies to the Storebælt Bridge. We still want to abolish user charges for this too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154509	Sir. Henning Hylllested, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154512	I must admit that I think it is going in the opposite direction. Let me just make it clear, for the sake of good order, that I forgot in my rapporteur's speech that Enhedslisten was actually against the user fee at the time. This was not something we made a great deal of money out of, but it was a position in principle that we do not think regional relations should be user-paid. However, we were opposed to the construction of the project in general for climate and, above all, environmental reasons. So it wasn't because we made a lot of sense. But it's just to make it clear. The rapporteur says that the expansion of these motorways contributes to Denmark's being and becoming a modern society. But can it not be that you are actually being overtaken by developments? What does it mean to be a modern society? Well, I can say that, for example. Sweden, Germany, Norway and our neighbouring countries, after all, are investing heavily in rail traffic, and I think they consider themselves also to be modern societies. And it is, of course, the question whether you do not come to the conclusion at some point that a modern society is also a society where you do not keep in line and which is emission-free and CO2 so I would like to hear comments on that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154629	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154630	So a modern society is not necessarily emission-free. I think that stands for Enhedslisten's own bill, that. We do not think so at all. Now I would like to say that railways are so much an old technology and something that also requires extremely high maintenance. So no, we would rather see much more roads being developed. We could easily expand even more in our optics. There will also be self-propelled cars at a time, as was mentioned earlier. BRT solutions could also be very much established. So, no, we certainly believe that continuous expansion of the road network is the only right way to go. Moreover, we are also thinking, for example, of the rural areas that the Enhedslisten's rapporteur might not have quite included in his calculations. Because it is the case that not all Danes live around the big cities and have access to public transport. And, of course, you have to have the opportunity to adapt more as a family as you like. And that also includes, for example, affording car number two and having proper infrastructure where you live.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154736	Thank you. Sir. Henning Hylllested, here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154739	Thank you. Well, that's a very interesting statement. I simply understand the statement as if we really believe that the railways should be abandoned and that the existing railway should also be abandoned in favour of extending car traffic by road and so on. etc. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. That's quite interesting. Let me say that the problems in the outermost regions and so on. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware of the fact that the Commission is not in a position to take a decision on this matter. There was plenty in his time. There were buses in every village at some point. When I was young, it was like that. And when I was even younger and child, there were even more buses driving around. However, they have been settled by political decisions, because carism has been one-sidedly targeted, and the number of cars and roads has been increasing dramatically since then.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154842	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154843	Well, it's gonna be a little chicken or egg. In New Citizens we have been quite clear from the outset that we are giving priority to roads across rails. It has never been a secret. We're pretty open about what we want. And I think the rapporteur for the Enhedslist knows that too. So I cannot really understand why the rapporteur is surprised. With regard to the second, the so-called dismantling of public transport in rural areas, etc. It is basically a question of being able to settle anywhere and have the opportunity for a good infrastructure. That is also why we, among others, are here. Says that we want to abolish the registration tax, so that everyone has the opportunity to buy the car they want, and perhaps also more cars, so that a greater mobility is precisely created, which also includes ensuring a good road network.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154931	Then it's mr. Peter Juel-Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407154933	Thank you and thank you for a fine speech from the rapporteur. What made me stand up was one of the things the rapporteur said, and that, of course, was what focused on the bridge to Frederikssund. It is so that a victory has many fathers that it has failed rarely. In the Left, we were very supportive of this, because we were gradually very, very tired of hearing Hans Andersen talk about the bridge charge all the time. And there is no doubt that there is a great deal of work behind it. The rapporteur from the Enhedslisten said just now that regional relations should not be subject to user charges, and I very much agree with that, and I am pleased that it should no longer cost money to get to Frederikssund. Is this also the connection to Bornholm? Because there is indeed a user fee to get on the ferry. Does the rapporteur therefore take the view that Enhedslisten also believes that it is no longer necessary to pay for the ferry to Bornholm?
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155031	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155031-2	I think I simply have to get it back as to what the Enhedslisten wants. I am not going to be wise about what the Enhedslisten wants, but I know that we and the Left are very much in agreement that we should introduce this full road principle, which also gives what we in New Citizens call road equality, i.e. that it should not be more expensive to sail 1 km than to drive 1 km. I know that the rapporteur had a motion for a resolution in the House on this not long ago, which we also warmly supported. I also love coming to Bornholm and of course think it should be easier and cheaper to get to the sunshine lake.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155107	Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155109	When I put the question to the rapporteur from the New Citizens' Party, it was because I have missed the opportunity to put the question to the Enhedslisten's rapporteur. For at that time Enhedslisten had not said that there should be no user charges on regional routes or for bridges or ferry routes, one also had to understand. I think that is a very interesting point of view. However, I had also hoped that the rapporteur might have spent some time thanking other parties who, together with the rapporteur, have fought for a bridge tax to be abolished on the bridge to Frederikssund. Here I am thinking of the good Leftman Hans Andersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155142	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155143	I think it is wonderful that we have got the country an agreement in which this user fee is abolished, and I have highlighted the efforts of New Citizens, because it is we who have, like, fought for this from the start. There have also been some, let's just say divergent interests in the municipality of Frederikssund, also for the Left, in relation to the abolition of this user fee. However, I am glad that the Left backed up when we were sitting in the negotiations. Now, for good reasons, I cannot know what has been said when it took place bilaterally, at the various meetings, but I can briefly say that I am very pleased that the Left also ended up supporting the desire that New Citizens have had so long to remove the user charge for the bridge to Frederikssund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155222	Thank you. Then there is another rapporteur on the way, and that is Mr. President. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155233	First, I'm gonna give you some history. Back in 2009, the minister for transport was Lars Barfoed. He was from the Conservatives and, together with a broad majority in the Danish Parliament, he led a broad agreement, which was called the green transport settlement. That was about. 100 billion kr., and two thirds of the 100 billion. kr. was used on the railroad. It's just to put Mr. Knox down. Henning Hyllested's eternal talk that there are underinvestments on the railroad, in perspective. So in the great transport conciliation in 2009, two thirds were spent on the railroad, despite the fact that it is only 10%. of the transport carried out on rails, while 90% of the transport carried out on rails. the transport takes place on the way. In this transport agreement, with all the things you would like to prioritise, you could not find money to build a new bridge at Frederikssund. Although it was recognised that there was a need, it was nevertheless felt that the need to do other things with the 100 billion. kr. one could obtain was bigger than making a bridge. Then it took three years, and then the new Minister for Transport made it, sir. Henrik Dam Kristensen, an agreement with Frederikssund Municipality that you could build the bridge at Frederikssund, even if you did not have money for it in the Treasury, by introducing user charges on the bridge. There was a unanimous council in Frederikssund, which supported this, because you really wanted to have that bridge, even if there was no money for it, and you would like to use the user fee as a way to finance the bridge. That is why the agreement was put into effect in the hand of construction, that is, because it was possible, even if there was no money for it in the 2009 agreement. When the bridge is finished and people are happy to have the bridge and run over the bridge with the small user fee, you start to say: yes, it is good enough that we have got this bridge, but can we not get rid of the user fee, which was the prerequisite for the bridge to be built? And then there is a folk atmosphere where you in Frederikssund Municipality will not stand by the agreement you have made, and now you need to have the money to free the bridge for user charges in the new transport agreement, which is being made, because now new money is coming on the table, as we are no longer in the period 2009-2020, but in the period 2020-2035, and there is also some infrastructure money available, and they can be used to remove the user charges on Kronprinsesse Marys Bro. We choose to do that in that agreement, and we think that is fine, because you might as well spend it on it as you can spend it on so much else. But the whole rhetoric up to it that one had somehow been cheated in Frederikssund, because one had got a bridge with user charges, which one would have liked, because the only way to get the bridge was that there was user charges, that is, because the money in the infrastructure agreement was spent on something else, and everyone who sang along on the rhetoric also sang falsely, because one had not been cheated; one had got a bridge early. But that does not mean that we cannot change the decision, and we did. That is why we are also voting in favour of this bill, which now removes the user fee at Crown Princess Mary's Bro in Frederikssund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155551	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments and there are no more rapporteurs, but then it is the Minister for Transport. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155604	Thank you for that, and also thanks to the rapporteurs for the comments and comments on the draft law, the satisfaction of the draft law and, above all, the support for the draft law. As you know, a major political agreement on an investment plan in transport was reached in June 2021 for the period 2022-2035. I want this bill to help translate parts of the deal. Indeed, it is important that we invest in infrastructure throughout the country and that we both increase public transport and ensure accessibility on the road network. The latter is what this bill is about. The rapporteur has already mentioned which sections the draft law authorizes the Minister of Transport to expand. This applies to developments around the country, so I will not go into that further, but what is important to say is that the expansions must ensure the better availability and thus also prevent further queues on the stretches, and this is very important for the everyday lives of thousands of Danes who do not have a waste of time • time that they would otherwise be able to spend with the family or with going to work, and thus we also avoid a great socio-economic loss. So the bill we are adopting here today is of benefit and benefit both to the individual and to society as a whole. In accordance with the rules, the Road Directorate has carried out environmental assessments of the impact of the projects and, as is the case with construction projects, it will of course also have impacts, including negative impacts. Unfortunately, it can't be any different. However, it is also important to bear in mind that projects can help improve existing conditions. An example of this is the water dissipation in connection with the project for the Hillerød motorway. Today road water is discharged directly to ditches or troughs, where road water can seep down to groundwater. As part of the project, it is proposed that an edge collection of road water be established, where all water from the road is fed into closed systems for rainwater basins, and this also means that the risk of drainage to groundwater is significantly reduced. In addition to authorising the Minister of Transport to put the bucket in the ground and extend existing road sections, the bill also includes a proposal to repeal the law on a new fjord connection at Frederikssund. The proposal, as has also been mentioned, should be seen in the continuation of the abolition of the payment for passage on Crown Princess Mary's Bro. 1 January 2022. The decision could be taken when the infrastructure plan allocated funds to implement the loan taken in connection with the installation of Crown Princess Mary's Bro. The loan has been repaid and the repeal of the law will therefore result in the end of the ban on driving for trucks or truck trains with a total weight of 3,5 tonnes or more on Crown Prince Frederik's Bridge. Finally, I would like to thank you for the good and constructive statements that have been made in connection with the proposal, and I look forward to the further consideration of the proposal here in the Folketing and will be available to answer any questions that may arise in this connection. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155955	Thank you. There are a few comments. Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407155959	Thank you, and thank the Minister for the bill, and thank you for the agreement. The excellent rapporteur from the Enhedslisten was told in the course of the debate that regional relations should of course not be subject to user charges. I think that is a very sympathetic approach to things. What is the Minister thinking? And what does the Minister think about the very, very high price charged to travellers to and from Bornholm when they have to take the ferry? I guess it's also a regional connection.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160029	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160030	Yes, and you can point to other places, such as the Storebælt link, and all of which is characterised by political agreements on it in connection with the user fee. I have the approach as Minister that I am, in effect, open to discussing all good proposals. I believe that mobility is important, and if we want islands in Denmark, and we will, and we are also concerned that there is life on the islands, then mobility is one of the most important things we can support. So I am always happy to discuss how we can ensure increased mobility, but we do have a conciliation circle where the money is also addressed, and it is clear that it needs to be taken up under it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160121	Sir. Peter Juel-Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160122	I think that's a good approach. You just have to be aware that when you have to be allowed to pay a fortune to get on a ferry to Bornholm, you also have to pay for a bridge which is significantly more expensive than the Storebælt Bridge. So I thank you for the approach taken by the Minister and hope that we can come up with something along those lines. 'Cause I hope these aren't just empty words.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160138	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160140	I always like to discuss everything and also how we support our island communities with ferry connections.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160150	Thank you. Then it's mr. Henning Hylllested, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160153	I would just like to ask the Minister whether the Minister thinks that there is a need for more cars in this country, assuming that the Minister recognises the link between extending the road network and thus creating increased mobility on the road network, which of course also means that people tend to take the car, invest in car no. 2 or for that matter in car no. 3 and thus help create the queue which is a nuisance to our society and which costs a great deal of money every year, and then we have to invest not least in the rail network, but in public transport in general, around. And I would like once again to raise the flag in relation to the fact that the Togfonden DK has been parked by 2030 in the infrastructure agreement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160249	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160250	I recognise the need for many different forms of mobility. In some parts of the country you simply cannot live without a car there you are deeply dependent on a car and it will never be profitable to set up public transport. So there you are deeply addicted to a car. Elsewhere in the country, where there is a good expansion of public transport or where there are short distances, I hope that we can move more people on to the collective or on the short routes where it does not require an expansion of the roads, i.e. bicycles or other. So I think it is necessary that we have the approach that Denmark is different and that people are different and that therefore there is also a difference in what it is for means of transport to be used. However, I am concerned that there are fewer people, especially children and young people who cycle, and I have a strong desire to get more people to use trains on the large routes around the country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160359	Sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160400	I agree with the Minister that the issue of creating, if I may say so, commercially profitable public transport, that is to say, generating profits in public transport. There will probably be a few places in the country where you can make a bus route make a profit, and there will also be a few railway lines like Copenhagen-Aarhus, where you can make it profit, but otherwise I think it is quite limited. It also means, of course, that you have to invest in public transport in order to develop it, just as you do when you build up the road network. It is, of course, an investment in carism, and it has only to be seen that over the last four or five decades there has been a great deal of investment in carism and that, contrary to what has happened in public transport, and that is why we have had the unfortunate situation in which, on the one hand, we have many large queues on our roads, but, on Zealand in particular, we have rail traffic which has almost collapsed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160459	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160500	There is no doubt that we must make the use of public transport as attractive as possible. One of the routes on which I myself am a major user is Odense-Copenhagen, and there it is possible to drive the train in 1 hour and 11 minutes, which is why I am actually surprised that no more people are using it. Because under no circumstances can one travel the same distance by car within the same time, and that means that there are some other things we need to look at in order to ensure that more people choose what is the fastest and which is quite comfortable. And I always like to discuss with Enhedslisten how we can get more people to choose what is actually both fast and good.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160544	Thank you. No one else has asked to speak and the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Transport Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220407160555	There is nothing more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Friday 8 April 2022, kl. 10:00. I refer to the agenda set out in the Danish Parliament's website.
