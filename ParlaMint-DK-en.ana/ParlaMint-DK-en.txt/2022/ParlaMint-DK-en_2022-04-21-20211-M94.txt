ParlaMint-DK_20220421101501	The meeting is open.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421101509	The item listed as No. 4 on the agenda, can only be dealt with in this sitting with the agreement of the House. But if no one objects, I consider the consent to be granted. It's a matter of course.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421101519	Are there any objections to the promotion of this request? It's a matter of course.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421101554	The debate is closed and we shall proceed to the vote on the motion for a resolution tabled. There is one proposal. Motion for a resolution (Doc. V 67 by Bjørn Brandenborg (S), Jan E. Jørgensen (V), Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt (SF), Samira Nawa (RV), Søren Søndergaard (EL), Britt Bager (KF), Pernille Vermund (NB), Ole Birk Olesen (LA), Sikandar Siddique (FG) and Jens Rohde (KD), and voting is possible. The vote will end. In favour 101 (S, V, SF, RV, EL, KF, NB, LA, FG, ALT, Karina Adsbøl (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG) and Marie Krarup (UFG)) voted against 0, abstentions 4 (DF). The proposal for adoption has been adopted, and that concludes the question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421101652	The debate is closed and we shall proceed to the vote on the motion for a resolution tabled. There are two proposals. The vote shall be taken first on the motion for a resolution No. V 68 by Annette Lind (S), Kim Valentin (V), Rasmus Nordqvist (SF), Martin Lidegaard (RV), Christian Juhl (EL) and Katarina Ammitzbøll (KF). A vote can be taken. The vote will be taken at the end In favour of 94 (S, V, SF, RV, EL, KF, LA and FG), against 11 (DF, NB, Karina Adsbøl (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG) and Marie Krarup (UFG)), abstentions 0. It has been adopted, with the proposal for adoption No. V 69 of Susanne Zimmer (FG) lapsed and thus the request is closed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421101747	No amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? Mrs Krarup does that, outside the groups. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421101803	Thank you for the floor. This law will make it impossible to have your su with if you want to read parts of your study in Russia or Belarus. This year there are seven Danish students who do. The law will cease to have effect at the beginning of 2024. So it is not a law that affects many people, but it is symbolically important. I condemn, of course, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's unfair and criminal. But sometimes it is a good thing to try to uncover the motives of the unjust and criminal. L 159 should not be able to be voted through in an enlightened European Parliament. For although it is perhaps only a small symbolic law that must show contempt and disapproval towards Russia because of the invasion in Ukraine, it is also a law that extends cancel culture to our educational institutions and makes cancel culture part of our foreign policy. Had we done the same way in the past, we would have forbidden students to take su to studies in Islamic countries after 11 September 2001, and perhaps studies in Libyan, Iraqi, Afghan, Arabic and Iranian languages and culture would also have been affected at different times. During the Cold War, we were faced with a criminal totalitarian regime that threatened us every day, yet we had cultural exchanges and studies in the Soviet Union. It made us better able to understand what signs and what linked us. Putin's Russia is an undemocratic autocracy and the invasion is unjust and criminal. At the same time, their war in Ukraine is going badly because they have not examined the situation in Ukraine well enough. Also lack of freedom of expression and democracy has made it difficult to get unpleasant truths to the surface of Russian society and to the decision-makers in the Russian leadership. They lacked knowledge. With this small law, we are one step closer to the appearance of Putin's Russia, and cancel culture does not make a cultural or religious contrast in foreign policy go away. This only makes it more difficult to resolve because one becomes worse at uncovering what the conflict is about, since one can now only study the problem area to a lesser extent. You just wrap yourself more and more into your own prejudices and make sure you don't get out of your own echo chamber. If we want to help resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and between the West and Russia, we need to learn more about the background to the conflict, and hence also about the languages and cultures behind it. Cancel culture does not cause Russia and Belarus to sink into the sea and 150 million people to change culture. It is always tempting to be seduced by anger when it is expressed in large groups and in a just cause. But group thinking and offended feelings should not lead us to put aside common sense and judgment when it comes to a complex foreign policy complex. Remember: Denmark is not at war. Denmark does not participate in a war against Russia. If we get to that, NATO is involved, and then we're on a completely different scale, a scale where weapons can be used by a much larger caliber. I hope that is not what you want in this thing, but you can well fear it when you see how much reason and the cool calculation has been run in the landfill when you have to take a stand in this conflict. I hope that the honourable Members of this House will think again before they press green into a small law which is the symbol of an incipient crazy race that could end in the ultimate disaster. That is why I am calling on the members of the Folketing to vote against this bill and to try to keep a cool head in the future, including when it comes to a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For Denmark should not look like Putin's Russia. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102224	There are brief comments. First, it's sir. Jan E. Jørgensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102227	Yeah, interesting. What are the reasons behind the crimes that Mrs Krarup is talking about? When Mrs Marie Krarup talks about cancel culture, does it also include a desire to stop Russian gas, to want economic sanctions against Russia, to stop economic relations with Russia? Is that also what Mrs Marie Krarup calls 'cancel culture'? I would just like to say to correct a misunderstanding that no one wants the Russians to change their culture, but we are some people who want the Russians to change their president.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102301	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102303	I'm sure it would be very nice if the Russians changed the president. I do not see anything wrong in wishing to do so, but I see something wrong in trying to implement a culture of cancel in the field of foreign policy and education, which makes us stupider and makes us less able to solve a problem of foreign policy which we could actually have solved with a great deal of ease if we had wanted to get to grips with the things that led to the conflict.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102337	Sir. Jan E. Jørgensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102338	I have to say that Mrs Marie Krarup is, of course, trying to say the right thing about how she condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine, etc., but throughout the speech and through previous statements by Mrs Marie Krarup, it is very, very clear that what is going on in Russia and what is going on in Ukraine is being played down. I'm sure it would be very nice to have a new president, but I'm sure it would be very good to get rid of Putin. No, it's absolutely crucial that we get rid of Putin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102413	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102414	The fact that I am now on the platform is precisely the expression that I am not trivialising it. I do not think that the fact that in a moment we can stand on the brink of nuclear war is a funny little trifle. I think it is quite serious and I think it is fatal that we go so far with our eyes open. Many people have compared this situation with the situation before World War I, where you stumbled into something that you then regretted bitterly. I hope the same thing will not happen here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102447	Sir. Rasmus Jarlov, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102449	When Mrs Marie Krarup said that the proposal here would lead Denmark to remind of Putin's Russia, I had doubts whether it really meant that Mrs Marie Krarup would vote in favour and now it is not to make this a very long debate, but I have to say that I find it embarrassing that there is a member of the Folketing who is constantly busy blaming the conflict with Russia on the side of the West and Denmark when there is such a one-sided and unnecessary attack by Russia on a peaceful country which poses no threat to Russia. There is no excuse for that, there are no extenuating circumstances, and it is not the fault of the West. I find it sad to see the personal deroute that Mrs Marie Krarup is taking here, where she keeps locking herself to a ship that is going down and that there is no justice behind it. So I would urge Marie Krarup to stop constantly defending Russia.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102551	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102552	If sir... Rasmus Jarlov believes that it is a defence of Russia to say that a criminal and unjust invasion has taken place and that the country lacks knowledge in certain areas, and that we risk ending up looking like Putin's Russia in many areas, if we vote in favour of this bill, then I think that Mr. Rasmus Jarlov has to go back to first class and learn the Danish language from the beginning, because it doesn't add up very well. Sir. Rasmus Jarlov's attempt at a personal squeezing of me doesn't seem to me to belong in any place. We have freedom of expression in Denmark. As a member of the Folketing, I can go to the platform and say what I mean, even though most people will vote for this. But that makes it all the more important that there are some who dare say when we are on the wrong track, even if it is a lemminge effect and a squeezing of those who do not follow the lemminge stream.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102700	Thank you. Then it's mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102703	Mrs Marie Krarup is relaying the threats of nuclear war by Putin and Russia if we defy Russia and Putin, and I understand that this is also true because it must be seen as part of this, I understand from Mrs Marie Krarup that we will not give su to students Danes who go to Belarus or Russia in the current situation. Can Mrs Marie Krarup elaborate on how the fact that we will not give su to Danes students studying in the two countries can lead to nuclear war?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102744	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102746	I have just spent 4 minutes and 20 seconds explaining that this tiny symbolic law in itself does not, of course, lead to the ultimate disaster, but that it is part of an attempt to make it difficult to obtain information and gain knowledge about a potential enemy. After the terrorist attack of 11 September 2001, reading in Islamic countries was not prohibited. During the various wars in which Denmark has participated, it has not been forbidden to take its su with you when you wanted to read in a country with which we were actually in conflict. Therefore, this is beginning to be a strange development towards making us less clever in areas where we have conflicts. That's a problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102849	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102850	When Mrs Marie Krarup communicates the threats of nuclear war by Putin and Russia, if we do things that they do not like, does Mrs Marie Krarup do so on behalf of the group of former DFs who are now meeting together, can we see in the media and who share rooms, etc., or is it only on behalf of Marie Krarup himself? Well, sir. Hans Kristian Skibby and Mrs Karina Adsbøl and Mrs Liselott Blix in other words represented by Mrs Marie Krarup's communication of Russia's threats of nuclear war?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102928	Mrs. Marie Krarup, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421102929	These are very shameless and gross accusations coming against me as if I were to pass on the views of other countries. I am making my own point of view, and I think it is a dangerous development when two powers or an alliance and a great power, both of which have a weapons, are trying to escalate a conflict. I think it is stupid and wrong, and I think the only wise and sensible thing is to try to draw attention to it when you are entering such a conflict so that you do not stumble into a war as was done in the first world war.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103006	Thank you. Mrs. Ida Auken.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103008	Now Mrs Marie Krarup opposed shameless and gross accusations. One might ask whether comparing the fact that one does not want to give su to students going to Russia with Russia's invasion of Ukraine is not gross and shameless.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103025	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103026	Where I compared it was not in relation to the invasion It is that the Russians clearly did not have their intelligence image in order. They have expected Ukrainians to be more interested in cooperation with Russia than they have proved to be. The Russians haven't gotten to what's going on. We shouldn't be as stupid as the Russians. We have to get to know what's going on. That's what I'm comparing, of course, not the invasion itself.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103054	Mrs. Ida Auken.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103055	I understand that Mrs Krarup is so well-informed that she said in her rapporteur's speech that the foreign policy problem could have been resolved with ease. Will Mrs Marie Krarup just inform the Danish Parliament of how it could easily have solved the foreign policy problem?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103112	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103113	Yes, I do. One could have entered into the negotiations that were planned before the war came, unfortunately, in December, January and February. One could have changed one's NATO enlargement plan many years ago. Of course, that is so long ago that it is not something that can be changed. But, of course, we could have entered into those negotiations. In the present situation, negotiations could be launched. We can hope that Mette Frederiksen, who is visiting Kyiv today, is on such a mission and that that is what she says we want to start, because that is what is needed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103151	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen-Nielsen, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103152	I actually took the floor to thank Mrs Krarup for putting so much emphasis on the need for us to know something about each other; that we can prevent many conflicts. That is quite right, both when it comes to the Arab, Muslim world and when it comes to Russia. Knowledge is absolutely crucial. I think it is the right of every country to say that it is not going to deal with a warring power that has attacked another sovereign country. It is every independent country as Denmark's right to say: we do not want to throw tax dollars in the direction of some studying abroad. But I think this debate has actually moved elsewhere. It has moved to the place where Mrs Marie Krarup, when asked about the things she says, makes one apologetic argument after another for why Russia has done what they have done. So, is it Mrs Krarup's sincere view that what we see now is the result of a clear equal responsibility of two parties?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103259	Thank you. Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103300	No, that would be stupid to say. You can't do that. You can never take away a criminal's responsibility, and it is criminal to make an attack war in my opinion. So you can't. But what should be done, as foreign policy actors, is to navigate in a way that does not reach situations where such a thing becomes more possible than it would otherwise have been, unless you want the war, of course. Because it may also be that you wanted it, and then you can just say congratulations to those who have made it happen. But if you do not want it, I think you have a responsibility to navigate in such a way that you at the same time defend your interests, but also avoid a war like this. And you could have done that, and there hasn't been a wish for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103349	Mrs. Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen-Nielsen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103352	I think I hear Mrs Krarup saying that the fact that we are not going to send tax dollars to someone who is going to study in Russia, in other words su, is a stepping stone towards being jointly responsible for nuclear war. Well, I'm sorry, that's a completely wild statement.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103417	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103418	That is also what I was trying to explain, namely that it is not immediately. This is the beginning of a development in which we say no to information, we say no to knowledge, and that means that we are getting worse at navigating in a world where there are complex conflicts. And that is something that, of course, in the long term can lead to wars. Compared to this war, if it comes, it's probably too late.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103444	Then it's mr. Morten Dahlin, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103447	Mrs Marie Krarup says that this is why I would like to ask Mrs Krarup: what does Mrs Marie Krarup think that Denmark, the EU and NATO should have done to avoid Russia's illegal war against Ukraine?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103511	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103513	Of course, negotiations could have been attempted. One could have tried to create the kind of security architecture that many suggested after the Cold War, and have involved Russia in some way, so that it had made sense, instead of expanding NATO and thus pushing Russia into a corner, so that they have felt threatened, which of course does not justify an invasion, but which one can of course say oneself will risk giving some unpleasant reactions. There is a great responsibility for Denmark because we have a particularly close relationship with the United States, which is NATO's leader, the leader of the West; there we could have said to the Americans: Listen, what you are doing is not very smart; try to think about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103615	Sir. Morten Dahlin, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103616	But is not the consequence of what Mrs Marie Krarup stands on the floor of Parliament's platform and now saying that Russia would have been given a right of veto over the possibility of other European countries, other democracies joining a military alliance? And does Mrs Marie Krarup really think that we should give Russia the right of veto on how Western democracies choose to join military alliances with other countries? And then a bonus question: does Mrs Marie Krarup really believe that NATO is threatening Russia?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103647	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103649	Of course, Russia should not have a right of veto. That would be foolish. And, of course, Russia must not decide who is a member of NATO. But what we have to take seriously is when there is a great power with nuclear weapons that feels threatened. Then we can say that it is ridiculous that they have that feeling, but if they feel it, we have to take it seriously, because they have nuclear weapons. There you cannot just say: Ha, ha, how stupid you are; for you are not. It's a fact if people have
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103727	Thank you. Then it is Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103729	In the Radical Left, we are voting for this law, but I think Marie Krarup is asking an important question: what does this mean for what we are going to know about each other? And that's why I just want to say thank you. Although we disagree with our view of Russia, I think it is important for Marie Krarup to ask the critical questions. So thank you for doing so today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103754	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103756	Well, thank you so much. This confirms a very positive impression I have always had from the rapporteur in this area. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103804	Then it's mr. Martin Geertsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103806	Thank you. You have to hear a lot before your ears fall off. I mean, now Mrs. Marie Krarup comes with historical references, and I am so old that I remember the Cold War. I think what Mrs Krarup is saying is a bit like the most extreme part of the peace movement in the 1970s and 1980s. It's kind of awesome whether you stick with the free world or whether you stick with the Soviet Union. They're pretty much as good about being evil. What is Marie Krarup's analysis of what the peace movement did in the '70s and '80s?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103840	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103842	There's Mr. Knox. Martin Geertsen saw with a very widespread misunderstanding which it is good to get rid of. The Soviet Union was a Communist dictatorship. Communism is a universal ideology that can spread all over the world. The Soviet Union wanted to spread this ideology to the rest of the world, and the Soviet Union was expansionist and the Soviet Union was about as strong as NATO. Today we have a Russia that does not have a universal ideology that does not have an expansionist ideology and that has an economy the size of South Korea. It is a completely different place, so there are two completely different things involved. But people are very sighed into the cold - war thinking; they haven't gotten to the facts of the iron industry. Very many people, including e.g. Former Minister for Defence, continues to use the word Soviet Union instead of Russia when we talk about Russia today. And that's a problem. Then be updated.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103947	This is a debate which is of great concern to many people, but we must also have respect for the debate on voices. Here you go, sir. Martin Geertsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421103956	Well, I think that what Mrs Marie Krarup is saying here actually reinforces my perception that this is an echo from the 70s or 80s. It is like hearing the extreme part of the peace movement; it does not really matter whether it is the United States or the Soviet Union, it is really one great thing. I would just like to ask Mrs Krarup what it is that Putin is doing in Ukraine if it is not spreading some idea that you have some superiority over countries that are just around you. It's just like the Soviet Union.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104028	Thank you. Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104029	I just think it's sad that sir... Martin Geertsen hasn't come to terms with history. There is a difference between a Communist great power and a much, much smaller power, which is what we have today with Russia, which does not have a universal and exportable ideology, but of course wants a Monroe doctrine with friendly countries around it. But that is what the great powers very often want, like the United States of course, where they do not accept that neighbouring countries are members of enemy alliances.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104108	Thank you. Then it is Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104111	I would also like to thank the rapporteur for two things. Firstly, I think it is a good thing that we are raising doubts in this debate and not taking too automated decisions. It is true that we need to know more about each other, but what we should not do is to support the regimes in Belarus and Russia. That's why we're voting for this bill, because we can't help more Danes supporting those regimes both directly and indirectly. We then need the Russian and Belarusian people to come to us to get to know our freedom and our values, and we can continue to do so. I would like to ask the rapporteur to confirm that. I would also like to ask the rapporteur to confirm that hopefully we will work towards getting more people for human development with people who can come to Denmark from Belarus and Russia to get to know our culture. Secondly, I would also like to thank you for making it quite clear why it is so important that we are now, on the part of all the other parties, the rapporteur, outside the groups, united in condemning the indictment of the not communist but fascist regime in Russia.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104216	Thank you. Then we'll get the answer. Mrs. Callesen, it was a lot over time. Here you go, Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104223	But I fully understand the concern that you think you can support a regime that you do not like by giving su to people who go out there. It is of course a concern, but I think that the benefit of getting some people who actually know something about the areas is greater. I think it is a pity that Russian and Belarusian students will not be accepted any more in Denmark, because cooperation has also been stopped there, just as cooperation with cultural institutions has been stopped. It has been suggested that private cultural institutions should not receive Russian writers, musicians, artists in every field. So I think it is very, very sad, and I think it is, as I said before, an unfortunate development in an enlightened European country that we are in this way opposed to being enlightened, but I fully understand the concern that we are going to support regimes that we do not like, it is entirely legitimate, but information is more important in this area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104330	Mrs. Anne Sophie Callesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104331	Thank you. There is no ban on Russians and Belarusians coming to Denmark. Some institutions have chosen to pursue a particular policy, so I would like to ask the rapporteur to confirm that. And then I just want to say again that what we distance ourselves from is not Russians and Belarusians, but governed in those countries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104348	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104350	The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education have stopped cooperating with student exchanges. It is not the case that Russian and Belarusian students have been repatriated this semester, but they cannot return after the summer holidays. So there's an end there. And there are a lot of people in cultural life who have been rejected, Russian musicians have not been allowed to play concerts in Denmark, because there has been this call for you to decide whether you think it is okay now that there are Russians here in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104424	Thank you. Then it's mr. Jacob Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104426	Is it Mrs Krarup's view that it would be a good idea if the Danish Government approached our friends in Sweden and Finland and asked them not to apply for membership of NATO because it could provoke Russia?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104443	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104444	I think that our Scandinavian neighbours should make that decision themselves. I don't think we should get involved in this. Where we in Denmark have failed very much is that we have not tried to influence the Americans where the fatal decisions to expand NATO were taken. We could have made a difference there because we have such a close relationship with the United States. We have Greenland, which makes us very, very important for the whole NATO alliance. We could have influenced the Americans there. In this resolution, I do not think there is any reason why we are trying to interfere. But I would also like to say that we have come so far that, if we may say so, it does not matter whether they are accepted or not, because we now have a very, very acute situation. We have a situation like the Cold War, and let us hope that it continues to be cold.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104544	Sir. Jacob Jensen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104545	So it is the situation that determines whether or not a country can decide whether or not to be a member of NATO. So if the situation does not allow it, Mrs Marie Krarup says that Ukraine should not be given the opportunity to apply for membership of NATO. Is that how I'm supposed to understand it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104604	Mrs. Marie Krarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104605	Yes, you have to take stock of what is happening, and it is clear that inviting Ukraine into the NATO alliance has been a very, very big mistake. It has been very ill-thought out, and that is why we are facing this terrible problem today. But it can then be said that once that problem has arisen, additional countries can enter the alliance, because now we have got the sharpening situation that NATO had so far been created to avoid, but which has now arrived.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104639	Thank you to Mrs Krarup. There are no more brief comments. I should like to know if anyone else wishes to speak. As this is not the case, we shall proceed to the vote.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104649	The final adoption of the draft law shall be put to the vote and a vote may be taken. The vote will end. In favour 105 (S, V, SF, RV, EL, KF, DF, NB, LA, FG and UFG) voted against 1 (Marie Krarup (UFG)), abstained 1 (ALT). The bill has been passed and is being sent to the Prime Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104714	No amendments have been tabled. Does anyone wish to speak? As this is not the case, we shall proceed to the vote.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421104727	The final adoption of the draft law shall be put to the vote and a vote may be taken. The vote will end.

ParlaMint-DK_20220421105010	The debate is open. Does anyone wish to speak? The Secretary of State does. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421105023	Thank you for that, President. I would like to thank you for your very broad support for the motion for a resolution. With the adoption of the resolution, Denmark will be able to make military contributions available to NATO at short notice, if requested. The motion for a resolution is therefore an important signal to our allies that Denmark is ready to deliver once again. This applies, in particular, to our significant contribution to Latvia, which will be sent out in the coming weeks, and it is a clear signal of solidarity to the Baltic countries that we take their security seriously. We are in a situation of security policy now, and it is absolutely fundamental in such a situation that NATO is united in responding to any threat to our territory. We have already had the debate today, I could hear. NATO is, after all, a defence alliance that defends free democratic sovereign states against aggression, and it is an alliance that has served us well on the Danish side since 1949, that is to say for nearly 73 years, and I think it is important to emphasise here that Ukraine and the unprovoked, illegal war of aggression carried out by Russia, the brutality we see in Ukraine by Russia, are a reminder of how important NATO is, how important our cooperation is and that we must never take that cooperation for granted, and that each of us in the situation we are in the West must ask ourselves: what can we as countries contribute to in order to create security, to ensure that any country in the alliance can live peacefully with their neighbours with respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity? So with the adoption of the resolution today, it is proof that Denmark will contribute substantially and in good time to NATO's common defence and deterrence, and I again welcome the broad support. I think it is important that Denmark here, not least in relation to our own neighbourhood, the Baltic countries, also takes the lead and takes a huge responsibility. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421105227	Thank you to the Secretary of State. There are no brief comments, and the Minister for Defence has asked to speak. Here you go, the Secretary of Defense.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421105234	Thank you for the floor, President, and thank you to Parliament for your broad support. All those who have had the opportunity to have the seat and office that I now have as Secretary of Defense have stood here every time Danish soldiers were sent out and said what I intend to say now. It is of incredibly great value that the Folketing gathers in such a broad majority when it comes to sending Danish soldiers to even more difficult parts of the world. We send a lot of soldiers, we send a lot of equipment, we send them off with a great responsibility, a great commitment and a great handshake from a broad majority in the Folketing that you have our support, that we are proud of you. And the values that you are now sent out to fight for, we trust that you fight for, and do so with pride and with the support that you experience from the Folketing today. Thank you for your support for the Folketing, and in the light of the debate that has taken place, I also feel, not least for the sake of our soldiers, that there is a need to clarify a few things which are the basis for the broadcast in question. Europe is under pressure now. Europe is under pressure, and Putin's Russia has shown its willingness to break completely with the international rule-based agenda, and the horrific acts and reports of recent weeks by Ukraine on the killing, rape and plundering of the civilian population show that the Russian forces have only contempt for the values on which we base our free society. It should be clear to everyone now that Russia is not clouding any means in its behaviour and that the values underlying Russia's actions in Ukraine are not compatible with democratic and our democratic principles It is Russia alone that bears the blame for the tragedy that is taking place in a few hours' journey from Denmark now. The suffering that Russia and Putin's regime are now imposing on a free country such as Ukraine, a free population, is suffering that no one deserves. It is Russia's alone that is responsible for this. And there is no doubt that with the broad decision we are making in this Parliament today, we very, very clearly show that Denmark is united with our European and transatlantic allies against Russia's unacceptable aggression. We are a core alliance in NATO and it is only natural that we should contribute to the strengthening and construction of NATO towards the east, because the deterrence of Russia is necessary and the need for it has increased with the atrocities that we can see Russia inflicting on Ukraine. We do so both because it is right to do so and because it is also important to remember that Denmark's own security is conditional on our working with our partners and allies in defence of our common values. So, in conclusion, I would just like to say that with the adoption of the resolution here today, a broad majority in the Danish Parliament is sending out a clear signal that Denmark is ready to assume the necessary responsibility, which is also expected by a credible ally in NATO such as Denmark. And the defense is ready to carry out the task, because as early as tomorrow, the defense will begin deploying equipment and vehicles from this battle battalion, which must go, and which will be ready to join NATO command in Latvia from the beginning of May. So once again, thank you to our soldiers for taking that responsibility, thank you to the Folketing for the broad support. It is an important signal that we are sent to our soldiers that we are proud of the struggle they are taking on and the effort they are making for the values we spend time every day in this Things to unfold. Thank you for the floor.

ParlaMint-DK_20220421110136	We'll continue the meeting. The debate is open. Sir. Orla Sea, Social Democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110153	Thank you for that, President. In recent years, the economy and economic systems of individual countries have shown to be vulnerable to trends and to quotes • modus operandi in the area of credit distribution and accountability to the long-term economic interests of countries and citizens. L 71 is an initiative which focuses on strengthening the resilience of banks and mortgage institutions by applying common rules on this within the European Community. No one, except short-term speculators, has an interest in national economies becoming seriously unbalanced by taking unnecessary risks to others' money through leverage of loans or by taking risks completely out of line with common security and common sense. Had these principles been applied in 2007, many countries would have been spared financial crises that seriously exposed the vulnerability of the increasingly connected global economy and left huge bills to countries. There is therefore no doubt that a set of well-worked rules that protects against misdirections in the global economy is both sensible and appropriate. It is one part of L 71 which is a draft amendment to the law of the Faroe Islands, and since the Faroe Islands have chosen to be outside the EU, such decisions must be made by law and not by compliance with common EU rules, as in the case of Denmark. L 71 must be further legalised by the Faroese laying before it can enter into force. However, we have great faith in our Faroese compatriots in this context. I have now referred to one part of the legislative proposal, namely the creation of a protection against unnecessary risks. There is also the other side of the coin: changes in the existing capital requirements rules and the introduction of a number of standards by the Basel Committee. The second part of the regulation aims to support the financial and mortgage institutions in continuing to lend to businesses and individuals in crisis situations, such as the Covid-19 crisis, and in the subsequent recovery of the European economy. For, of course, a society must provide opportunities for loans for new initiatives to strengthen employment, growth and the economy. Thus, L 71 will go on two legs in financial terms and for the benefit of both safety and foresight. Social democracy supports L 71.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110439	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we move on to Mr Beazley's report. Bertel Haarder, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110450	I fully agree with Mr Seligman. Orla Sea's justification for the three EU regulations that are the basis of the legislative proposal we are debating. Therefore, I do not want to repeat what he said, but simply emphasise that, when the Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union, we have to introduce the rules applicable in Denmark into the Faroe Islands by law in the Folketing and in the Faroese Laying. This is beneficial for the Kingdom community, and it is beneficial for the financial institutes in the Faroe Islands, which thus have the same opportunities as in the other EU countries. It is about strengthening the resilience of mortgage banks, increasing financial stability and supporting credit intermediation, growth and employment. The second regulation supports the activity of money lending institutions in the context of the corona crisis and subsequent recovery, and the third regulation deals with defaulted exposures, in which the regulation strengthens institutions' resilience to negative shocks and reduces the need for public intervention. In the Left we think it is very important that we have the same rules in the Faroe Islands as in Denmark. This is beneficial for trade within the Kingdom Community, and it gives the Faroe Islands better conditions for managing internationally. That's why I'm going to say hello to you, too. Edmund Joensen and the Sambands Party, who welcome the fact that with this bill we are helping to create uniform rules in the Kingdom Community. It is quite natural that it only comes into force when the Minister decides, because it must be adopted in the Latting before it comes into force. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110702	Thank you, sir. Bertel Haarder. There are no brief comments, which means that we can move on to the next rapporteur, Mrs Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110721	I do not have much to add, because my two colleagues before me have explained the bill so well. After all, we can all only support the fact that we will have a more robust financial sector also in the Faroe Islands. So, of course, SF also supports the bill. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110739	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means, as I see it, that we are moving on to Mr Beazley's report. Christian Juhl, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110802	If the Faroe Islands consider this to be beneficial to the Faroe Islands, then we support the proposal. And I appeal for the Latting to be given the opportunity to deal with the proposal freely and unequivocally before we finally adopt it. As we have promised the other two sides of the empire, we are not just making legislation over their heads without waiting for them to work in parallel with this. And to the extent that the Faroe Islands feel stronger in these funding areas, we therefore support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110846	Thank you, sir. Christian Juhl. And that means that we move on to Mr. Rasmus Jarlov, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110858	Thank you. As far as I am concerned, there is not much to add. We think it is a good thing that Faroese banks also have the same requirements that apply to Danish banks and other European banks, as it would probably be a good thing for them to have confidence that they will live up to the same conditions. So, of course, we support that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110919	Thank you, sir. Rasmus Jarlov. There are no brief comments, and that means that we are now on to Mr Beazley's report. Dennis Flydtkjær, Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110926	I'll be brief, too. The content of the bill has been well described, and the content has also been implemented in Danish law, so it is just to have it implemented also in the Faroe Islands and give them the same opportunities and security in their banks and financial institutions. We support this on the part of the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110943	Thank you. I do not see any more rapporteurs who have asked to speak, and that is why it is now the Minister for Industry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421110954	Thank you very much for your comments and for the broad, overall positive reception of this bill. The aim of the draft law is to bring into force three regulations which amend the Capital Requirements Regulation. The Capital Requirements Regulation has been put into force for the Faroe Islands by law, and with this bill we then ensure that rules apply to the Faroe Islands, which, of course, adapted to Faroese circumstances, continue to correspond to the rules applicable in Denmark under the amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation. This is appropriate, as the Faroe Islands and Denmark in the financial field are practically in union with each other. For the sake of both financial stability and confidence in the Faroese banks, it is therefore important that the rules and supervision applicable to the Danish banks, etc., also apply to the Faroese banks. A healthy, stable and well-functioning financial sector is a prerequisite for confidence in the economy and for the sector to offer financing to businesses and households on good and competitive terms. A uniform regulatory and supervisory system is also important in relation to the terms with which Faroese institutes will be met in the international financial markets when capital and liquidity are to be provided there. The law will strengthen the resilience of credit institutions and increase financial stability, while at the same time helping to limit the build-up of defaulted loans by ensuring that banks write down in good time and sufficiently on precisely defaulted loans. It is therefore important that financial legislation in the Faroe Islands is generally updated. In this connection, I would very much like to sign from here for a good and constructive cooperation with the Faroese authorities, and at the same time I am pleased that they heard parties in the Faroe Islands have generally welcomed the bill, which I can inform Things has been through second reading in the Faroe Islands without comments, and it is therefore expected that it will soon be adopted in the Faroe Islands. So in those words, I just want to look forward to the further examination of the bill here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111224	Thank you, Minister. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Faroes Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111238	The debate is open. Sir. Orla Sea, Social Democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111249	L 163, Accounting Act. The only title of the bill will easily sound a little dusty and maybe a little dull. Therefore, there is reason to look down behind the intentions with the proposal and with the content. We must reduce the administrative burden on business. This is perhaps one of the most widely used sentences in the political debate. Parliament has taken initiatives to achieve the objective of reducing administrative burdens. As far back as 2011, the Financial Statements Act came, and Denmark has become increasingly digitised, and it offers opportunities to comply with the desire for more time for the core tasks of companies: to develop, produce and sell its products. In these processes there is a lot of IT power and good for it, as it frees manual processes that can be transferred to other tasks. In a society with low unemployment and high demand for labour, it is crucial that we are aware of how we can use technology in industry and society. Fortunately, the population is highly IT-ready and uses this in their everyday lives. Businesses are well aware that in order to reap the benefits of using IT solutions, they must also invest in them. This is precisely the background to L 163. As a society, we are demanding the use of new technology that can shift administrative resources to core tasks. It has been the content of the agreements of 2022 and 2021 that the government has concluded by a majority here in the Folketing. By automating the administrative processes of companies invoicing and reporting, major administrative burden reductions can be implemented. When public authorities demand the use of technology, incentives are also provided to develop smarter, faster and cheaper solutions for businesses to meet this. It is therefore not only good for the interaction between the authorities and the companies; it is also good for the development of technology in society. Yes, and then there is a total net saving of up to 2.9 billion. kr., and I guess it's worth bowing down too. For the Social Democratic Party, there is no doubt that dust is the bill on bookkeeping. It is to a large extent an expression of modern business policy focusing on development and orderly relationships in the interaction between authorities and business. We are sincerely pleased that the agreement behind this bill contains parties across the blocks in this Chamber, and then we believe that those who argue against the proposal are convinced that it is not sensible that it is the slowest sailing ships in a convoy that are speeding up. We must dare to speed up the pace for everyone. S supports L 163, and I should like to welcome from the Enhedslisten and say that they do.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111616	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Rasmus Jarlov, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111619	I am afraid that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has got its necks wrong, which is the pros and cons of business. It is not an advantage for business to be forced to use a system that you do not want to use. The accounting systems now required for small businesses cost a minimum of DKK 250. a month. There are some free versions, but they're incredibly bad, so no one wants to use them, and the systems you're going to use in practice cost those 250 kroner. a month for small enterprises. That's 3,000 kroner. a year. That's quite a lot of money for a company that may be translating 300,000 kroner. in a year that they now get a bill of 3,000 kroner. If you are a small company with a turnover of DKK 300,000 and may have ten annexes a year because you have very few customers and some large settlements, then it does not make sense that they should now be forced to use a large and expensive accounting system which costs them DKK 3,000. a year. This is not a burden relief. This is a huge burden on a great many companies, which the government is about to impose on them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111725	Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111727	We can look at that so differently. In other words, I have a positive view of this in relation to the fact that the use of technology benefits both public authorities and companies. Then we can always discuss the size of the investments that are made, but since it is an operating cost in the company, I think you can also find deductions that ensure that the 300 DKK. do not go all the way to the full. So I disagree vertically with the Conservatives that we must speed up the pace of slow sailing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111800	Sir. Rasmus Jarlov.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111802	Try to decide how it is not a burden for the company with a turnover of DKK 300,000, which has ten annexes per year, that you are required to use an accounting system that you do not need and which costs them DKK 3,000. a year. Try to elaborate on how it should not be a burden on such a small company.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111825	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111826	Well, of course it is a burden, but of course we also have to see it in this context where, in order to reap the benefits, we have to bring everyone along, and this is one of the costs. I very much hope that newer and smarter systems will be developed which are both cheaper and equally effective. We're gonna give the ball the chance to innovate in this whole area, too. So I am sure that the skilled business community we have will find solutions that will enable us both to rationalise and to make up for the gains for both the public and private sectors.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111903	Mrs. Mona Juul, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111904	Thank you. And thank you to the rapporteur. Did I hear the rapporteur say that it might be that this turnover limit of DKK 300 000? could change, or did I hear it a little too positive?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111916	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111918	I have not taken a position on the limits of the bill. But, of course, we are interested in having a serious discussion in the Committee on Industry on the issues raised. But I cannot stand here and promise that we are prepared to change the limits that are now in force.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111936	Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111937	But why is it that the rapporteur has not taken a position on the borders? Well, the exact limits are extremely important in this bill. 300,000 kroner. is actually a very, very low limit in my opinion. Why has the rapporteur not taken a position on this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111949	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421111951	Well, there is. Well, we come here and back up about 300,000 kroner. as part of the bill. But we never refuse to discuss it on a factual basis in our committee's work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112003	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no further brief comments, and that means that we will move on to Mr Van der Klaauw's report. Torsten Schack Petersen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112010	Thank you. The draft law contains two parts, and it arises from two different agreements. The first part we're in from the left side. It was an agreement we made last June on strengthened audit for selected companies. And there is always a balance in terms of burdening companies in relation to auditing, but of course also in relation to ensuring that there is compliance with rules and no one cheats on the scales, so law-abiding companies experience unfair competition. And what the agreement is about, and what the bill implements, is among other things. a requirement for an auditor's report for 11 risk industries identified by the Danish Business Administration and the tax administration. There will be an increased audit obligation for some companies with large balance sheet totals, which are currently exempt, and then there will be an increased risk-based control, which will allow for the imposition of audit obligations if, for example, the management has violated money laundering rules or is in bankruptcy cartels, or if there are significant errors and deficiencies in accounting. Then there is also an element about stricter requirements for the storage of accounting material and greater fines for disposing of its accounting material. I think it is shameful to see that there are a large number of bankruptcy companies where it is the case that when the curator comes in and has to try to get an overview, yes, the accounting material is gone. And that's not something you're going to do about a coincidence. And that means that it is quite, quite difficult for the curator to assess whether the rules have been complied with. This makes it very, very difficult to follow the cash flows, and of course it also makes it difficult to punish those who have been responsible for the company if the evidence has been taken in the port. And it simply challenges my view of the law that it has been so little punished to be able to carry out such a deliberate act of such great importance, so it was also one of the wishes of the Left when we negotiated this agreement that the penalty for disposing of its accounting material had to be lifted. As I said, it is a matter of finding a balance between controls and burdens, and that is why the agreement we reached last June also contained some reductions to ensure that we did not impose additional burdens on companies. This meant, among other things, that we abolish the cash rule in business transactions. We have dealt with this in another legislative proposal, but it comes from that agreement to ensure that things were balanced. And the second relaxation is then in the reporting dates applicable to the Danish Business Authority and the Danish Tax Office respectively. Now there is a coincidence between the dates and this reduces the trouble for companies. So we thought it was a good and balanced agreement that we reached June, and that is why we naturally support that part of the bill. The second part of the bill concerns digital accounting, and that is then part of the government agreement of January, of which the Left is not part. The other day we had an act in the Finance Committee, which provided funding to initiate the IT work to be done, and there I had called the Minister for Industry in consultation, because, like the bill, the act also said that there was a major economic slowdown of 3 billion. kr. We discussed that; how much team there was in that equation. And I am quite sure that this is something we are going to pursue, including during the committee work on the legislative proposal here. And I can also see that some of the consultation answers are somewhat critical of whether the relaxation is so great. A key element of the consultation answers is also which companies will be included in this. And that is also what was reflected in the question that was just raised earlier. I share the view that this should be an advantage for companies and when you look at them. a. SMEs Denmark's consultation response, there is of course a great concern as to whether this proposal will provide an administrative relief or whether it will create a burden because companies have more expenditure and operating costs and implementation costs than the gains that can be reaped. So there is no doubt that we have to go along with this proposal here and we are generally happy with the digitalisation process, so it is important that it reflects which companies are covered, so that it is something that pays for them and that it does not become an annoyance and a burden. This will certainly be crucial for the Left in the further examination of the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112517	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, which is why we move on to the next rapporteur, Mrs Lisbeth Bech-Nielsen, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112533	As has already been said from the platform, this bill translates two parts. One is an agreement from last summer, and the other is about what has been discussed most in recent days and weeks at least, namely a digital accounting system. The government has set a limit of DKK 300,000. a year, and for us in the SF it may be very fine, but we would like to have bored it out a little more • we do not have a bad attitude towards it. However, I would like to say that in the last 10-11 years, at least, when I took part in this discussion, we have talked over and over again about the fact that, even when it comes to very small businesses, we need some security, some digitisation and some traceability. As the limit on when, for example, has been lowered in the past. We have also seen that there have been a lot of problems with it. I believe that at one point there was an investigation which showed that half of all companies were wrong, deliberate and unintentional. So that's too much, too much. I fully recognise the burden that it would be for some companies to have to get a system of this kind, but I think it should be seen as a whole. It is incredibly easy to start and run a business in Denmark • Time and again we are appointed to be the easiest country in the world to start a business in; there has been debureaucratisation in a wide range of areas. I think it is a reasonable requirement that digital traceability should be provided, as I actually think the rapporteur from the Liberal Group presented very well on the platform. And when the price bed, like Mr. Rasmus Jarlov explained, is about 3,000 kroner. a year, I think it's fair. In this connection, it can be said that there has been little attention from some of the parties criticising this, that is to say, that we often pay DKK 100000-15,000. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. There hasn't been much focus on that. Sometimes the price is even higher. After all, the SF has proposed, and the Minister for Industry has also proposed that we should now make it a right, so that we should not demand more than that. So we have to see our business policy in a single whole. There are some things we are calling for, which also require some of the operators, and at the same time there are a number of areas where we have made it easier for us to be businessmen for many years. We would very much like to drill into some of these things in the bill, but overall we support it on the part of the SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112834	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112838	That's the business account thing. I think it's good that you move that too. But it's just that it's not true that it's compulsory with a business account to get it if you can register as a sole proprietor company today. It's just to get that clear. And that's about the mistakes in companies. Because I fully agree with the fact that there are a great many accounting errors, but as the statement also showed, many of them are unintentional. These are some people who are not committed on purpose. What does SF have of suggestions on how to get rid of it? Because that is based on us and the official work and the rules that we impose on companies so that they can better submit these accounts?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112917	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421112918	I think I said otherwise it was at least a mistake on my part that it is difficult for many to operate today without a business account. It is true that for some it can be done. I don't think I said mandatory. But it is true that a great many of these mistakes come because of some ambiguity and some uncertainty. Therefore, there is even more reason to ensure counsel and guidance, and if innocent mistakes are made, you do not bring the great hammer, quite clearly. But that is also one of the reasons why we in the SF have been actually advocating for several years that we think that the audit limit should be set in order to be able to get an audit, not necessarily the large, full, expensive package that we are demanding from large companies, but a light model, so to speak. Because auditing shouldn't just be seen as someone coming after you. It should also be seen as there is some professional help to avoid some of these mistakes that many will unwittingly commit.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113020	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113021	I agree, but I am not sure that the duty to audit is the right one. Because no matter how light you do it, I don't think you get under this $15,000, which we also remember was set as a minimum during the corona period. 15,000 kroner. In a small start-up company, therefore, a lot of money is needed if you are to have a digital accounting system and everything else at the same time. One of these areas is for example: VAT. There are two different VAT rates for how much you can deduct from VAT, depending on whether you are out eating with a customer or you are out eating yourself or all sorts of things. There are such crazy, foolish differences. Is that some of what the SF would like to look at? Let us now have it straightened out so that we can sort out such a small, insignificant thing as a VAT refund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113100	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113101	This is an exciting discussion. Unfortunately, we do not have much time, because I would really like to discuss deduction. I think we have far too many deductions in Denmark. I would like us to have it sunk very, very roughly and used that revenue to provide a general relief to the business community. I'd like that. I think that deduction both opens up for those in bad faith to abuse it in a large way. I think it exists out there and it also opens up a mase error and trouble and administration etc. I'd like us to remove a lot of these deductions and use the proceeds and send it back.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113138	Thank you. Mrs. Mona Juul, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113139	Thank you. And thank you to the rapporteur. To the end, I want to say that it will be really exciting, because I kind of agree that just this simplistic tax system will be a relief in itself. Now Rasmus Jarlov mentioned earlier in a question an expense of about DKK 3,000. For license, but there's an investment before. Does the rapporteur also recognise this, so that there is indeed an investment in getting a system in relation to starting up at all on this before you have to pay an annual licence?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113207	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113208	That's where I get the questioner's answer guilty, 'cause I thought when you had the system, it was from this 250 kr. a month and up, that the costs were.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113220	Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113222	I think it is, but there is a system investment from the start, which may be 15,000 kroner, and that is the investment that should also be added. But will the rapporteur help to look at the turnover limit? Will the rapporteur help to see whether there can be other criteria that we should throw in, in relation to when to join and when not to join? It could, for example, be done. be number of invoices. If you only have a 20-25 invoices, it may be a little excessive to invest 15,000 kroner. in a system that you also need to have a license for, which costs 3,000 DKK. a year.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113248	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113249	We are very open to see if we can move a little on some boundaries. I was just saying that I think we're near where we're going to end up, but we're open to seeing if we can move a little. Number of invoices could also be a good bid • it makes good sense. Then I would just like to say, in order to end it with the deductions, that I think we should take down such a minimum view of deductions, where we say that what is compulsory, for example. a digital accounting system, you can subtract. But compared to the stuff about eating and equipment and everything, I'd like us to just shave it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113324	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no further brief comments, which means that we will move on to Mrs Katrine Robsøe, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113335	Thank you. There have been very fine reviews of the draft law here, which is of course made up of two different agreements, and both agreements are, after all, radicals included in and supported. And then I would like to start by asking whether everyone else could also be involved in getting a technical review of this bill, in particular that part of the bill which deals with the digital accounting obligation. At least I could really use that. And now comes the reason why I could really need it in this context. That is because there are some concerns, at least the answers to the hearings, in relation to the limit set at DKK 300 000, and these are some concerns that I can well follow, and one that was not included in the political agreements either. And then when these concerns come up, I could use a completely technical review of why the government and this bill have set the limit there and thus have a slightly more enlightened basis to take the discussion on, in terms of whether it should be lifted. At any rate, I think that there are some good arguments for this in the light of the answers to the hearings. But I think I also need to see how many companies this is about, depending on where you set those limits. What is the cost to them, both at start-up costs, such as Mrs Juul? asked about, and also with current expenditure. I think that could be a really good thing to get in here. After all, even when I read the Minister's address to the bill here, the aim is to lighten the burden. We in the Radical Left really want to be a part of that. I can see that there are a lot of people who also think that they are being burdened. I would also like to make sure that we do not get a lot of new burdens on relatively small businesses and that they have a good opportunity to run their business in the future too. There are also some other concerns in the consultation answers beyond the limit of the DKK 300,000, among others. This concerns the number of data to be stored by third parties and the security of it and of the requirements raised in relation to whether this would distort competition with regard to the providers of accounting systems. I think we have a common interest in getting as good systems as possible, and that is why I certainly need us to look at that part a little more closely. We are in radically positive, of course, towards the legislative proposal, which is also implementing two agreements that we are, as I said, in full support of. However, there are these areas of concern which we would very much like to see clarified, both if the Minister can respond to parts of it today from the platform, but otherwise in the committee's work afterwards. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113706	Thank you. There are no comments. That's Mrs. Mona Juul, because I understand that Mr. Rune Lund is covered earlier. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421113730	Thank you for that and thank you for the floor. Digital switch to the fight against cheating and fraud and savings for business of 3 billion. kr., wow, who doesn't want to be a part of that? It almost sounds too good to be true, so is it. That is also why, of course, Conservatives are not in either agreement behind the bill. Firstly, the political agreement of June 2021 on more review will hardly be a fight against cheating and fraud. There will be no less fraud in itself of more auditing. On the other hand, it is certainly an extra burden for the law-abiding small self-employed, a burden that, in our best opinion, is valued far too low, which we also discussed in the negotiations. After all, it is based on auditor tariffs, which neither one of them nor the other self-employed in various committees has been able to recognise. Secondly, the political agreement of January 2022 on automatic business reporting will probably provide a great and glorious burden relief, perhaps, and in the long term, and for the large companies that have not already implemented digitalisation in accounting, but unfortunately the self-employed and small businesses are being poured back down the board. The burden reduction is at the expense of small operators who do not need or need to digitise their limited accounting. That is simply not fair and I do not think it is right for them to stand up again. The limit on when you can avoid digitizing with this system is simply too low. The investment in digitalisation is never taken home and in itself becomes bothered and burdensome. As a self-employed person the other day wrote to me and now I quote: Now a ministry is again making life as a small businessman in Denmark a hell. It is quite crazy that quite small businesses, such as the United Kingdom, should be able to do so. my letter, which he refers to with three business owners and very few transactions, and which can account on the back of an A4 envelope, must be forced to acquire a digital accounting system. I'll handle my few transactions in an excelark. He continues: I think it is quite unreasonable, especially in the current situation ^ and here, of course, it is referred to postcorona ^ to impose such high additional costs as will be the case. The savings far out in the future I do not believe in, and it is pure guesswork without teams in reality. The man may be right. We can't be familiar with this. We cannot be aware that we are putting the system above small businesses. That is why I propose to be as constructive as possible that the bill should be divided into two parts, namely an auditor's part and an accounting part. Conservatives will then vote against the accountant's part. We have been against this all along, and we were also in the negotiations and tried to change it, but we are not succeeding. However, we would like to split the bill into two and vote against the auditor's part and then table an amendment to the accounting part. Because there's music in digitizing, there's no doubt about that. But it has to be an amendment which is mainly on a much higher turnover limit than the proposed DKK 300 000. We do not see where they have gone, simply. What is the reason for the $300,000?? What does it have to do with the fact that it's called 300,000 kroner? rather than, for example, 2 million kr.? We will also consider a limit for example. Numbers per year, i.e. number of invoices. We think that's just as important a limit to get a look at. In the same vein, we should also listen to the fact that the law comes into force all too quickly. So, many simply cannot reach or afford or save to invest on such short planning horizons. That is why I would like to put a number of questions in committee to make us wiser. It may also be the technical review that Radicals are proposing; something that can make us wiser on how to make a sensible amendment, a proposal that we are not just pulling out of our back pockets, but which embraces the many small companies on which Denmark is built; small companies that continue to be small because that is how it works best for them. Or small businesses that may grow big if we just allow them and do not drown them in administration. So come on, Minister, come on, Parliament, with a little change, and then we can all be together to make this proposal much, much better.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114145	Thank you. There are no brief comments here either, so we go further. It's sir. Dennis Flydtkjær, Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114154	Today we are dealing with a bill on accounting and auditing for companies. This legislation is, of course, the expression of common sense, development, optimisation and digitisation on the surface. That sounds very good, as the Conservative rapporteur also said. But it doesn't seem like we've just hit exactly right or right within the dial, as we usually say. For example, section 16 is concerned with forcing all business owners of any type to register transactions in a digital accounting system. The limit goes at 300,000 kroner. in net turnover for a two-year period, but it is, in fact, quite an intervention to force companies, especially the smallest ones, to use a digital programme to be approved by the Danish Business Authority. I am actually thinking the same thing as many other rapporteurs, because can that really be the intention? Should we not instead encourage a spirit of enterprise and efficiency, especially among the smallest operators? Shouldn't we lower the bar to run a business so that more people will want and have the opportunity to do so? Should the paper nourishment really be allowed to make an accounting in a simple excelark or on a piece of paper, if that is only what you need? We actually see a number of issues in this bill. In short, a lot of companies are doing fine accounting today. It may be a personal trainer, who has a turnover of DKK 400,000, who writes it in Excel or may get an accountant to help him out for just a few thousand dollars a year. They must now, on top of that from 1 January, digitise all annexes and invest many thousands of kroner in various digital solutions for storing these annexes. In addition, they must use a digital accounting system. That's the kind of thing that's gonna cost you. This is something that becomes bureaucratic. And you move money away from small businesses and small self-employed businesses to book-keeping system providers. In the Danish People's Party we could see a solution to that. Among other things, it could. the previous rapporteurs have also mentioned that the turnover limit was significantly increased, so that it does not amount to DKr 300,000. It could be 1.5 million. kr., it could also be 2 million. kr., but the limit certainly needs to be raised significantly so that we do not pull the carpet away under the small micro-enterprises. I think that's important. As the draft law now stands, I must say from my party that we cannot support it in its present form.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114423	Thank you. Then we move on in the rapporteur's line. Sir. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114429	We often pride ourselves on the fact that it is very easy to start a business in Denmark. We're proud of that. And so is it. It is very, very simple to go into Work and set up a business. But from there it is uphill to operate in Denmark. Not only are we being burdened by a very, very heavy and hard tax system, but we are also facing a wall of administrative trouble and bureaucracy on the part of the authorities and the state. We must also have done so, because then we can no longer boast that it is good to operate in Denmark. No, it may be easy to start a business, but it is by no means easy to run a business. There we can do far more on the part of the Danish Parliament than we do at present. Digital accounting solutions are an excellent invention. Really, a lot of small businesses take great advantage of getting this automated, and it's a pleasure to see how to move focus, going from maybe spending a lot of hours on your accounting to making it much faster on the digital. But it must therefore be a matter of voluntaryness that it is something that each company decides to do for the company. This proposal requires these companies to use one of some approved accounting systems. It creates both a monopoly in this area, probably because there are not so many who offer these things, and it also means that these small entrepreneurs now have to set aside quite a lot, rather large amounts, perhaps of their total turnover into these systems. And that is by no means fair. Now a limit of DKK 300 000 has been set and, as the debate has sounded today, it is as if it has been taken out of the air a little bit. In fact, I believe that the reason why it is set at 300 000 kroner is that it is there that you can also be exempt from accountability. I think that's the way you've thought: then we'll set the line there. But I do not think that is a durable and valid argument in itself, so let us look at the border. It could also be the number of invoices. However, as the draft law now stands, I do not expect us to support it at all, nor do we expect any changes. I think it is simply an interference in the right of small businesses to run their business in the way they feel is best. So we are going to vote against.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114707	There is just one comment from Mrs Mona Juul. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114711	Thank you to the rapporteur. I just want to clarify: if the bill is split into two, if the Minister chooses it and we decide it, will New Citizens still vote for the accountant's part?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114721	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114722	We have not yet taken a final position on this. When we had it up last year, we were also opposed to the increased demands that were made, for example. the companies which were to have cash registers. It was in individual industries. We think it is sensible to take tougher sanctions when people break the rules. But as we saw, for example. with cash registers and the other with the increased bookkeeping they had to do, it was perhaps 30 per cent that could not find out, and 70 per cent that could. I am not much for these collective punishments, but I am very much in favour of harsh sanctions being imposed on those who then cannot find out if they consider that they are breaking the rules, perhaps deliberately.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114800	Mrs. Mona Juul, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114802	I agree that the sanctions are quite important in terms of cheating and fraud, because we simply do not want to have them. I don't think any parties will. But is it not true that New Citizens are part of the agreement on increased auditing, which will also affect the burden on small businesses?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114817	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114818	Yes, absolutely, and that is also why, when you are part of an agreement and the law that then comes out on the other side, you are also, of course, part of it. But as I also thought the Radicals explained very well about the agreement they were in on what turnover should be, they were DKK 300 000. not mentioned. Maybe you don't feel it's the right thing to do, so something can happen there. But I also hope that we can split up the bill. Then I would like to welcome it very, very much. But we must see if the Minister is willing to do so. At least he replied very cooperatively.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114845	Thank you. That's what we're gonna have to hear. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421114851	Thank you very much, President. Thank you for the rose, and also thank you for the debate here. I have to say that I have been looking forward very, very much to standing here today and presenting exactly this bill. And I do, because it is not every day that a single legislative proposal brings administrative relief for our businesses here in Denmark for just under 3 billion. kr. every year. It is a very clear example that digitisation and automation are tools that work that make a difference to the individual company. And we need to keep looking for and finding this kind of potential where we can remove unnecessary barriers and at the same time save businesses money. When I visit businesses around the country, some of it is the talk quickly going to fall on, exactly what we're working on here. It's bureaucracy, it's reporting, it's trouble that takes time and resources away from the core task of the company. One day takes the other; the day-to-day operation runs; administrative trouble is something that takes a really long time, time that every company I know would rather spend on their core business on operation, on development, on new market shares. Today, we are taking the first step towards breaking up with that part of the paperwork that is unnecessary. In concrete terms, we are proposing to save Danish companies nearly 3 billion. kr. per year in unnecessary working hours. We do this through increased digitisation and automation of accounting processes. It is time saved in relation to having to manually record each sale or purchase, each deposit or payment, and time saved in relation to sitting with the paper pile and comparing it with the bank statement when VAT or financial statements have to be reported. That's why this bill is going to make a big difference in everyday life in the individual company, and I guess that's what we want with the rules we're doing here. Unfortunately, we also have to say that we are at a time when we are reminded that IT security is extremely important. Unfortunately, the back of increased digitisation is that you become vulnerable if your IT system does not work or if someone from outside can break into it and steal your data. That is why it is crucial that with increased digitisation there should also be increased IT security. With the bill we are discussing here, we are also calling for digital accounting systems to meet recognised standards in the area of IT security. In this way, companies should be able to be confident that their data will be stored in a digital accounting system where IT security is in order. So even though there are a lot of advantages to this bill, I also recognise that there will be a change in our companies in Denmark. We will not get out of it, and it is also true that this is probably particularly true in the smaller companies. Providers also need to adapt their systems so that they can meet the new requirements and be recognised. And that's also why we're setting up for the launch, and it's important that we have a gradual implementation, and there are a number of ways in which we can help. The requirements will apply from 2024 at the earliest for the accounting companies and for the personally owned companies at the earliest from 2026. And then, as has also been part of the debate, we exclude the 270,000 least privately owned companies... this is the turnover limit of the DKK 300,000 that has been discussed in this Chamber. It has also been discussed with business organisations to find out where an appropriate and proper level could be set. I can listen to the fact that there is an interest in moving on that limit, because there may be some really observed companies that are small and have very few transactions at the same time, and then the profit is correspondingly reduced by creating a new system. You also need to know that there may also be a large number of companies in the same category that are small but have an incredible number of transactions, micro-transactions, in large numbers. So if you move on the border politically, you are also helping to reduce the burden relief potential behind the legislative change we are facing here. I just want you to know that. I believe that we have helped precisely the group of companies which is of particular interest and which I myself have a particular interest in, through the gradual implementation and by exempting from the DKK 300 000. And then it's part of history that at the same time we are ready with advice, and we are ready with financial support, so that companies can also seek help with the implementation of these digital accounting systems. And, of course, we will ensure that we have both business organisations, providers of systems here and relevant authorities involved in the concrete implementation of the requirements to be made, and we will set in motion a thorough guidance effort. I particularly noticed the radical rapporteur's desire to have the opportunity to dive a little more into the borders and the levels and have a talk about it, and I think the best thing would be for me to invite the rapporteurs to the Ministry of Industry so that we can both get the technical change on it, but actually also take the political talk about the border. And I am, in principle, open to discussing it; I just want to say, as I did before, that you should know when you do that, that then you also reduce the burden relief potential that Danish industry can have overall. And that's the side of the coin where we should look each other in the eye and I think we should do that. Anyway, I'd like to invite you to a meeting, and then the people who want it can show up. So much for that part. Then, of course, it is also important for me to mention that the legislative proposal contains rules designed to strengthen the fight against fraud companies, which should contribute to fewer companies making mistakes in their accounts and their declarations of VAT and tax. And that happens, among other things. know that we require an auditor to be involved in the presentation of financial statements, and it will also be possible to check new start-ups in an earlier phase, i.e. our agreement on the audit work. So all in all, this bill helps companies to avoid heavy manual processes and administrative trouble, and this means that companies can release time for their core tasks, which are development, operation, growth, or whatever they think it is best to spend time and effort on. This does not happen by relaxing controls; on the contrary, companies will be able to comply more easily and, of course, the authorities will also be able to detect fraud more easily. Against this background, I look forward both to our having a good committee work, but also to the hope that we can meet in the Ministry of Industry and have the opportunity to take a look at the technical elements, and also the more political conditions around this specific limit, which has been discussed most. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421115640	Thank you. There are brief comments. Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen, Left, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421115644	Thank you. I would like to acknowledge that the Minister has heard what has been said in the Chamber today in relation to this turnover limit. I am rather annoyed that the Minister did not listen at the hearing stage, because that is not a message that must be new to the Minister. After all, SME Denmark is very clear in its response to the consultation. But, of course, it is important that the Minister has heard what something similar to more than 90 mandates has said, and it usually also makes a minister a little more responsive. So I only have the clear question of whether the Minister is willing to look at both the turnover limit, the number of employees and the number of invoices, in relation to who is covered and who should not be covered.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421115732	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421115733	As far as the turnover limit is concerned, I think it is just necessary to record that there have also been discussions with business organisations which, in my understanding, believe that DKK 300 000. can be a real level. This is part of the picture when we discuss it, and that is why I think it is the right level that has been set. Combined with the gradual phasing-in, combined with the guidance effort, combined with financial support opportunities, I believe that we have actually hit a right level where we get a massive, great burden relief for Danish business and at the same time have a look that it can be a different everyday life when you are smaller. But there is such financial help, there is guidance, and there are other things for it. I am more reluctant to discuss this by putting in the number of transactions as a parameter, because it is at all a much more arbitrary size, and we use turnover limits in many other contexts, so I think we should look at whether it is right. I would just warn against the parties watering down the burden-reduction potential that we can give to Danish business, with the limit we have chosen, if we raise it too high. Then there was one last thing I just forgot. That was the limit, and then it was the transactions and then it was the number of employees. And there's this SME:Digital scheme where you can seek help for example. investing in IT systems, and it is my knowledge that the business organisations and participants who sit on the board of SMEs Denmark have set that limit, but I assume that you can talk to them about that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421115918	Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421115921	Thank you. I just have to understand when the Minister says that if you raise the limit, some of the burden relief, i.e. the calculated burden relief, will be reduced. In other words, if a company that has piles of transactions says that this system is simply a gift from the sky, but its turnover is below the limit that a majority in the Folketing would have to reach, then surely it is not cut off from linking to the system. And that is why it means that the companies that are being exempted, but who can see that this is a fantastic proposal, will just choose voluntarily to stamp in. I guess they're not cut off with the government's proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120001	Thank you. And here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120001-2	You can make a voluntary model and then say that you can volunteer. It may also be that you set a limit and say that above that limit everyone must be included, and below that limit you can do so voluntarily. You can work with that. However, if you do so voluntarily and there have also been business case calculations from KPMG, which have been responsible for this, then the uncertainty about the burden relief is correspondingly greater, and there is a risk that it will actually be less burden relief for Danish industry. And that is what I think we must deal with politically, including the Left and the bourgeois parties, namely whether that is what we want. I think we can get a great relief, also by helping the small ones with financial support for the investment they are going to make.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120048	Thank you. Mrs. Mona Juul, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120049	Thank you for that and thank you to the Minister. It is very constructive to call in the rapporteurs, I think, because then we will also be able to validate what lies in the 300 000. Or could there be another limit that was more appropriate? Because I think what we're out in here is kind of like when you wake up in the morning and in the weather forecast you're told there's sun all over the country, and then you find that it didn't actually apply to your own area. And it is a little the same here, that it may well happen, that on average it means that, overall, we get a greater burden relief, but if it goes beyond a group that we need, i.e. entrepreneurs, small self-employed people, very small businesses, then we can lose a lot in the long run simply by not getting them in from the start. And that is why it is really important to me that we have that discussion. So I would like to sign for that, and I look forward to it very much. My question is: will the Minister share the bill so that we can divide it into an accountant and an accounting part?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120145	Thank you, and here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120146	First of all, I would like to say about the second part of the weather forecast that, if you are so unlucky to be where it might rain that day, it may well be that it is well done that you get an umbrella, or said a little differently in connection with this bill and a little more seriously: it is, of course, taken into account exactly the companies that the rapporteurs here point to, with the few transactions and the low turnover, with financial support to invest in IT systems, that is to say help to recover the cost that will be. And it is quite true, as the rapporteur has already said, that it is a guidance effort and a gradual implementation, so it is only from 2026 that we have to deal with this system. So I think we have taken this into account and that at the same time we can deliver a total of 3 billion. crowns great burden relief potential. But we are discussing it, and it is in the constructive spirit that is called for the discussion. Whether or not we should split up the bill, I think we should have the same discussion. I also think that there are several parties that are part of the review agreement with which I would like to have the opportunity to discuss it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120251	Mrs. Mona Juul.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120252	I very much hope so, because then we can at least go in full from here to see if we can change the turnover limit on the accounting part and perhaps look at what other criteria are needed to get it out and find the right level. With regard to the choice of system, I am also a little concerned about it, and it may be that we can take it in the negotiations. But what I'm a little worried about is if the state goes in and recommends some systems. Then we must be sure that they are independent and so on, and I am sure the Minister will also be aware of that. However, what I would also like to ask is that the draft law provides for implementation at the turn of the year. I think that's very, very fast. Well, has the Minister thought twice about whether we should look at it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120338	Thank you. And here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120339	After all, there are different conditions in the same legislation, and that is also why there is a desire for a division. So some of the things will come into force from the turn of the year, the implementation of the automatic business reporting will be gradual, respectively in 2024 and 2026, starting with the different accounting classes, and that is why, if we now come to the conclusion that we are taking this draft law in two bites, I am not sure that the entry into force is a problem for the Conservative People's Party. But we need to talk about that. I myself do not think that there is a problem in dividing up the bill, but I also respect the fact that I have made an agreement with parties on both, which is why I would like to turn it around with them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120420	Thank you. Then no one else has asked for the floor and the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120433	The debate is open. Mrs. Ida Auken, the Social Democratic Party, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120450	No one can be in any doubt that the tax administration has been more easily challenged in recent years. Social democracy has led the way in ensuring better and more efficient tax administration with, among other things: eight new tax centres and 1,000 new employees. Of course, a key condition for our success with the recovery of the tax administration is that the right people can be recruited. During these years, the Ministry of Taxation is faced with a comprehensive recruitment task, and it has proved difficult to recruit employees with the right tax skills. The proposal here is intended to help remedy this problem by allowing the Minister of Education and Research to derogate from the requirement of two years of relevant professional experience after completion of qualifying training in order to be admitted to the diploma in tax. In addition, the Minister for Education and Research will be able to lay down detailed rules on admission requirements for a tax diploma. It can, for example, be done. have documented relevant employment at the time of application. Training is part of the adult education system. The Ministry of Taxation considers that this particular training will help to ensure that more new employees in the Ministry of Taxation acquire the necessary tax professional skills in a shorter period of time. We must do what we can to ensure a flexible education system so that we can train the talented heads that the labour market is looking for. Rich rules must not stand in the way of a higher level of knowledge, a well-trained population or the recovery of the tax administration, and therefore the Social Democrats support the proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120632	Thank you. There are no comments. Mrs. Ulla Tørnæs, Left, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120645	Thank you very much. I can actually be very brief: the draft law here, as we also heard from the Social Democratic rapporteur, intends to solve a rather simple problem, namely that in the next three years, the Tax Authority will recruit between 800 and 1,000 employees per year. Those employees would like to have good professional qualifications, which they can obtain through a diploma course, for example. However, the conditions for admission to the diploma programme are that you must have at least two years' professional experience and an admission-giving relevant training, typically an academy course. However, the requirement for two years of work experience ranges in far too many situations in order to meet the acute need for competent labour, such as: the tax administration needs in the context of the recovery which is currently in full swing around the tax administration. This is why the draft law provides for a temporary derogation from the requirement for the two years of professional experience so that more people can obtain more rapid access to a tax diploma. We think this is a very good thing, and we in the Left can of course support it, although we would now like to see the government being equally active in the future when there are questions of training aimed at the private sector, in other words, where there is a shortage of skilled labour. But we can support the bill, and with the private labour force we can return to it at a later stage. It is, of course, important to stress here that the diploma education in tax itself also provides access for private companies on an equal footing with public companies, but there may also be other training courses where it is more specifically the private sector that needs qualified labour, and then I hope that the government will be as responsive as it has been in the field of tax diploma education. The Left supports the bill. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120907	Thank you. We are moving forward, and this is Mrs Astrid Carøe, Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120915	Thank you. I think I will be very brief, because otherwise I will just end up repeating the points made by my good colleagues. We also think it is quite sensible to change these admission requirements to the diploma in tax. We're going to need employees with tax skills when we're going to set up these new tax centres, so SF supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120935	Thank you. And we move on to Mrs Katrine Robsøe, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421120941	Thank you. Then we'll see if we can do it almost as fast as SF. There's not much to raffle about here. Radicals, of course, also support the bill. In fact, I very much agree with what Mrs Ulla Tørnæs said about being able to act quickly if the private sector is faced with similar challenges that the tax administration is facing here, where there is a lack of professional competence. On the other hand, I also think it is quite reasonable that we have hit it and said that we now have a five-year period in which this can be done. I understand that it is the Treasury's own assessment that you will then be able to catch up with the gap in professional competence, because we have usually set a limit on the professional experience you have to have to take these diploma courses, so you have some experience that you then take into this education. It is the idea behind the training that you have some work experience and some professional skills that you have gained in the labour market that you bring into these courses. But, of course, there is a full understanding of the need to make a derogation here and, of course, radicals support it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121102	Thank you. And we move on in the rapporteur's line. Then it's mr. Bruno Jerup, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121108	Thank you. We also support the proposal for a ministerial authorisation to derogate from the rules on two years of relevant work experience. Of course, we could argue that this is a deterioration or a weakening of the level of training. I think we could argue for that too, but that does not change the fact that we believe that it is necessary to give this possible authorisation to the Minister, and then we also rely, as the comments also state, on the fact that, after completion of our diploma training and employment, we must also have a subsequent development of competence on the work that is being done in the tax administration. So in this way, like some things, there are things that can compensate for the minor weakening that is that you do not have 2 years of relevant work experience. But we support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121221	Thank you. We move on to Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen. No, I'm sorry, it's Mrs. Gitte Willumsen, Conservative. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121234	Thank you for the floor. The draft law we are discussing here today must allow us to have some skilled tax workers in the future. The proposal is that in future you can take the diploma course in tax without having two years' professional experience. Well, that's a demand today. It is actually a bit crazy; imagine that it has come so far that we have to relax the admission requirements for a tax diploma in the hope of having employees. When you read the consultation answers, you can see that everyone is practically positive about the proposal. The Danish Told & Tax Federation welcomes the proposed scheme and considers that the scheme will support the extensive transformation which is taking place in the Danish Treasury in these years, with a focus on strengthening tax professionalism. In the Conservative People's Party, we fully agree with the consultation parties. There is a need to help our tax authorities. The Danish Tax Office is facing an extensive recruitment task in these years. There is an expectation that the Danish Tax Office will recruit between 800 and 1,000 employees a year over the next three years. These are very many employees at a time when there is a general shortage of labour. For the Conservative People's Party, it is important that the levying of taxes is fair and fair. Unfortunately, there are far too many bad stories about the IRS. That is everything from tax evasion to error payments and collections. This creates distrust of our tax system, and we, as a state, cannot stand to do so. If we are to have support for the welfare state, we need support for the tax administration. That is why we support the proposal that it should be made easier to have well-trained tax workers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121427	Yeah, well, that's it, and now it's sir. Alex Ahrendtsen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121438	Thank you, President. Normally, the admission requirement for a diploma course is 2 years of relevant professional experience after completion of admission-giving training. We know that. In the Danish People's Party we recognise that our tax administration needs employees, and we probably all want the tax administration to clean up the many hanging parties they have. It takes a well-educated staff. However, we would also like to have a discussion on whether this is the right medicine, including possibly asking whether it has been examined whether there are other areas that have the same need. A diploma course is based on the fact that students have practical experience and therefore the specific diploma course should be rethought if it is to work for students without relevant professional experience. We have noted that in the hearing answer the professional high schools propose to introduce the possibility of testing new formats. It could, for example, be done. be a way to go. There is basically a need to discuss the possibilities for more flexible opportunities for continuing training throughout life. In fact, we also think that it should be involved in the discussions that we expect to have with the Minister soon on the follow-up to the recommendations of the Reform Commission. That is why we would like to see the Minister's commitment in the work of the committee on how this will be followed up. It would be nice if the Minister could say something about it. That does not mean that we do not support the bill, because we do. We will not stand in the way of the tax administration moving forward and getting a well-educated staff so that we avoid these very boring matters that we have had in recent years. So there is support from the Danish People's Party. Thank you, President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121634	Thank you. Then it's mr. Peter Seier Christensen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121640	Thank you. I am not going to repeat the content of the bill, but just say that New Citizens support it. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121648	Thank you. As there are no more rapporteurs from the various parties, it is the Minister for Education and Research. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421121704	Thank you for the debate and the widespread support for the bill. Measured by the number of pages, it is a limited amount. Nevertheless, the proposal will make a very positive difference in relation to the recruitment challenge experienced in the area of the Treasury these years. It is important for our authorities to be able to perform critical tasks in society, and this presupposes that the authorities are able to recruit qualified staff. This also applies to the tax administration, where there is an acknowledged need for recovery. I have worked a number of years in the past as a tax rapporteur and have helped to highlight the major problems that have arisen in the tax administration and also raise the demand for increased resources and increased staff in the tax administration. And on many points it has been possible to get people, but there is therefore a particularly large recruitment task in the coming years, when it has proved difficult to recruit enough staff with the necessary tax-related skills. That is why I am also pleased, as Minister for Education and Research, that with this bill we can support the need for specific tax-related upgrading of newly trained employees in the field of taxation. The Ministry of Taxation has considered that the tax diploma is particularly relevant in relation to the professional qualification of employees in the field of taxation. The aim of the draft law is therefore to make it possible to obtain more rapid admission to the diploma in tax, so that the necessary tax skills can be obtained more quickly. The draft law provides that the applicable entry requirement for 2 years of relevant professional experience after the admission-giving training may be waived, as several rapporteurs have also mentioned and repeated from the draft law. However, it is still important to maintain the close interaction between theory and practice, which is a fundamental prerequisite for training in the continuing training system. For this reason, the draft law also provides for detailed rules on admission requirements for the diploma in tax. The rules must support that all students in the tax diploma continue to achieve the required professional level, whether they are admitted to the current admission requirements or the admission requirements which the bill lays down and allows for. There will be, among other things: be required for appropriate employment at the time of application and other requirements relating to the framework and content of the employment. There will also be a requirement for an individually organised training plan for the applicant concerned drawn up by the place of employment. The proposal is not limited to employees in the territory of the Ministry of Taxation, but can be used by anyone who fulfils the admission requirements. And with the comment I just made a moment ago, it should also be a response both to Mrs Ulla Tørnæs, who is interested in the private labour market. In this case, it may be that some who need tax skills will be able to apply it and to Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen states that there are, after all, still different requirements to maintain the kind of interaction between theory and practice to give the quality of training and meaning of the way in which training is at the level of diploma education. It is proposed that the scheme should apply for five years and, as was also mentioned in the debate, it is also the number of years that the Ministry of Taxation believes it is necessary to have this derogation from the general requirements in order to be able to carry out the many recruitments they will have to carry out in the coming years. I am pleased to note that the proposal has been well and constructively taken up in the debate here and also in the hearings. Against this background, I look forward to the subsequent vote in committee and in the Folketing. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421122049	Thank you. There are no comments and that is why the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Education and Research Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421122104	I would point out that the vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until Tuesday 26 April 2022. First of all, the rapporteur for the questioners, Mrs Lotte Rod, the Radical Left, for the explanatory statement. We're gonna have to get everything straight, so we're gonna relax for a second. There's some cops coming in and helping out now with the seats. We're in place, so here you go, Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421122249	Thank you. Many children and young people in Denmark feel bad. They feel lonely, they develop anxiety and depression, and I think it is one of the most serious criticisms of our society. I believe that we in the Danish Parliament must take the lead in making a movement for recreational education where children and young people can play together, where they can immerse themselves in things that are not meant to lead a particular goal, where it is not the adults who decide or control where they are not to perform, but where they can actually just forget themselves and be part of a larger community. When children play, they imagine things that they can't yet, they fall and beat themselves, they get up again, they have to try again, and when they play, they have to negotiate with each other, they make friendships with each other, and they are happy because the game is meaningful in itself. And when children play, they are in a wonderful, endless time when they are not guided by being on their way to something else, but where they are just driven by an inner desire and motivation. And we have something very special in our sfos, leisure homes and clubs, but it contrasts with how little we actually research it. That is why I have called today for this debate with the Minister and the rapporteurs, in other words to discuss research into recreational education and what the Minister will do to promote recreational educational research.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421122418	Thank you for that to Mrs Lotte Rod. Then it is the Minister of Education and Research who is going on. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421122440	Thank you for your explanatory statement and thank you to the Radicals for taking the initiative on the question debate here on Danish research in recreational education. There has been a renewed political focus on leisure education in Denmark, among others. as it is demonstrated that more children and young people are miserable, as Mrs Lotte Rod also mentioned in her explanatory statement a moment ago, and perhaps also as a reaction to a long-standing focus on learning as an important purpose in teaching and, therefore, how schools and day care institutions could contribute teaching to learning as a purpose. There are, of course, some other things that apply in the area of recreational education, and in general, I think, in our society, in order to focus on other purposes as well. So perhaps also as a counter-reaction to the focus that was for many years, there has been an increased focus on leisure education. Here it is important that relevant knowledge is available that can adequately dress special educators for their important work in leisure provision. Let me start by saying that I do not have an exhaustive overview of recent Danish recreational educational research. However, it is estimated that the area of recreational education research is small. Research in recreational education constitutes a subset of the total educational research area in Denmark, and it is already a small and relatively fragmented research area. The government has therefore also embarked on capacity building in the field of pedagogical research. This is done in collaboration with the Danish Parliament's parties, where we found 200 million with funds from the research reserve from 2021. kr. over 4 years to strengthen pedagogical research. That effort is targeted at the smallest children, the 0-6-year-old area, but it is my expectation that this capacity-building will in the long term have a positive impact on the entire educational field, including recreational educational research. There are also opportunities in today's overall public research funding to prioritise funding for recreational educational research. Universities and professional colleges can, for example: choose to give priority to their research funding for the area, and the Danish Free Research Foundation and the Danish Council for Culture and Communication cover among other things. over the main area of pedagogy. In other words, funding and support can be obtained for research projects in the field of recreational education in the main area. Leisure education is very important for the good children and young people. Our children and young people must have the best leisure opportunities with the freedom to play, explore and experiment many of the qualities of the part of the educational offers in Denmark • I thought Mrs Lotte Rod was short, but well, in the explanatory statement a moment ago, and I am sure that it will be done further in the speeches about a moment • where children and young people are part of new communities, they are co-determiners, they have a free space from having to perform, and that all the good things that are in the game that are going on come to their right and, of course, also have educational support. This requires, among other things, that: skilled professional professionals who are well trained for the task of our leisure offer, and therefore we also need to focus on leisure when we discuss later this year how best to strengthen the education of educators. This is not an issue that was raised during last year's negotiations on the research reserve, and I know it has not been the case in the discussions that have taken place on it in recent years, but it is also an opportunity, if that is what the parties of the Folketing are prepared to do, that is to say, to use funds from it. I do not think that we can or should make that decision today, but it is the possibility that is Parliament's and in which we usually have good, constructive negotiations that end up with a broad agreement on priorities for research funding. However, it should be included in an overall priority at that time. The Government, under the auspices of the Ministry of Children and Education, will also establish the partnership together on leisure time, where the parties and the rapporteurs in the field can discuss challenges and solutions in relation to the development of the leisure area. As I said, it is not under my authority, but under the authority of the Minister for Children and Education, but I think it was worth mentioning, nevertheless, as an example of the fact that this discussion on recreational education is also taking place elsewhere and, of course, is an expression of the importance of the area and the increased political interest of leisure education. We can then have a discussion here about research into it and the research support for training in recreational education, and I look forward to having it. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421122936	Thank you. Then there is the possibility of one remark from the rapporteurs, if anyone wants to. There isn't. Then we start with the rapporteur's series. It's Mrs. Lotte Rod first. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421122955	Try to imagine going to school: After school day today we're going to the club, and we're not actually going home today, because we're going to sleep in shelters, so we're going to make dinner over the fire, and when we're going to bed, we're gonna roll out the sleeping pillows and lie down and look up at the stars and into the flames and talk to each other. And when we wake up in the morning, we'll have to roast bread over the fire and roll our sleeping bags again and then walk over to school. I think that's really cool, and that's the reality for some kids and kids who go to sfo and club in Køge. For me, this is one of the finest examples of some of what our leisure education can do, because we have a very special recreational educational tradition in Denmark. We have invented the junkyards, we have non-pedagogics with fire and animals, we have workshops, we have music, and we have role-playing. But we have also forgotten it a little and squeezed it. And if we don't act, I'm afraid we're gonna lose some of the most valuable. In my leisure home in Aabenraa we had rabbits, turtles, bicycle workshop, wood workshop, tall houses and underground tunnels. But the leisure homes have been closed around, and the sfos are squeezed on time, and they are also squeezed on money. As the Minister also mentioned a little, the teaching of leisure time has also been displaced by the school. I mean, time calls for recreational pedagogy, for children and young people, as never before with displeasure, with loneliness, with autism, with adhd, with depression and anxiety. And what if there's really nothing wrong with all the kids, but they're just reacting that way because of the framework that's in our society? That is why I believe in our leisure education, and one of the things we know from research is that leisure education gives children and young people the opportunity to participate in communities. In leisure and club services there are good conditions for children and young people to be able to enter into constructive social relations and communities with room for everyone, and there are activities that are based on the interests of children and young people and in what they are engaged in. Leisure teaching allows for free time with playful association and educational processes. For playful association is about the free time to play together, to try out, to explore with room for the creative, the creative and the imagination. Legendary association and the free space for not having to do something particular are essential elements of our leisure and club pedagogics, and it has a value in itself. As the Minister said, we have taken joint initiatives in this Parliament to strengthen children's research, and I would like to build on top with research into recreational education, because I believe that we need to develop recreational education, we need to learn more from it, and we need to learn from it. And, as with children's research, we must build up knowledge on education, among the educators and the other staff in our institutions. Then I also believe that we need to have some new research voices in the public debate, some voices that are always on the children's side and that can tell about the performance-free space, about the community, about the game, because we may have forgotten it a little, both as a society and as parents. We can see right now that there are many parents who report their children out because they think they are paying too dearly for something that is too bad, and perhaps because we have been too bad to talk about the importance of not just going home and being alone in the room or playing with the neighbor, which may look pretty much like a lot anyway, but that you are part of the big community at the sfo or club. I therefore believe that it is important that we strengthen research and that we cultivate the voices that may be in the public debate. That is why I am so pleased, on behalf of both the Social Democratic Party, the Left, the SF, Radicals, Enhedslisten, Conservatives and the Danish People's Party, to be able to make the following proposals for adoption: Proposals for adoption • Leisure teaching is important. Children and young people need a sanctuary where they do not have to perform, where they can play and experiment, and where educational staff can help them into the games and communities. In recreational education, children can practice mastering life and fail to meet the demands and goals of adults. Although we have a strong tradition of leisure education in Denmark, there is not much research. The Danish Parliament notes that there is an opportunity to apply for funding for research into recreational education in e.g.: Denmark's Free Research Foundation, just as universities and professional colleges can prioritise their own funds for recreational educational research. The Danish Parliament recognises that with funds from the research reserve 2021, we build up the teaching research in the field of 0-6 years. The Danish Parliament will discuss the possibilities for a further separate prioritization of public funds for research into recreational education in the negotiations on the research reserve. • V 70).
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123518	Thank you. The proposal for adoption is part of the further debate. There is a brief comment from Mrs Gitte Willumsen, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123526	Thank you. And thank you for your speech. It bears witness to a great commitment, and that is wonderful. I am probably one of the few people in this Chamber who have actually worked both in a leisure home and in a sfo many, many years ago, and these are fantastic places. Then I just want to hear from the rapporteur about the long school day's influence on these leisure homes and sfos. Does the rapporteur agree that it has squeezed the opportunity to unfold the game and the creative space for children that we have this long school day? We Conservatives are not very enthusiastic about that, but what does the rapporteur think about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123612	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123613	Thank you for that question. I totally agree. In the Radical Left we would like to have shorter school days, both because we believe that the resources are best spent in school, if you can be two teachers or a teacher and a teacher on or divide into smaller teams instead of lubricating it beyond a longer day, but also because it has a value in itself to have time to be in leisure education. I think it is a big mistake that there has simply been too little time, because it takes some time both to come up with a game, to negotiate games with each other and to be immersed in it, but also to be able to have different projects. If you're playing a role-playing game, it takes a while to make it. I therefore believe that we have an important task here on the part of the Danish Parliament when we talk about the short day of school, to say that it is both about the school, but indeed also about the value of leisure education, play and free time for children in themselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123702	Here you go, Mrs. Gitte Willumsen. No, not anyway. There will then be no further comments to the rapporteur, so we will proceed in the rapporteur's line. Mrs. Ida Auken, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123716	I would like to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is very important. I also think that the link that Radicale's rapporteur makes to children and young people's mental well-being and ill-being is right. There are, at least, too many children and young people who have both anxiety and depression and are diagnosed with diagnoses that may also be linked to an overactive nervous system that does not get the calm that we know the game gives. So I think it is important, and it is also important for us, as adults, to look at generations that have worse well-being and worse mental health. I almost think the worst thing is that we do not know what is the cause of that trend. And that is why we must do what we can to give our children the very best start to life. The pedagogy that children meet in the institutions and in schools must be of the highest quality and based on knowledge, including on these themes. Fortunately, Denmark has a strong field of research in the educational field, and in the agreement on the research reserve in 2021 we set aside money to build capacity in relation to pedagogical research. The action is targeted at 0-6 years, but it is expected to have a positive impact on educational research in general. In addition, funds can be sought for research into recreational pedagogy in the Danish Free Research Foundation, and at both universities and professional colleges, own funds can be used for research on the subject. Finally, in annual negotiations on the research reserve, priority can be given to research into recreational education. Finally, I think it is worth mentioning that the Ministry of Children and Education will establish the partnership together on the Leisure Period, where parties and rapporteurs in the field can discuss the development of the leisure area, and here also knowledge about leisure education can be included in the discussions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123915	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Lotte Rod. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123918	Thanks for the speech and for showing some of the options there are. That is why I would like to ask: what will the Social Democrats do to promote research into recreational education?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123929	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421123930	We've got one of them. set aside money for research in pedagogy at all in this research reserve we made for 2021. Even if we do so in relation to the future, I will not stand here and promise; that seems to me to be an advance. Nor did I hear radical laws that they are giving money to this in connection with the forthcoming debate on the research reserve. But we do have the theme here today, we have the debate today. I also think it will be quite important to look at what the partnership together on Leisure, which is being made, comes with proposals. So maybe we're just a post office too early right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124007	Then there are no more comments. Let's move on. It's Mrs. Ulla Tørnæs, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124022	Thank you very much. We are all concerned with creating the very best framework and conditions for our children and young people. We are also concerned with doing everything we can to counter the growing and growing distrust among too many children and young people. In this light, I would like, among other things, to thank you. to see the question debate here. So thank you to Mrs Lotte Rod for asking someone like me to relate to research into recreational education. I freely admit that this is not my primary competence. Although research into leisure education and the area of leisure education in itself is in fact fast, one can see that it risks being overlooked in the large pool of all the good things we would like to do for children and young people, it does not make the area less important, according to my opening remarks here. At school, we know you can learn about fractions. You learn to read Steen Steensen Blicher if you're lucky. But much of the learning about life, personal responsibility and respect for other children and adults is also happening outside school. It happens, as Mrs Lotte Rod mentioned, in the sfo, it happens in the leisure club and through other social activities after school. Children and young people, as we all know, need a sanctuary where they do not have to perform and where they can experiment through play with each other. That is why, in my view, we need at first to become even more aware of what is working in recreational education today. I am of the opinion that, as a rule, more knowledge always makes a basis for decision all the better. The knowledge created in the educational field will always be in eternal movement and development, and fortunately for it. But if leisure education starts to be decoupled from that development, then it goes without saying that we will then have a school system that runs in one track and a leisure educational area that runs in another track. I think this is actually inappropriate and it therefore calls for more knowledge, i.e. research into recreational education. Enough about it, and I shall not be wiser in recreational education, because, as I said, it is certainly not my primary competence. However, the question here is probably so much about how we prioritise our scarce research resources, and in the proposal for adoption to which we in the Left are co-sponsors, we point out that there is one area in which we, as parliamentary politicians, have an influence in terms of what we spend our research resources on. This is the research reserve that we contribute to once a year and where we can set the direction for what we want more knowledge and what we want researchers to research in. I would like to take this opportunity to say that although it is now a question of research into recreational education, it will also be the main priority of the Left in the forthcoming negotiations on the implementation of the research reserve, that we give priority to funding for the green transition, that is to say, research into the green transition, research into new technologies, research into life science. The agendas that have been important for the Left in recent years will also be important for the Left in the future. However, this does not change the fact that, as a follow-up to the research reserve agreement of 2021, we are very open to seeing whether there is a need for us to give priority to resources in the research reserve, so that specific research is carried out in this area, which we are all concerned about doing better. It is precisely as I said that it is countering the growing distrust among too many young people. This will hopefully help to ensure that all young people have a good environment and conditions for their childhood and their upbringing. We are co-sponsors of the proposal for adoption and can, of course, support it. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124507	Thank you. Mrs Lotte Rod has just made a point. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124509	Thank you so much for your speech. It is simply a pleasure in itself to hear the rapporteur of the Left talking about leisure education and the games and the performance-free spaces, and everyone in here just needs to know that what we say from the platform really means a lot to the professional pride that is out there, so the fact that we in the Folketing take it seriously is actually the first important step in itself. So thank you so much. And thank you very much also for joining in our joint proposal for the adoption that we should look at the possibilities of prioritising recreational education in the research reserve, which is why I have a question to the Left about it. Can the Left imagine that we are really building on the model we have developed for children's research, where we are building up the whole skeleton, but that it is only for the 0-6-year-old area, and say that with these experiences we have from it, we could then build on top and make an effort in recreational educational research?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124604	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124605	That is what I tried to say in all modesty. In any case, I personally need to know more about what the resources we allocated in 2021 have actually led to and where we are. It is important for me to stress that the priorities that we usually bring to the table when we jointly implement the research reserve will also be the future priorities of the Left. However, that does not change the fact that it is highly likely, if there is political will to do so, that funds can also be given to this area, if needed, in view of the fact that we, or at least I, lack knowledge about the coinage of the part of the research reserve that was used in 2021 for the children's area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124700	Thank you. There are no more brief comments, so we go further. Mrs Astrid Carøe, Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421124708	Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the authors of the questions. Leisure education is an extremely important area and I think it is very clear that there is too little research in this area, so it is very good that we have this talk today. Leisure education should not just be something where the children can go after school because their parents come home late from work. Children need a sanctuary where they do not have to perform, where they can play and experiment, and where there are educational staff to help children into the game and open up new paths in the game. In recreational education, children should be able to practice mastering life, and here they should not live up to adults' demands for goals, but play and learn freely. There is no doubt that we need knowledge about what good educational work in both the school and leisure sectors means to the children, and in particular the research area of leisure education is small in Denmark. We must, of course, ensure that the leisure establishments around the country have a high level of professionalism and the quality of education needed to ensure that children are also provided after school with a good and developing framework. There have been huge savings on the sfo both in the primary school reform and since then in the municipalities, and most recently with corona, which has made many people report their children out of the sfo, and we really need to take this seriously. But it helps not only to look at the sfo as a whole right now, we also need to look at the long-term visions and invest in research, so we have good offers of sfo and freedom both this year and next year and in the coming years. But I would also just like to say that when we look at the public sector in general and when it comes to trade and young people, there is a huge lack of research. We have made up our minds by setting aside funds last year for educational research in the area of children from 0 to 6 years, but we are not in the end at all. In connection with the distribution of last year's research reserve, we also had a talk about vocational training. There are very few researchers in this area, some are also up in age and may soon retire, and we lack knowledge in the field of vocational training about what makes young people choose vocational training and what makes them stay. There is much more research in high schools, for example, probably because that is where the researchers themselves come from. It is just to say that there are very many places in the public institutions in which young people and children experience and live, in which there is not much research, and we in the SF think we should do something about that. We also had a debate last year in the research reserve on research into socially vulnerable children and young people, which is also hugely lacking. We also see this in social worker training. So, we lack research throughout the education system in how children and young people interact and how children and young people generally feel. I think it was a step along the way that we strengthened the educational research area last year and that we set aside these 50 million. kr. Every year until 2024 but, as you know, it is aimed at the smallest children. We in the SF are very happy about this, but it doesn't really cover this area, which is recreational education, that is, what happens after school for children over 6 years of age. I think the Minister is right in saying that it can build capacity in general, but the money is not intended for recreational education. It requires necessary research to ensure that children want to be part of the strong community that is in the sfo because they do not want to go home because they think it is great to be in the sfo and because they experience the things that I think the rapporteur for the Radical Left's very fine rapporteur speech came around. We need to know more about everything that is not on a schedule, but that creates the joy of life and development for children and young people throughout our educational system. So I very much agree with the intention of the authors of the question that it is important for research to be carried out in recreational education, we support the text of the adoption, and we also take this into account in relation to the research reserve, but we do not think that we should start this debate now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125146	Thank you. There is a brief comment. Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125148	Thank you very much also to the SF for a very fine speech. I would like to ask the same question that I also asked the Left, namely whether SF could see that we are really building on what we are doing with children's research and putting it on top of so that we use the good experiences and the system we are building up, but are doing something separate for recreational education in addition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125209	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125209-2	I could easily see that. In general, I think we should be careful not to give too many advice. Now we also have a PhD council in the school field, for example, and we've got this research council for the children's area, or whatever it's going to be called specifically. So I think it is important when things fit together and go so far as to ensure that they speak together and that the capacities we are building up with it are used, I think, quite a large amount of funding that we have, after all, been given here. I also think it is important for us to have a look at this PhD council in the school field, which I think is good, and it is good that we had it set up, and I think we could build on that. But that is what the research council in the field of children we have just adopted or the intentions behind the PhD council are actually building on. Yeah, I think it's a good idea to think it together.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125257	Thank you. There are no more comments. Let's move on. It's sir. Bruno Jerup, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125307	Thank you for that, and thank you to the authors for having raised this discussion. It is quite true, as several people have said, that one of the problems with leisure education is that it has been a little in the shadow of this and it has been in the shadow of the discussion we have had about the development of primary school, where it is the case that it runs according to teaching plans and some very clear objectives. It has, as it were, been a bit like something else that we may not have dealt with properly. That is why there is clearly a need for increased research in this area, but there is also a need for us as a society to have a greater focus on the importance of recreational education • the time when our children and young people are trying to be challenged and develop outside the ordinary, we should say compulsory school hours. As I have said, this possibility has been a little underturned for a number of years and, as others have said, it has been a consequence of the fact that we have made a primary school where it is the case that the school day has been very, very long. That is why it has happened that many parents may have done so, that they have simply dropped the sfo, because there was still too little time, that is to say too little, and it is a major problem that we must somehow have turned. But the first knowledge we need is, of course, knowledge of what kind of recreational education is that is actually good and beneficial for our children and our young people. Then there are also some who have mentioned that one of the major problems is the misfortune of young people. Of course, one of the things that can help create this distrust is that we have a leisure arrangement for our children and young people who are too poor. There are, of course, other factors too. That is how it is when you talk about such social factors that may affect the distrust of our young people. But it is a major problem, as it has also emerged in many contexts, that there is that distrust, and we also need to have an eye on that. It is, of course, true, as some have also said, that what lies in having a free time is that it is a free space, but it does not mean, as some have said, that it is such a place where you do not have expectations and the pressure of expectation is gone. That may not be quite right, because what actually happens when children play together is that they also set expectations for each other. In this way, it may well be that it was some other expectations that you get into when you play. It doesn't matter whether you do it in a sfo, or you do it at home on the street, if you play with the neighbor, because of course you build up expectations, and you also have some kind of role-playing in it. Every time you enter into a partnership or a game, and this is also true here in the Folketing, you are part of a role, and the role has also been built into you, that you have some expectations of others, you have some expectations of yourself, so you like to try to make it work. It's just to tell you what we're talking about here. At any rate, I think it is important that we get a greater focus on the importance of leisure time, the play or role development that our young people have and which others have been and which they have come in the absence of here for a number of years. So it is just to say that it is good that a debate is being held. If nothing else, it can help create for a greater focus on the importance of this. We also support the proposal for adoption which has been read out here earlier, and we also agree that it would be a good idea if we were to look at whether we could find some funds for that research, for example. from the research reserve. We know that when we come to the table on the research reserve, there are also many other requests which, of course, have to be negotiated. But just the fact that we have this debate and we have this proposal for adoption which is here, is of course helping to push a little bit on this car, at least in relation to it. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125826	There is just one point from Mrs Lotte Rod. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125828	Thank you for your speech and for talking about the importance of play, role development and communities.Thanks also for being in on the proposal for adoption, where we just write that we need to look at the opportunities to support leisure education through the research reserve. Therefore, just a question for Enhedslisten: What does Enhedslisten think about it if you build on the model that we have now created for children's research, and put recreational education into it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125858	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125859	I would like to say straight away that I could be in favour of this being a possible model. I do not want to be here from the platform, as if it were the only model one could imagine. But it could be a way to say that the framework for the 0-6-year-olds has to be moved, so we get the kids with us all the way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125925	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Conservative People's Party, and that is Mrs Gitte Willumsen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421125940	Today we have a request for a stronger focus on recreational education, which is prompted by Mrs Lotte Rod of the Radical Left. The Conservative People's Party is a party with a focus on the family and the next generation. That is why I am very pleased with this debate here today. This is a good and important debate. Leisure education is important, and we have strong traditions in this area, and we have very talented educators to help children into the game, in the creative spaces and in the different communities. As with everything else, it is important that we start from research and, unfortunately, there is not much research in this area. That is why we support an increased focus on research into recreational education and look forward to real discussions in the context of the negotiations on the research reserve. I have received this speech from Britt Baker, but I would be happy to accept it if anyone has anything to ask. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130045	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a brief comment to be made to the rapporteur from Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130050	Thank you very much for your speech from me, too. So, in some way, these debates in the Folketing are not really so knitted together that we are making a joint text for adoption, where we agree with each other, because then it becomes a little strange to ask questions, because in fact we have already agreed with each other in the text of the adoption, which we could otherwise ask about here, namely that we would like to look at it in the research reserve. Therefore, I would just like to ask the same question to the Conservatives that I have put to the others: could it make sense for the Conservatives to take what we are now doing in the field of child research and then expand it with leisure education?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130126	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130127	In any case, we would very much like to enter into a discussion on this. Well, we think this leisure area is really important, and we are also aware of what it means to children's self-conception that you have a good leisure life. And it matters how it is framed by educators. I personally believe that it is very important that educators also have some expectations of the children, in terms of how you are together, how you are involved in relationships in leisure time, as is the case during school hours. And that is why it is also important to have some research in this area that can tell the educators out in the leisure arrangements if there is something to be addressed in relation to relationships with children that can strengthen their self-esteem and thus their social life and their health.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130219	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Danish People's Party, and that is Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130232	Thank you, President. In the best of all worlds, Dad goes home, no, he goes to work, and Mom goes home, and then when the kids come home from school, they throw away the school bag and go out and play with each other. This is not the case for most people today, which is why many people send their children in a sfo or in a leisure home, and so it is also important that we know that those who have a recreational educational responsibility are also prepared for it, and therefore it makes sense to look at it in research terms. We know that there are major challenges with the well-being of children today, among others. The digitalisation, social media have a huge impact on our children. We do not know what the context is, nor do we know what the measures would be effective. We know that research points to major negative consequences of digitalisation and also of less exercise, but we do not know how to handle it, and that is why we in the Danish People's Party also recognise the need for further research, to gain more knowledge about contexts and possible interventions, and that is also one of the reasons why we are in the text of the adoption. These should be the words of the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130349	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are a few brief comments to be made to the rapporteur, firstly to Mrs Ida Auken, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130353	Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen, that I shouldn't be sitting here, but should be at home with my kids?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130358	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130407	It must be each family that decides it. That's personal responsibility. I grew up with my mom at home, and Dad went to work and look, really magnificent copy that's come out of it. But how Mrs. Ida Auken and her husband arrange their everyday life must be entirely up to them and each family.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130425	Mrs. Ida Auken.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130426	The rapporteur just said that in the best of all worlds, Mother goes home and I am the mother of two children, so I have to understand that Mr. Alex Ahrendtsen believes that it is best that I go home and am not here in the Folketing and represent more than 20,000 Danes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130440	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130441	In the ideal world, but I do not have to rule Mrs Ida Auken's world. Mrs Ida Auken has her personal freedom to choose exactly how she will organize her family and her everyday life. I don't want to be a judge of anything but my own little world. I know what I would prefer myself, and I also know that I grew up with it and that it has been good for me. I'm sure there's a lot of other models that are good for having kids. I don't have to decide in my little reactionary world, yes, that's where I prefer daddy to go to work, and that mom to take care of the kids. And then they go out and play in the woods when they get off school.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130521	The next brief remark is to Mrs Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130523	We simply have such a smoking disagreement about that. I think it is a huge step forward that women can be allowed to go to work. But I really think it is very beautiful that, although we can disagree on it so much, we can still meet to see that the children who are in institutions have the best conditions there, and that is why it is important that we strengthen research. And therefore I just want to ask Dansk Folkeparti: Could Dansk Folkeparti see for itself that we the research reserve expand the effort they make for the 0-6-year-olds to lay....oveni?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130556	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130557	After all, 50 million have been set aside. kr. Annually in 2021-24 to support capacity building in research. So it would be obvious to find some money for that, so we're getting smarter. It is important, of course, that when we transfer responsibility for children to recreational educators, they are also trained to do so. For recreational education and leisure homes is a substitute for a home. That is why we must ensure that the people who receive our children are also equipped to do so. And the more we know, the better we can organise an education, and the better they are educated, the better they can also accept our children.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130639	Thank you, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen, Dansk Folkeparti. There are no more brief remarks to the rapporteur and, as far as I can see, all the rapporteurs who wanted to speak have been on. And so I can give the floor to the Minister for Education and Research. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130700	Thank you for an excellent debate. It came out a little bit on other and a little surprising roads towards the end. But many times from the end but I think it has been an excellent debate which very much highlights the relevance of leisure education. And I can also hear from that discussion... I am glad that we can gather together in this very broad support for a text on top of the discussion, and that we have a common basis for the further discussion... that we will return to the discussions over the coming months and when we will discuss the distribution of the research reserve later this year in relation to the Finance Act. There is what Mrs Ulla Tørnæs mentioned, major and important areas that we have prioritised: green research, technology, health. And leisure education has not been an issue raised in the past by the parties, but I can of course draw the conclusion today that, although it has not been decided whether and how, and possibly how much, it is a subject we will be discussing there, and I shall look forward to that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130811	Thank you, Minister. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to the Minister, and that is to Mrs Lotte Rod, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130816	Thank you. I am very much looking forward to that too, and so my question to the Minister should just be: what are we doing wisely as the next step? How can we prepare for what would be wise to do? What does the Minister think would be a good process?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130832	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130833	So, I guess I'm thinking that anyone who has been there today and listened to the discussion can hear that the emphasis is being placed on leisure education and the quality that must be there and on the many important things about that part of child and youth life. However, there is also a conclusion that today this is not a subject on which we are researching very much, so we have to realise our priorities before we have to start the big task of distributing research funds later this year. That may be the follow-up question, but I would like to start with it. In other words, there will be a good structure for using research in the field of 0-6 years, as we agreed on it. That is what Mrs Lotte Rod has said a few times in the debate here. After all, we can continue the discussion that is being set up there. I just want to make sure that it's not the case that whatever you have to build on top of it, if you end up doing it, then don't go beyond the purpose we've already decided. I just think it's important to say that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130938	Mrs. Lotte Rod.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130939	Thank you for clarifying that. In other words, we have just created a research area, the 0-6-year-olds, which is a separate area and has so much needed to be lifted. So just a word of thanks to the Minister for saying very clearly that leisure education must, of course, come on top and not be taken out of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130957	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421130958	Well, I actually think I can add a lot more, but compared to that building upstairs: if you imagine making such a larger, but total, appropriation for all of this, the risk will be that you get some of the purpose that we have decided on in the 0-6-year period. And I would like to make it clear straight away that I do not think this would be in line with the decision taken by the parties, nor with my interest. But I did not hear that as Mrs Lotte Rod's position, so I guess we will end up with a joint text for adoption and a common understanding of what kind of discussion we can have with each other over the coming months.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131031	Thank you to the Minister, there are no further brief comments to the Minister. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. The vote on the proposed adoption will take place on Tuesday 26 April 2022, as I said earlier.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131049	The debate is open and the first rapporteur comes from the Social Democratic Party. It's sir. Troels Ravn.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131117	Thank you for the floor. When the Social Democracy went to elections on 5 June 2019, we promised Danes who have worked hard through long and hard working lives a worthy withdrawal. Some people called that the biggest bluff in Danish politics, but we kept what we promised. For, of course, when we ask the Danes to work longer, we are also obliged to take into account the fact that some people's working lives are more fluid than others and that some start earlier in the labour market than others. And that is why we adopted the right to early retirement, the so-called Arne pension, with Dansk Folkeparti, SF and Enhedslisten. And today is another reminder of just that: we keep our promises and we want dignity for those who, week after week, year after year and decade after decade have cared for their jobs and paid their taxes. For today, we have to deal first with the legislative proposal designed to guarantee the financing of the right to a previous pension. The first financing element to be added relates to a social contribution from the financial sector. In concrete terms, there will be an increase in corporation tax for financial companies, so that the income of companies will be taxed at 25.2%. in 2023 and 26%. From 2024. In this way, the financial sector will contribute more to the Community. The second financing element proposed is a ceiling on the deduction of the highest wages and salaries. The ceiling is a basic amount corresponding to approx. 7,5 million kr. in 2022. The Danish welfare society has created one of the richest and most equal countries in the world. The trust and community we have in Denmark across income and generations is unique. We must safeguard that, and we must strengthen it, and we do so with the right to early retirement, and this is made possible by this proposal. The draft law is basically about respect for those people who have entered the labour market early, have been paying their taxes for many years and helping to create the society that we all enjoy. Of course, the Social Democratic Party supports the proposal, and so does Mr. Rune Lund and Enhedslisten, I should say hello.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131337	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur and it is noted that the Enhedslisten welcomes you. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur, and that is from Mrs Louise Schack Elholm, the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131346	I am sorry to enter the Chamber, which went a little faster than I expected. But thank you for the rapporteur's intervention. Now I have read a little about the various cases, and one can say that the economic wise men dump this tax and say that it makes Denmark poorer because such a special tax damages Denmark. If you do, is it a sign that the Socialists are more concerned about imposing extra taxes on Danes than about trying to conduct a responsible economic policy?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131419	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131420	I think it is really, very important, as I also said in my rapporteur's speech, and it is good that the rapporteur managed to get in just the last sentence of my speech, that we now have the right to a previous pension for those who work the most hardest and hardest in the labour market, and that we now also have that agreement funded. And I believe that the agreement is fair and fair. The financial sector must contribute more to the Community, and it is a sector which has had billions of profits in recent years, and an additional social contribution is therefore absolutely appropriate, so that those who have worn and dragged into a long working life now have the right to a dignified withdrawal. So I think it is a bill that is positive and in good balance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131509	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131510	I do not really think that was an answer to why it is that you want to introduce a tax that is so damaging to the Danish economy, but put it aside; that is enough because there is not a good answer to it. However, I was still curious because the rapporteur says that there is a great deal of profit in this industry. As I am informed, there is not as much profit as there are in many other industries. So can the rapporteur just state why the rapporteur thinks there is a greater profit here than there should be?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131538	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131538-2	I have not advocated that there is a greater profit than there should be. I am talking about a fair and fair social contribution to a very good piece of legislation that is now in place. And I noticed that the banks at least in 2019 had a surplus of 25 billion. kr. So I think that this social contribution that we are now taking from the financial sector is fair and fair.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131604	The next brief remark is to Mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131607	Yes, well, there is a tax on the profits that companies have, also on the profits of banks. There is general corporation tax in Denmark. The pharmaceutical companies have made greater profits than the banks have. All possible companies and the wind turbine industry may even have made greater profits than many banks have. So why is it that the banks should have an extra tax, and why should it really be called a social contribution rather than just called a tax? It is quite normal to the left of the middle, both for the Social Democratic Party and further to the extreme left, that people who make a lot of money, like people who say that they are egoists and some who are cheating society, are cheating. But now I understand that in this expression social contributions are that those who pay a lot of taxes because they make a lot of money contribute more to society than those who don't pay so much in taxes because they don't make that much money.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131707	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131708	I don't want to suspect anyone. I cannot understand the vocabulary of the rapporteur for the Liberal Alliance in relation to my rapporteur's speech, but behind this lies, as I have said several times, that I think it is fair and proper that the financial world is making this contribution to society. The state gave the banks a hand in the financial crisis, one can point out, and then one can say that it is also fair that the banks are now providing their social contributions so that Arne and the others who have been working hard jobs and paid to the welfare society for many years can be entitled to an early retirement pension.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131751	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131752	Well, what kind of strange thing is it to say they don't make their social contribution already? They pay taxes, as do other companies, and if it is about how much profit they have made, then pharmaceutical companies in Denmark have more profits than what banks have, but it may not be suitable to be demonised by social democratic politicians. They make medicines that make people healthy, whereas those who have to do with money and borrow money and take interest and something that the Social Democrats think is a little suspect should pay something more, and instead of calling it extra tax, they call it a social contribution, as if they are not already contributing. What is this nonsense?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131830	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131831	Well, I'm not demonizing anyone. This is not something that is suspect, and I certainly also admit that the financial world is helping to support society in general; there is no doubt about that at all. The situation is that we are financing the right to early retirement here with this bill. I think it is right and proper that the financial world should now also step in with what we call a social contribution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131902	The next brief remark is to Mr. Torsten Schack Pedersen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421131906	Thank you. First of all, I would like to make a comment to the rapporteur, who said that the state has now helped the banks in the financial crisis. I would just like to ask whether the rapporteur can confirm that we, of course, took a good deal of money for that in the Folketing when these bank packages were made available and that it was actually a billion surplus business for the state just to sing that myth in the ground. Because I am quite sure that the rapporteur can confirm that the interest paid by Danish financial institutions was very high. And I think that was quite fair because they needed the capital, and then they had to pay the price. I even know that some of them would have liked to have been out of the loans when the markets were back, and the then left-wing government maintained that those loans would of course have to be repaid over the time and with the interest income that the state had expected, and that could not be bought out. That was one thing. The second point is that the bill here does not even live up to what the Social Democratic Party went to the polls on, because it was only the banks that had to pay. Can the rapporteur confirm that more companies have to pay than banks alone?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132014	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132015	What is the matter here is that the state gave the banks a hand in the financial crisis. And I think these calculations can be done in different ways. For example: in relation to the banking package I, the interest costs of the 30-year government bonds in the calculation have not been calculated. There was a gross interest expense, which amounts to a very large amount of billions, which taxpayers have actually helped to pay. So I think these calculations can be done in different ways. But the fact that this financial sector is good for society and is socially supportive, there is no doubt whatsoever. But here we find a fair and fair way to get the bill well funded, and this social contribution I find quite right.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132106	Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132107	Yes, you have to be concerned about what the next industry, which the government and the Social Democrats praise, is, because then you have to understand that it is a gain to be allowed to pay a so-called social contribution, which is, after all, just a social democratic wordwriter of rising taxes. I should like to hear from the rapporteur whether he can say whether he agrees with the economic wise men and others when they stress in their analyses that it is not bank managers or bank shareholders who are going to pay this tax increase, but that it is the customers, that is, that this extra tax bill is going to hit ordinary Danish bank customers and ordinary Danish companies, who are going to get increasing interest and fees as a result of this tax.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132150	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132151	After all, it could be hoped that it would be borne by the owners of the financial sector. We could hope that this would happen decently and that it would not be passed on to increasing fees. At least that is a position that I have. I think it should first of all be borne in mind that, when the banks were in great difficulty during the financial crisis, Denmark and the taxpayers went in and helped them through the crisis. And now we are asking the banks and the financial sector to make a modest contribution to enabling people who have worked hard to retire a little earlier.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132227	The next brief remark is to Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132230	I think it was someone associated with the government who said: I hope it's not this strategy. Now the rapporteur hopes that the banks will not pass the bill on to the citizens, but historically that is what happens when an increased burden is imposed on business, because then part of the bill will be passed on to customers. It should be the first time in the history of Denmark that it will not happen if it does not happen now. And then the rapporteur says that we believe that this time the owners will take it. But who are the owners of the banks? Yes, it is shareholders, and it may be pension funds and others in which normal people have their pension savings, and they must then watch it get hit by this. Is it really reasonable at a time when people find it difficult to pay the bills out there, when they see their electricity bills rising, their heating bills rising, food prices rising, that they should now also see that with decisions on the part of the Folketing their bank costs are likely to increase? Is that the answer that should be given to the Danes in the situation that many of them are in right now?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132340	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132342	Let me just correct the rapporteur for the New Citizens' Party, because I am not talking about the fact that I think enough. I said that I can hope that it will be decently the case that it will be the owners who will bear the burden and that it will not be passed on to the customers. I hope so. Then I am glad that the rapporteur for the New Citizens' Party has such concern for ordinary people. Then New Citizens should also be happy to vote in favour of this proposal, because this is about ordinary people, whom we now ensure a dignified withdrawal after a long life of hard work on the labour market. That's what this is all about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132419	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132420	No, that's not correct. This is a proposal to put increased expenditure on the banking sector, which will then be passed on to customers. We will then be able to deal with another legislative proposal on the other, but this is about increased costs and charges, and I would ask the rapporteur to take a look at the proposal that is actually being dealt with in the Chamber. Is it true that here one can hope that it is the owners who take the cost, but that it might as well smoke over to the bankers? I would just like to ask whether, in the rapporteur's view, it is okay that it is now becoming more expensive for customers to have a bank account.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132447	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132447-2	As I have said several times, I hope that it will be decent that it will be the owners who bear the burden of this, because that should be the case. When the banks were in trouble, it was ordinary taxpayers who, together with society, i.e. the community, helped to keep their hands under the banks. This is about funding a bill, a bill on retirement, a previous pension, the right to a previous pension for those who have worked long ago and in the hardest jobs in the labour market.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132524	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Left, and that is Mrs Louise Schack Elholm. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421132534	Thank you for the floor. With this bill, the government now comes with two tax increases in the pile of the huge number of tax increases that have gradually been implemented. The two tax increases are, on the one hand, a particularly high rate of corporation tax for the financial sector and, on the other hand, the removal of part of the corporate income tax deduction for labour costs. Let us take the first first one: a specially increased corporate tax rate for the financial sector. It is not for the whole financial sector, no, because occupational pensions are excluded, so it has been ensured that some pensions are excluded. However, the Danes who have a pension in a private pension company such as: Danica, SEB or the like, is also gonna help pay this tax. In fact, Finance Denmark expects this to cost an ordinary family with a house about DKK 1,400. extra a year. It's money anyway. So, when you think of all the other tax increases that this government has introduced, it will soon start to hurt the Danes. At the moment, prices are rising sharply and prices are rising sharply and these, as far as I remember, are well above 40 tax increases for more than DKr 40 million. kr.; it is also money, but not quite as many people will hurt the Danes' economy, and at some point the Danes will really feel how expensive it is to have a red government. I hope they find out before the next parliamentary elections so they don't get hit later. But again, it hits awkwardly. Those who have their pension savings through a trade union movement are free, but those who have a career-like position have to pay. Those who have a mortgage have to pay, while those who do not have a mortgage do not have to finance it that way. But as long as you have a bank account, you're gonna help pay for this tax increase, and after all, it probably has almost every Dane. So it is a tax that will hit all Danes, but it is clear that the government has once again made sure that it is those who have a private pension fund or own their own house that are hit hardest. Besides making the Danes poorer here and now, this extra tax also makes Denmark poorer in the long run. The economic wise men have been out to say that this is not a tax that will make it more effective; it will hamper the growth of Danish society. So not only does it make the Danes poorer with about 1,400 DKK. a year here and now, no, in the long term, it makes the whole of society poorer, because it is an inefficient tax when you make a special tax. So this is bad because it makes us poorer here and now and because it makes us poorer in the long run. In addition, it is deeply opaque. After all, there are many people who are talking about wanting to have a single tax system, but here you choose, so to speak, that parts of the financial sector in 2023 should multiply their corporate tax rate by a fraction called 25.2/22, and that is the rate they have to pay. Then it changes in 2024 to 26/22. It's just so long-haired. How many people can figure out what they're gonna have to pay? So this government is also making it harder to figure out what to pay for taxes and make the tax system more complicated. Then there is the fact that the principle of companies being able to deduct all labour costs from their tax payments is now being abolished. It helps to make the marginal tax considerably higher for the highest wage income, and it is a way of saying that you will not have the best directors in Denmark • they have to look elsewhere, because it has to be more expensive to hire good people in Denmark. It is also one thing that will hinder growth for Denmark, because if we do not get some good directors, then we will probably not get the same growth in companies either, because the best directors are usually those who are paid the best. So all in all, it is two tax increases from this government that are being added to the pile of tax increases. It makes Denmark and the Danes poorer here and now, and therefore I really hope that the Danes will discover it before the next elections, so that they can have a government elected that will take care of the Danes and the Danes' economy. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133002	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Socialist People's Party, and that is Mr. Carl Valentin. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133012	Thank you very much. It is not often that I just get the credit of talking about early retirement, but that is also the case when there are agreements that will then have to be financed through a tax proposal. In fact, I think this is quite an important matter, because the right to early retirement is about justice and it is about fairness. I think it is about people who cannot work until they are close to 70 years of age being met with the respect they deserve. That's one of the things we're looking for here. Fighting that fight for some of the people who take a very hard tow in their lives is very important for a socialist party like ours. It has also been important to us in this process that the right to early retirement should also be financed in a spirit of solidarity, and I think that the proposal we are discussing here has been very successful. That is why, of course, we also support the funding provided for in the agreement that we are discussing today. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133119	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a wish for a few brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. It is only from Mrs Louise Schack Elholm, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133123	I would like to ask you about the fact that the SF is talking about something that is wrong and whether it is about beneficiaries of transfer income. Is it reasonable that it is always quite ordinary Danes who buy a house and want to pay off their loans to the house, who may have a car and may also have a pension fund to be hit financially by the tax increases that you bring? In other words, how many tax increases does the rapporteur think such an ordinary Danish family that is not a high-paid family can stand?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133159	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133200	I think it would be strange to say something about how many tax increases a family can bear, because it also depends on the benefits they get from potentially making those tax increases. However, there is no doubt that the policy of the SF in the field of taxation is generally about creating more equality. That is why we want the focus, if we are to increase taxation, to be at the top of society. In fact, that is something that is being done in concrete terms with this proposal. When we talk about very high wages, we are talking about salaries of more than 7.5 million. kr. to directors of large companies, and when it comes to the financial sector, it is about some of the richest people in our society. Ordinary people, ordinary families, can cope with a tax increase if they also get something positive out of it. It may be that in this family there is a person who is working extremely hard and who has entered the labour market very early, who is now entitled to an early retirement pension. I think this is extremely important and it would also be beneficial to that family, so I can fully support the policy we have here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133258	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133259	So this tax increase of 1,400 kroner. for an ordinary Danish family, i.e. not a high-paid family, but an ordinary Danish family with a house, is quite fine also when you look at the rising energy prices and the rising prices in general, and when you look at that it is also they who have to pay the whole bill for the replacement of their natural gas pine. It is on all parameters that you are quite okay with it being able to hit them because they belong to the high-paid because they own their own house. Or where is the limit of being highly paid?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133330	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133331	It is a technical question to ask where the limit is to be high paid. It could be that, if you are to have a definition of it, you have to say that if you pay top tax, that person is highly paid. But what we are adopting here is acting, among other things. to ensure that some of the people who are paid the most in Danish companies earning more than 7.5 million. kr. a year, contributes something more, and that there will be an extra corporation tax on financial companies, which I then call a social contribution, and that, in my view, is fine.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133406	The next brief remark is to Mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133409	I would like to ask you about this: is it suspicious that directors get much higher salaries than the private employee on the floor? So they should not be allowed to have that, at least not, by deducting the expense from the company's accounts, as can be done with all other salaries. That's something weird. I mean, the director is just an employee who is employed by some capitalists. And when they give him or her 15 million. kr. A year, if that is the salary, it is because they expect the Director to contribute more than 15 million. kr. to the company's turnover. If they thought the director could only make 10 million. kr. to the company, they wouldn't pay a salary of 15 million. kr. Why should we actually do that by suspecting that there are some employees who can earn such high wages, while others earn more normal wages?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133507	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133508	I don't think it's about suspicious anyone. I think it is about some basic social analysis and analysis of how value is created. And to me, value is created when you go out to work and produce something. And we have set up a society today where there are a few rich people who also have the opportunity to get part of the value that others go out and create. For this reason, we must also decide how much of the value that others create is to be achieved as a director, for example. In other words, what part of the added value should one be able to acquire? I think it is perfectly legitimate that we have a progressive tax system which ensures that we tax some of the richest, and I also think we could tax some of the richest higher than we do today. It is not about suspicion; it is about justice and equality. And I believe that an equal society is not only a fairer society but also a better society. And that is why we also have a progressive tax policy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133608	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133609	Well, the director produces, too. The director produces it to hire some talented people in the company. The director produces a vision of where the company is going. The director produces it to have the big overview. The director produces all sorts of things. And there is a reason why a company will give a director 10 or 15 million. kr. a year. And that's because the company's owners think the manager is worth more than 10 or 15 million. kr. So you might as well problematize that a superligas player gets more in pay than a half-time professional in the first division, but it's foolish to do so. Similarly, what the SF and the government are doing here is also foolish.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133646	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133647	In fact, I think it is a little harsh to compare it with footballers in that way, as if, if you are high-paid, you are necessarily better than if you are low-paid. Well, it's basically just that we reward different work differently. And I don't think it's more fine, for example. To be a doctor than to be a garbageman or a soil and concrete worker, whatver. I just think there's a difference between how we pay people. And then this is all about, you know, salaries of more than 7.5 million. kr. shall not be eligible for deduction. I don't really think it's so radical again.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133721	The next brief remark is to Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133724	I just want to say, sir. Carl Valentin, that because you pay Cristiano Ronaldo x 100 million a year, or how much money he gets, and a super league player gets 2 million, doesn't it have anything to do with Ronaldo being a better footballer who creates more value on the field than a footballer who plays in the Super League? That is why there are wage differences, that is, because he is a better player and contributes better to a team and contributes more value to the company for which he plays. That was one thing. The second point is this: does the rapporteur recognise that, with the DKK 1 400 which hit ordinary families, this is actually turning the social arrow down, so that such a tax on a bank account or an increased fee actually hits those who have lower incomes, harder than those who have higher incomes?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133811	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133813	On the first question, I would like to say that Mr. Lars Boje Mathisen has misunderstood me. Maybe he's doing it consciously, I don't know. But of course, when you are a high-profile football player, you contribute more because you are more skilled than a low-profile football player. But I think that comparison is problematic in relation to all sorts of other jobs on the labour market, because a doctor is not necessarily better than, for example, a doctor. a cleaning assistant. They just do something different and pay so differently in our society. Well, the doctor is certainly better at being a doctor, but the cleaning assistant is better at cleaning, and therefore you cannot compare it in the way of football, as you do here. I think it is to simplify it extremely much. To the end, whether this is turning the heavy end down is the answer: No, this proposal doesn't all turn the heavy end down. In other words, it is a question of ensuring that no deductions are made for any of the highest salaries, that an extra tax is applied to the financial sector, and then giving rights to some people in the labour market who have worked their whole lives. That is almost the definition of equality. So I think this is a good policy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133916	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421133917	If the banking sector imposes a tax on having a bank account and it is a uniform bank tax that is added to the customers, then it hits those who have the least, the most. It's factual. In comparison with wages, what is compared here is indeed director salaries, and I hope that the rapporteur thinks it is possible to compare a director with a director of a company. And when there is a difference between directors' salaries, it is precisely because there is a difference between the value that companies believe a director adds to the company. It may be that there is a director who gets 2 million. kr., it may be that someone gets 10 million. kr., it may be that someone gets 20 million. kr., and maybe there's someone who only gets 500,000 kr. It is, of course, an overall assessment of whether the director is better and worth it to the company, just like a football club, which is also a company, assessing whether it plays gives this company, this organization, that value. So, of course, these two things can be treated in the same way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134013	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134014	No, I don't think so. And I believe that in New Citizens one has a slightly naive understanding of how people are paid and that it just always reflects the value that people create. Well, there's obviously a culture of you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, i.e. if you do something for me, then I'll do something for you, too, at the top of the business, and that's also globally. There are a lot of people who have an interest in maintaining some extremely high wages in the industries they are in themselves and in the executives. And that is also one of the reasons why some people are paid extremely high, completely out of proportion in my optics.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134050	The next brief remark is to Mr. Torsten Schack Pedersen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134054	Thanks for the answers. I could understand that it is because the SF believes it is unfairly high wages. So, we have to understand that the Danish shareholders have simply drank from the night pot when they pay such high salaries to a director, because there is no one worth it and that makes no sense. It seems that SF is unreasonable, and therefore the expenses incurred by the company should no longer be deductible, i.e. because SF considers it unreasonable that some earn so much money. That is, of course, entirely legitimate. So I just need to know: are there any other expenses a company incurs because it expects them to be used to generate profits and profits in the company, as SF also thinks it is unfairly deductible? We could take commercials. I remember that SF has a slightly strained relationship with certain types of advertising and advertising in general. Why, then, would the SF not say that the costs a company has for advertising are costs that are disliked, so they should not be deductible either? However, it will be a huge taste judgment that will be drawn down on our tax system when some of the expenses that a company can incur to secure its profits are deductible, while some expenses are not deductible because SF does not like those expenses.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134211	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134212	I just don't see the problem of doing this. By the way, you can still pay your directors extremely high; you just don't get deductible from it. And then it shouldn't be a secret that this proposal is also about scratching some money in. I mean, it's about scratching in some money so you can spend it on something that we think is important, namely ensuring an early withdrawal. That's why you do it. So it is not only motivated by the fact that we think it is unfair that some top managers have extremely high salaries; we think so too, but it is also about the fact that we want to ensure good rights for people in the labour market.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134244	Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134246	Then we come back to who really is going to pay. I could understand from the Social Democrat rapporteur that he hoped that it was the shareholders who, of course, are most of us all in relation to ATP contributions or our pensions. The Social Democrat rapporteur therefore hoped that it would be the shareholders. What does the SF believe? Does the SF believe in the economic wise men who say that this is being passed over in prices, as do all sorts of other taxes and taxes, so that it becomes ordinary bank customers who are going to pay, or does the SF also hope that it is the shareholders who have to pay the bill?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134322	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134324	My best estimate is that it will be a combination. It is fairly typical that some of the costs are passed on to ordinary people, and this will be done in many contexts, but it will also affect companies themselves. I think, for example, that when we do. is talking about this deduction, that it creates an incentive that you don't spend quite as much of the company's money on paying directors by more than 7.5 million. kr. a year. And it can also be positive in the sense that you might be able to use the funds somewhere else in the company than just to secure some very high salaries for management.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134359	Thank you, sir. Carl Valentin of the Socialist People's Party. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. I look after the rapporteur on the Radical Left, but I do not think I can see any representatives from the Radical Left, and I note that the Enhedslisten has been greeted. Then I will see if the Conservative People's Party is present in the Chamber. Neither are you. On the other hand, you are from the Danish People's Party, and so I welcome Mr. René Christensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134433	Thank you for that, President. This is real politics, because when you want something and you say you want something, you have to pay for it too, and that's always what gets difficult in politics. The easiest thing is always to stand and say what you want to give; the hard part is always to find funding. That's the way it was in this case. Because we actually said back, I think it was 15 years ago, that an income principle in relation to the welfare society was a good principle. So we actually see that when you have been on the labour market for 44 years and have paid your taxes and contributed to the community, you have actually earned some rights; then you have the right to retire early; then you have been part of the community. You've used your body, you've used your labor, you've used your intellect, and that's why you get the right. It should be remembered that the right you receive is a right to retire early, that is to say at the level of a national pension, and that you must actually come from full employment. So those who choose to retire early are people who come from a relatively higher salary than the income they will get if they choose early retirement. So who's going to choose an early retirement? It is probably those who are worn out; those who are having a hard time in the labour market; those who cannot be involved in the enormous upheaval and adaptability that one must have all the time; or those who have physical but from having been on the labour market for over 44 years. They're the ones who get this right now because they've paid the quota. In fact, when you have to grant a right, it costs some money, and I would like to say that the Danish People's Party, as a bourgeois party, does not think it is the most fun thing in the world to raise taxes. We have helped to make many tax cuts; we have not helped to raise very many taxes, and I am quite happy about that. It should also be remembered that this is part of the funding. Another part of the funding is, of course, that we get rid of much of the bureaucracy and the things we do in the job centres. There is, in fact, a 10 per cent saving. in the job centres, i.e. 1.1 billion kr., which also goes to finance this new entitlement to early retirement. But what lies here is that the financial sector has been looked at, and, as previous rapporteurs have said, corporate tax is raised from 2022 to 26% when it is fully implemented, and then the right to deduct wages is removed from more than 7.5 million. kr. That is what is going to be funding that, when you have been on the labour market and contributed to the Community for 44 years, and you choose it, because you should not be searched for it, you get the right to withdraw from a pension-like pension. That is why, in fact, we are not very happy with the funding that is here today, but we are very happy with what the money is going to do, and that is why, of course, we can vote in favour of it, because that is the way to make policy: when there is something you want to do, it costs something too, and this is one of the things that has been chosen to finance it. However, I must say one thing. Although we have made the agreement, we have been made aware of one thing about the money we need. After all, we have calculated that it has to be 26% that we have to end up with in order to get the proceeds that we have to put in our hands to pay for our agreement. We're gonna have to make sure it's 4%. At least there are some who claim that they are 4%. is high in relation to achieving the revenue needed to finance our agreement. We'd like to make a fully funded deal. It should not be over-funded or under-funded, but it is certainly important that we do not have anything that over-finances the agreement that has been reached. So we have some questions for that in committee, but there is nothing political in it; it is just for us to land at the level necessary for us to be able to finance the political agreement that is made, which is really good, and which gives the Danes a right to retire. When they have been part of the community for at least four years, they will have the great right.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134835	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are a few brief comments to be made to the rapporteur, first from Mrs Louise Schack Elholm, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134839	Thank you. First of all, I would like to say that I fully acknowledge that the Danish People's Party always has an untiring effort towards the weak in society. So I know quite well, and therefore it is not entirely unknown to me that the Danish People's Party may sometimes have a soft spot. But I just think that this agreement is a pamphlet because it is largely exclusively focused on the trade union and trade union members. It is, for example. This means that, with the financial tax, pensions which form part of the agreements in the red trade unions are excluded, and that is, it can be said, in a sense, a refund. So I think there's some kind of pamphlet in it that I don't like. I think that everyone should be treated equally, and I cannot understand why one only focuses on some. But that's not what I wanted to ask. For some of what I have also always noticed, and in this way I very much agree with the Danish People's Party, is that the Danish People's Party says that you want a more simple tax system, one that is easier to understand, and that is why I just want to hear how this is compatible with the desire for a simpler tax system. Does this bill make the tax system simpler or more difficult?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134946	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421134947	That certainly does not make it simpler. For it is a new tax, and thus it becomes more complicated, and when you have to take 25.2 and divide it by 22 and multiply it again to find out what you have to pay, then at least there are some who have to practice on it, if you have to figure out at home on the calculator what it's going to mean to you yourself. So we fully acknowledge that. But what has been the most important thing here is to find the funding and the compromises you have to make when you want to, and there you have ended up on this model. And I can say in relation to what is also being asked here, i.e. whether it will be simpler, that no, it will not. Will it be much more difficult? No, we don't think so either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135023	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135024	Then I can talk about the second part of this financing, and this is the fact that you can't get a deduction for the part of an employee's salary that, overall, exceeds DKK 6.339.800. in 2010 level. That means counting back to 2010 prices, which means that this is the whole pay package. It's all Warrants and stock, car and all that stuff. Is this something that the rapporteur considers to be simple to deal with?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135100	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135100-2	No, but you can say that today you can get paid in many different ways, and there you can ask whether it really was intended that part of the remuneration should also be all the other things. I guess it isn't really, and it's probably not the tax system that has made it difficult. I guess it's the companies that make it complicated because you have to be careful now to call it holes... suddenly find out that you can give some things to some employees that you don't really get taxed. But then you are taxed a little less than if you had been paid, and therefore it pays better. Well, that's where they say that the tax system is actually quite complicated. But then the question is whether to remove anything. But I do not think we should remove these benefits from a company car or anything else or from making a home available, etc. etc. And, of course, that is part of the salary, because it provides a sum of money available.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135146	The next brief remark is to Mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135150	I get it, sir. René Christensen's speech that this isn't necessarily something that DF shouts hurrah for, but the money has to be found for something that DF wants, and it's this Arnepension. Then let's go back to it. Arnepensionen is named after a certain worker with the first name Arne, who was on his way to early retirement. He had a right to do that. What was so terrible about Arne going on early retirement, so you had to invent a new Arne pension for him so he didn't have to go on early retirement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135225	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135226	What's in this is this principle of profit. And again, it's nothing new. The Danish People's Party said 15 years ago that we would like to have those principles of profit. This is what we would like to have on a great many welfare benefits, also so that people from outside can not just come to Denmark and get welfare benefits. It should also be remembered that this Arne pension will apply to Danes or people who have lived in Denmark for many years and have been on the Danish labour market for 44 years. So we have always been in favour of profit principles, and we also think that if you take away the funding, but it is there anyway, it is absolutely right and proper that we get this model, as we are doing now. With 44 years on the labour market, there have also been some rights as a Danish worker.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135308	Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135309	After all, the early retirement pension also has a principle of earning... you have to pay your pre-retirement contribution from your earned income. So what was the problem? Arne was on his way to retirement, why was it necessary to invent an Arnepension for him? Why would we part-out this Arnepension? Was it just because Mrs Mette Frederiksen had gone to the polls on it, and the DF also felt obliged to do so? Arne could go on early retirement, he was entitled to an early retirement, why would he have an Arne pension?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135336	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135338	Now it is actually called "New entitlement to early retirement," and it is not only Arne who can get it. He certainly became the symbol of it, but the principle of this is that many of those who today are worn out and have not paid for early retirement are those who have to go through this very, very large machine, where you can go in and get an early retirement pension or a flex job or other. But this gives you the right, after a long time in the labour market, to make the choice of leaving full employment. So it's important to remember. You come from full employment, and then you make a choice to go down on a folk pension-like benefit, and you get that right. You don't have that on the other benefits. Yes, on early retirement if you have paid.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135423	The next brief remark is from Mr. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135426	If we put that thing to a page • okay, it was something Arnepension you would like to have • then it's all about funding. And one of the things that I myself think is sometimes after, and I also hope that as a citizen you will be after, is that every time the socialists come up with a good thing that they now want, they always finance it by tax increases and increased burdens on business and in this case also increased costs for ordinary families, which according to Finance Denmark can be DKK 1 400. a year. Isn't it time to stop always financing all the wishes you have then and they can be right or wrong when increasing taxes and taxes? Should we not look at the huge monstrosity we have of a public budget and then find the money in it instead?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135518	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135519	In fact, we have also found a third of the money in the public budget. We're gonna need 3.2 billion. kr., and 1.1 billion. kr. we have found in the public budget. In fact, I very much agree that when you are a citizen, you have to find the money. And now it's sir. Lars Boje Mathiesen from New Citizens asking me, but in other words the Left and Conservatives have just reached an agreement on a national compromise of 18 billion. kr. A year which is unfunded and which will then have to be funded for later. So I just want to say that I am quite happy that the policy that we want to pursue in the Danish People's Party also pays for, and then there are some challenges to it. I fully agree with that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135558	Sir. Lars Boje Mathisen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135559	Yeah, that's right, but because little Jonas is peeing on the fence, little Peter doesn't have to start peeing on the fence either. So that's the thing about just because somebody's done something stupid, you shouldn't start doing it yourself. There I would say that we have the highest taxes in the world, the highest taxes in the world. The citizens out there are having trouble paying their bills right now. Now you add an extra bill to those who probably also want the social arrow to point down, will hit harder in those families who have lower incomes because it is likely to be by a levy that will be fixed, for example, on the one hand. to have an account. Is it not the wrong way to say that these people must now be hit in a country with the highest tax burden in the world?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135638	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135639	When you look at where we find the funding, then the individual will not get the very, very big tax span, which I also hear several rapporteurs have mentioned here today. However, I would like to say that when you impose on some companies whether they are financial companies or some other costs, some of it will also be overrolled on customers, no doubt about it, and in this case it will be banking customers. So I quite agree with that. Let us remember that it is also a liberal market and that there is competition out there. I would also like to say that the financial sector is not, after all, a sector which has a very, very small market in relation to its surpluses. We're hearing about billion-dollar profits per year. Knock. And when you look at the sector as a whole, i.e. add them together, you probably have a profit after tax of about 20 billion. kr. or more. So there's something to take off too. But I do acknowledge that some of this price is also passed on to customers. It will.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135729	Thank you, sir. René Christensen from the Danish People's Party. The next rapporteur comes from New Citizens, so now it's the platform, not the seat, that can be spoken from the Chair, and that's Mr. Lars Boje Mathisen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135755	We have the world's highest tax burden in Denmark. The greed of the majority of the Folketing in here will simply not end. Even in a situation where ordinary families out there, families with children, people who go to work, have difficulty paying the bills, the greed on the part of politicians does not stop in here. This time it's so what you call a social contribution... really it's just christiansborgsk for another tax increase... and it's now going to be imposed on the banks knowing that the banks will of course pass it on to the customers as it is when you put taxes on business. Everyone knows that, even those who have social studies in the eighth grade. But it is as if the Social Democrats and the government say: well, we do hope that the banks themselves take this bill and do not pass it on to the citizens out there. What kind of la-la-reality are you running around in? This is a tax rise that's going to hit ordinary families out there. Finance Denmark says it's about DKK 1,400. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for the excellent work he has done on this subject. At some point I really want this government and the majority with which they are sitting to stop with their greed and say, for once, that it must now be the politicians who tighten their belts. It should not be the Danes who must constantly feel that their economy is being eroded by decisions from in here. That is simply not fair. We are, of course, voting against this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421135954	Thank you, sir. Lars Boje Mathiesen, New Citizens. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Liberal Alliance, and that is Mr. Ole Birk Olesen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421140004	Thank you. After all, the Social Democrats went to the polls to the effect that the post-retirement salary was not good enough for Arne. Arne was to have his own pension, which was named after him. One might say that the early retirement is not good enough for ordinary people and that they are entitled to a pension named after themselves. But that is why we are standing here today, namely that it must then be financed, that it has been decided that a new pension should be made for those who were on their way to early retirement, and also for some others who did not wish to pay for their early retirement by means of early retirement contributions. Now it has to be financed and it has to be financed by the average financial customer in Denmark paying an average of DKK 1,400. more in taxes a year. Because when you impose on financial institutions that they have to pay more taxes, we know that it will then be overturned. That's an increased cost. We also see that when food prices rise, prices in the supermarket rise. After all, it is not Salling who pays for the increased food prices. Similarly, it is not Danske Bank that pays an increased tax. Customers at Danske Bank will pay for this. So that's $1,400. extra a year for the ordinary family in Denmark. On top of that, the government, of a symbolical political nature, says to the companies that you must deduct your expenses from corporate tax, because of course you should not pay tax on any expenses you have. But if you pay a salary to the manager or other key employees of over 7 million. kr. A year, don't pull it off. When I say that this has the character of symbol politics, it is because it contributes about zero kroner to the Treasury. What it does first and foremost is to satisfy the inner pig dog in the electoral segments to which the Social Democracy and Enhedslisten and the SF talk. These are the people who think that if somebody else makes more money than them, it's because they're egoists or they're cheating, or that somehow it's unfair. Because it can't be that some people are so much more capable of making money than they are. It's such a jante-love mentality, where they say we don't believe that people can be so much better. But they are, and we know this from the fact that, as a starting point, business owners will never hire a person of 15 million. kr. a year if they do not believe that person can contribute at least 15 million. kr. in the company's income. It's often much, much more. We see that in some companies the individual director can make such a big difference that if you have the right director, the company ends up being a gold-ridden business. But if you have the wrong director, the company ends up going downstairs and home. I mean, this is a lot bigger than an annual salary of 7 million. kr. Worth it. Therefore, it is also crazy that we have parties in this Parliament that do not recognise that employees in the Danish society, whether they are on the floor of the company, or they are in the director's office because the director is also an employee • must be allowed to have the pay that the company is willing to offer. It's a cost to the company. That expenditure must be deducted, and that is the way it should be. We're voting against this bill. For a very many reasons, this is a really, really bad bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421140345	Thank you, sir. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. Then I can give the floor to the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party, Mr. Rasmus Jarlov. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421140402	Every day with the current government and the red majority is an expensive day for Danish business. Today we have here in the Folketing among others. Parliament adopted three proposals by the government. One proposal is that more companies should be forced to use accountants, which is a huge cost for many companies. The second proposal is that almost all companies in Denmark should now be forced to use an accounting system which costs at least DKr 3 000. a year for even very small businesses. And the third proposal now here is that corporate tax should be raised for banks, so that it is not 22 per cent. from now on, but is 26%. in future, that is, a huge increase in taxation for the financial sector, which the Socialists will then spend on paying for their so-called Arnepension. So it is always tax increases on tax increases, additional burdens on business, and it does not seem as if it is not really something the government has any scruples about. There is no concern about just raising corporate tax by 4 percentage points for the whole financial sector. We think it's incredibly stupid, harmful, and it's going to cost Danish economy a lot of money. We're gonna be a poorer country out of that policy. It is in itself a problem when the tax burden rises. It's also a problem when it's driven by this kind of populism, where you've been out telling a lie that the banks are making a lot more money than other sectors of society, which is not true. And then it is used to introduce a special tax on banks which distort the Danish economy, in the direction that now suddenly some sectors have to pay a higher tax than others, which means that in future they must place their investments where there is a particularly good corporation tax, rather than, for example, those where there is a very good corporation tax. in the financial sector. It is also strange that you go so hard on the financial sector when it is actually a sector that is very important for the functioning of society, but which has been proclaimed by the government to be an enemy of society, some that you can tax and strike, as much as you want, even if they behave properly and actually contribute to the functioning of society. I think it's sad. After all, in the bourgeois government, when I was Minister for Business, we had a policy that we wanted a strong financial sector here in Denmark, because it is good for Denmark that we have a strong financial sector. It's good when the banks do well. And we had a dream that Copenhagen could become a major financial centre, that we could attract other financial companies to Denmark, which had been of great benefit to the Danish economy. It's dying now. In other words, there are no foreign financial institutions that want to settle in Copenhagen or in the rest of Denmark, when one clearly has a government that has declared as its objective to bother the financial sector as much as one can. I really think that we should have kept to knocking down the stumps in the financial sector; hit hard on money laundering, as we did, and beat down on all kinds of criminal behaviour in the financial sector, but keep from proclaiming the whole sector to an opponent; some to be combated, some to be punished with unfair taxes, which have no economic rationale behind them, but which only have a populist rationale behind them that you can paint an enemy image, and then you can try to score votes by demonising the sector. So I think that what is going on here today is very economically wrong, and I also think it is an indefensible populism that a responsible government should have kept too good to carry out.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421140807	Thank you, sir. Rasmus Jarlov, the Conservative People's Party. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. Thus all the rapporteurs who wanted to speak have had the floor, and so I can give the floor to the tax minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421140833	Thank you. Those who listen here must really think that politics actually means something, because every day we have a social democratic government, we help to try to create a fairer society. What I have heard here today from some rapporteurs has almost been a little mockery and mockery of those people who have worked hard on the labour market who have had the hardest jobs with the lowest education. They are now being questioned as to the right to an early retirement pension. Then we can also disagree on funding, and that is quite fair and fair, and that is what we are now discussing. But I really think that the first part is no reason not to recognise that there are some people in this society who have had fewer opportunities on the educational path and who have several years on the labour market. And it is not true that they have the same opportunities to retire as they had at the time with the early retirement or anything else, because those opportunities have been eroded over the years. We have an intention to help them, and then I know that the bourgeois people have the same with the senior pension, but, first of all, it is not a right that you have and, secondly, you have to have a certain amount of labour left in you. The people we're talking about are typically the 3Fs. I know many of those who are operating in Gladsaxe, who have previously been concrete workers and who have had various hard jobs and who, for some, take pills when they get up in the morning and take pills when they drive home. Although on paper they have relatively gentle jobs and drive around mowing grass or something else, it hurts the body when they get home. You know that the time they have as a pensioner is very short compared to ours. They know, because every time someone retires, it won't be that many years before they go to the church for a funeral. They're the ones we're talking about. Then it is true that it is always more fun to spend money than it is to charge money, but if you take the view that you want to give a right to those people who have been the longest in the labour market, and if you also have the view that it should be financed, then the money must come from somewhere. We put a cross on that, and this is so part of the funding. That is why today we have a legislative proposal which translates an important element into the agreement on early retirement rights that we, as a government, have entered into with SF, Enhedslisten and DF, where we now provide part of the funding. This means, of course, that those who for the longest time have worn out and dragged into the labour market will actually have an opportunity to stop before they are worn down to the sock holders. This ensures both a fairer and more dignified pension system. That right must, of course, be fully funded. And I actually believe that we have found a fair and balanced way of financing it. As has also been mentioned, the draft law contains in the first part a financing element consisting of a social contribution from the financial sector, which indeed means that companies in the financial sector have to pay an increased corporation tax. According to the proposal, the community contribution is to be provided by financial service providers under the supervision of the FSA or equivalent foreign supervisory authority under financial law. This ensures an objective and precise definition of financial undertakings. It also ensures that companies in a comparable situation are treated equally fiscally. At the same time, the tax increase is implemented technically in a way that ensures that the companies concerned can continue to benefit from normal co-taxation with the other companies belonging to the group. The second part of the financing element concerns the ceiling on the deduction of the highest salaries. That ceiling is intended to counteract a biased wage development for directors and similar high-paid employees. In recent years we have seen very high wages in the highest levels of management, and here the proposal ensures that the very highest salaries are no longer to be financed by the Community. Then questions have been asked as to why a director who has been appointed to the tune of 15 million. kr. in pay, should not have the right to receive a salary of 15 million. kr., and if you are not aware that someone who has been hired for a salary of 15 million. kr., probably gives a much higher value creation than 15 million. kr. Well, completely, companies should be welcome to hire a director for a salary of 15 million. kr. and if the person is 100 million. kr. Worth it's a good business. I wonder if there is a company out there where they think that, because they cannot deduct it, they opt out of the director they have to give 15 million. kr. In terms of salary, but which is 100 million. kr. Worth it, and then they hire one to 7.5 million. kr., which is perhaps only half worth to the company? Is there any company that would think that way? Actually, I don't think so. So I actually think that premise is crooked. Then there was some debate about footballers etc. So this bill covers all companies and not just the financial sector. So, in those words, I would like to thank you for the debate that has taken place and I look forward to the further consideration of the proposal and to a constructive committee procedure. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141347	Thank you to the Secretary of State for Taxation. There is a request for a few brief comments to be made to the Minister, first from Mrs Louise Schack Elholm, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141353	Thank you. After all, we have discussed many elements, and I am well aware that the government thinks it is quite good to tax the Danes by DKK 1,400. extra a year. But I was reading these hearings, and then I reached a hearing answer saying: "In the Social Democratic Party in the opposition, we were very careful to have all new tax contributions clarified and published before a parliamentary election and, above all, to keep these promises, so that the credibility of this is intact in a future election. Then I thought it was a strange hearing answer anyway, and then I looked at it a little more closely and could see that it was Mr. Henrik Sass Larsen from Active Owners. Then I went in and read the consultation note, and in most places there are rejections of what they say, but there is one of the comments that comes from Active Owners: it is noted that capital and venture funds and so-called business angels do not constitute financial companies after the proposed definition of the companies covered by the social contribution. Reference shall be made to this effect, inter alia: to the comments below that the proposal does not involve the inclusion of alternative investment funds, AIFs. Is that a welcome to Mr. Henrik Sass Larsen? That's just my question.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141504	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141504-2	Well, that can't answer that, 'cause sir... Henrik Sass Larsen answered. But if I have to guess and you ask Mr. Henrik Sass Larsen, if he feels satisfied by this bill, then I'm pretty convinced of it because I've also read the hearing answer that he'll answer no.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141518	Mrs. Louise Schack Elholm.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141518-2	Well, that didn't answer if this is an exception, too. In other words, just as we have excluded the pension schemes in the trade union movement, unlike those in the banks or in private pension funds, we have also chosen to exempt some of the companies which are under Mr Tugendhat's name. Henrik Sass Larsen's umbrella over those in other UCITS?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141543	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141543-2	No, we have not, and I think I would urge the rapporteur to read the whole of Henrik Sass Larsen's hearing response. Because it is quite critical, precisely because the demarcation we have made is indeed the financial companies that are under the supervision of the FSA, and that includes among other things. Some of the companies that Mr. Henrik Sass Larsen today represents. Then I would like to make a comment on the DKK 1 400 which is being mentioned. After all, it is Finance Denmark who has made an inventory that an ordinary family with children in an owner's residence in the case that all expenses are passed on to them will come up to 1,400 DKK, and it is of course disputed both by ourselves, but indeed also by the National Bank, which says that it will probably be a mix of different things. That's why I think the $1,400. is misleading.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141626	The next brief remark is to Mr. Ole Birk Olesen, Liberal Alliance. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141630	Yes, it is always a pity when you have to levy more taxes, says almost all politicians, and some of us think so too. But the money has to be spent on something, and it's such a great purpose, the government thinks. I want to hear why it was very important that Arne not only went on early retirement, to which he was entitled, but that instead he should be able to get his early retirement pension back because he did not take advantage of the early retirement, and then go on Arne's pension, which does not require any early retirement and no Arne's pension? Why wasn't the payback good enough for Arne? Why would he have his own pension, which was invented for him?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141714	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141715	Well, now it is not just the government, but a majority in the Folketing who thought this was a good idea, and I agree that before the elections we were mocked a little for it to be such a bluff and all sorts of other things. But now there is actually a majority in the Folketing that has adopted it, and there are 33 500 who have been granted that right, and there are about 11 000 who have the opportunity to retire earlier this year. So it is the reality for many people, because there is a majority in the Folketing, 90 mandates that have adopted it, and I am really, really, really glad that we have been able to do so. Afterwards, the Liberal Alliance and other bourgeois parties have contributed to the erosion, and when the calculation was made as to whether it was worthwhile for Arne to go on early retirement or to pay for him to retire early, he has done so in public, so I can refer to that, so he chooses to retire early.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141803	Sir. Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141804	Yes, but the whole idea that Arne couldn't withdraw from the labour market was a lie. He could go on early retirement, he'd paid for that, and he could. So this whole rhetoric from the government about the poor people who are worn out but who can't retire from the labour market, with Arne as an example, is untrue. They could be paid early retirement if they had paid early retirement contributions. So why was it very important that Arne was given a more generous benefit than the early retirement pension, which he prefers rather than the early retirement pension, when he was able to retire from the labour market on early retirement?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141840	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141841	But then we are back to what the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party is saying, and that is a little misleading. I am in favour of this, and I am happy to take responsibility for calling it Arnepensionen, but it covers very, very many people. As I said, there are 33 500 who have been granted this right and 11 000 who are using it this year, and with the erosions and deteriorations in the early retirement that have been made, this is a right that you can use, whether you have been on the early retirement or not. And that means that it gives some people who have had the lowest education and the hardest jobs or the longest time in the labour market a right that we are very, very proud to give them and which shows that politics matters and that, for once, we can extend this welfare society to include some of the groups who need it because they have the least years of retirement because they die earlier than the rest of us because they have less time with their families and their grandchildren. And I'm very proud that this has been possible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141931	The next brief remark is to Mr. Torsten Schack Pedersen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421141936	Then it is almost tragic that the longest-time professional group in the labour market is bank assistants. They are the ones who have been easiest in obtaining the right to Arnepension because it is simply a question of the number of years paid into the ATP, and not a question of whether you have had hard physical work, which was what the Social Democratic Party promised. Well, it was just a service information with facts. I asked the Socialist rapporteur who is actually going to pay this tax increase. There I understood that the Socialist rapporteur was hoping that it was the shareholders. Then I can ask the tax minister who, on the basis of his talented officials, is really going to carry the bill of billions of dollars that this bill prints.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142025	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142027	Firstly, I can confirm that it is true that it is the number of years, because it is the simplest model. I can also confirm just as a matter of public education that if you look at the profile of those who have been granted this right, it fits very, very well with those we would like to have the possibility of this right, namely those who have had the shortest education and the hardest jobs. So on the question of funding: I have heard that you have repeated the Finance Denmark's figure of DKK 1,400, which is a figure that assumes that all money, every penny, is passed directly. And if you're gonna make it to $1,400, it's gonna be a family with kids in a owner's residence. We have then questioned that and said that it will probably be a mix of different things, so something in relation to wages, something in relation to owners and probably also something in relation to customers. And if you don't want to take it for good, I can just say that's what the National Bank expects.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142120	Sir. Torsten Schack Pedersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142120-2	I think it is nice that the tax minister now admits that if not all of it, then at least part of the bill will be passed on to prices, so it is the ordinary Danish banker, it is the small master craftsman, it is a startup, it is the entrepreneur who can now look forward to the bank meeting becoming more expensive. And that's where I just sign off for the tax minister to say: well, it's gonna be the customers who pick up at least part of the bill. Thank you for that clarity. Then people who find it more expensive to go to the bank know who to send a friendly greeting to. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142205	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142206	Well, then they'll have to ask their bank if they've come down to the right bank or if they've got a market where there's competition... they can go to another bank that's cheaper. In other words, this argument presupposes that all banks operate as a large cartel, one of which has the same mechanism without competition. And that is where we live in a society where we have competition, including in the financial sector. So I suppose that competition also makes it as few crowns as possible, because you have an interest in letting customers into the store and that it doesn't matter whether you go into one bank or the other bank.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142243	The next brief remark is to Mr. Rasmus Jarlov, the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142246	The last thing the tax minister said here is bullshit. So, the competitive situation does not change by the fact that there is an extra cost in the industry. It is already the case today that banks are competing to be cheap. When you make it more expensive for the banks to run their business, this means that all Danes get a higher fee bill by having a bank account. Everyone sitting in this room gets a higher fee by having an ordinary bank account. This is the inevitable result of the government raising taxes on banks. I would like to hear the reasons for this. The government wants some more money in the box, we know that. The Social Democrats are greedy, they want as much money in the treasury as possible. But why is it the banking sector that needs to be taxed more? What is the reason why exactly the banking sector has to pay 26%? in corporation tax, while all others only have to pay 22 per cent.? Why?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142336	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142337	Thank you. Well, the picture that is drawn of us being greedy tells me, as I hear it at least, that we want that money in, and then we can figure out how to spend it along the way. That's not what this is about. This is about giving a right and giving a right to those who have had the hardest jobs and have been longest in the labour market and, unlike some previous civil governments, we would like to finance it fully. Then we have to find the money somewhere, and why in the financial sector? Well, it is from making a cross between a sector that has had incredibly artificial conditions and some people who have been long in the labour market. I think it's a fair cross. Of course, we could have done it another way. One could have raised the base tax, or one could have reduced the daily allowance, but it would not have been something that we thought was fair and fair.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142431	Sir. Rasmus Jarlov.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142432	Well, I think that the justification for imposing an extra tax on a particular sector that no one else has to pay must be more than just the one that we think it is reasonable, we have chosen that. In other words, the closest I can come to a statement of reasons here is what the Minister of Taxation says about the fact that the financial sector has apparently had particularly favourable conditions in the past. How are they? After all, they have the same corporation tax as other traders in Denmark, i.e. 22 per cent. Today. After all, they do not have very favourable conditions in relation to others. So what are the particularly favourable conditions that the financial sector has had, as the tax minister thinks they should now be punished for having had in the past? What are these favorable conditions?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142515	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142516	After all, we have a number of arguments which have also been listed, and I think that the rapporteur is also aware of them. Let me just mention two of these. Firstly, the financial sector indirectly enjoys a fiscal advantage, and this is, of course, due to the fact that we as individuals have a right to deduct a number of core financial services: interest costs, securities exchange rates, etc. Another part of our reasoning is, of course, that financial services are exempt from VAT, which is also an economic advantage for the sector.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142544	Thank you to the Secretary of State for Taxation. There are no further brief comments to be made to the Minister. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Tax Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142614	The debate is open. The first to speak is the Minister for Transport. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421142626	Today we are discussing a citizens' proposal to abolish user charges on Storebælt. The Storebælt link plays a central role in Denmark's infrastructure. The connection is crucial to tying the country together. Tens of thousands of train travelers and drivers use the connection every day. And we Danes are proud of this impressive edifice. I am therefore pleased that today we will have the opportunity to discuss one of the cornerstones of our Danish infrastructure. The motion for a resolution is prompted by a citizens' proposal which has obtained the required number of statements of support from citizens to be made and dealt with in the Folketing. The motion for a resolution seeks to make it free to use the Storebælt link per year. 1 July 2022. In Denmark we have the principle that driving on our roads is free of charge. The railway companies pay a small railway fee which contributes to the operation and maintenance of the railway infrastructure. That is why, in principle, I also support the intention that crossing Storebælt should be free of charge. I find it strange to live on Funen and could drive free over Lillebælt to visit the family in Aarhus, but if you are going to Copenhagen, you have to pay to drive over Storebælt. On Lillebælt a ferry crossing with payment was replaced by a free bridge in 1935. On Storebælt the ferry crossing with payment was also replaced by a fixed connection, but the user payment is maintained. One might then wonder whether one could have built the link if the Treasury had financed it and thus ultimately the taxpayers. At today's price level, the Folketing should have found about 40 billion. kr. in the state budget. Originally, the price for driving on the Storebælt link should have been the same as on DSB's ferry crossing, but the payment was reduced before the bridge opened for traffic. After all, that is something to be welcomed. Since the Storebælt road link opened in 1998, tariffs have been reduced twice, in 2005 and in 2018. In addition, the commuters were reduced by a commuter agreement in 2016, while the transport allowance for driving over Storebælt was increased. But it's still not free. The abolition of user charges on Storebælt would, as a starting point, facilitate mobility. However, the abolition of user charges would have a number of consequences. This applies, among other things, to: significant economic consequences for the Treasury. First of all, the State should ensure that the debt in A/S Storebælt was repaid, and when the company has no income, there is no money to pay interest and repayment on the debt. On the basis of fair value pr. On 31 December 2021, this would entail a cost of just over 19 billion. kr. There is a high ongoing cost of operating, maintaining and renewing the Storebælt connection. Sund & Bælt has calculated expenditure in the region of 315-515 million. kr. annual. If there is no longer any revenue from user charges, an annual appropriation under the Finance Act would have to be set aside to cover expenditure. With the 1986 Storebælt agreement, it was decided that ferry services should continue to be ensured on Kattegat and on Spodsbjerg-Tår. If it is not possible on commercial terms to operate ferry services here, A/S Storebælt must offer ferry services and provide operating grants. These have been the conditions since autumn 2005 at Spodsbjerg-Tår. If it was free to use Storebælt, it is also to be expected that the ferry service at Odden-Aarhus can no longer be operated commercially. The ferry guarantee would be triggered. A/S Storebælt currently pays just under 35 million. kr. annual operating grants for the Spodsbjerg-Tår route. If the user payment was removed on Storebælt, Sund & Bælt estimates that an additional 250-350 million would have to be paid. kr. in total annual operating grants for ferry services. A number of policy agreements have been concluded to pay dividends from A/S Storebælt to co-finance infrastructure projects in the coming years. So far, a total of 11.1 billion has been distributed. kr. in dividends at current prices. The proceeds relate to the financing of the 2009 Green Transport Agreement and the co-financing of the extension of the motorway on West Funen. Compared with the agreed amount, there is still a total yield of 1.8 billion. kr. In June 2021, the Government and 10 of the Parliament's parties entered into an agreement on the Infrastructure Plan 2035. Here it was agreed that dividends from A/S Storebælt up to 2035 will co-finance the agreement. There is a total yield of 8 billion. kr. in today's prices. A total of some 9.8 billion will be missing if the payment is abolished on Storebælt. kr. to finance the agreed infrastructure development. Either some of the projects would have to be dropped or the money would have to be taken from the Finance Act. This would be noticeable for the Danes. If user charges are removed, drivers, business and public transport will save costs, but it can be calculated that this will reduce the competitive position of public transport. The price reduction will be significantly higher for passenger cars than for rail travellers, and this will reduce rail competition and therefore rail traffic will also be lower in East-West traffic. As has been shown, I have a great deal of sympathy for the motion for a resolution and to make it cheaper to travel between parts of the country will be for everyone, for commuters, for business, Danish families and tourists, but it will cost the state a lot of money, 19 billion. kr. At present, as well as increasing the annual expenditure of the state by less than 1 billion. kr. Broad political settlements have been reached among virtually all parties of the Folketing, which are based on payment from Storebælt, and therefore the government cannot support the fact that using the Storebælt link per citizen's proposal is free of charge. 1 July 2022. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421143308	Thank you very much for your ministerial speech. There are no brief comments. Then we must start with the rapporteur's line and the first rapporteur to whom we should welcome is the Social Democrat rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Thomas Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421143326	Thank you, President. We have to consider a resolution to make use of the Storebælt link free of charge, and the Storebælt link, since it was built, has played a central role in Denmark's infrastructure because it binds the country together. Every day thousands of Danes travel over the connection either by car or by train, and trucks carry companies' deliveries and consumer goods from one end of the country to the other. And then the Storebælt link is also a building that is difficult to be anything but impressed and proud of here in Denmark. The proposal we are debating here today is based on a citizens' proposal which has received more than 60 000 signatures, which shows a great deal of popular support, and I understand that. That is why I think it is good that we have the debate on the proposal here in the Danish Parliament today, when I look forward to discussing a foundation stone in Denmark's infrastructure. In the social democracy we think it is important to have a coherent Denmark. The abolition of user charges on the Storebælt link would, as a starting point, facilitate mobility. However, the abolition of user charges would have significant financial consequences for the Treasury, which would cost the State 19 billion. kr. to repay the debt in A/S Storebælt. In addition, there is a high ongoing cost of operating and maintaining and undertaking renewal work on the Storebælt link. This is an expenditure in the region of 315-515 million. kr. Every year, and without the user fee, it would be necessary to place an annual appropriation on the Finance Act. In addition, the agreement on the Storebælt link back in 1986 decided that ferry crossing should continue between Spodsbjerg-Tår and Kattegat. A/S Storebælt must offer ferry services and provide operating grants, in cases where this is not possible under commercial conditions. If the user fee is removed on Storebælt, the ferry guarantee for ferry services across Kattegat will be expected to enter into force, which means that A/S Storebælt will have to pay further in the region of 300 million. kr. in total annual operating grants for ferry services and in addition the barely 35 million. kr. per year in operating grants for the Spodsbjerg-Tår route, which is currently paid. In addition, DSB would reduce its competitive position and thus lose passengers in East-West traffic. Finally, a number of political agreements have been concluded to co-finance infrastructure projects in the coming years, based on the payment of dividends from A/S Storebælt, including among others. the agreement on the 2035 infrastructure plan that we concluded less than a year ago. With the agreement, we have invested in the road network, public transport, cycling and initiatives for example. noise reduction, charging structure and better road safety for the Danes for many years to come. A prerequisite for this good and broad agreement for the infrastructure in Denmark up to 2035 was a continued distribution of dividends from A/S Storebælt. If the user payment were abolished on Storebælt, there would be a shortage of nearly 10 billion. kr. to finance the current infrastructure development and the result would be that some of the projects would have to be dropped and, alternatively, the funds would have to be found in the Finance Act. This would have a very noticeable effect on the Danes. So to sum up, abolishing the user charge would cost the state 19 billion. kr. Here and now, and in addition to this, there is a noticeable increase in the annual expenditure of the State at the bottom of 1 billion. kr. And let me make it quite clear: if a party that is part of the agreement on investment in infrastructure up to 2035 chooses to vote in favour of this proposal, then as Socialist rapporteur I will consider it as a breach of conciliation and it will be something that I will address at the next meeting of the conciliation circle, so that we can jointly decide what is going on here and whether it is not a breach of good conciliation practice here at Christiansborg. I hope it does not come to that, but I and the Social Democrats are firmly committed to this conciliation situation, which has been worked up for generations here at Christiansborg. In conclusion, although the Social Democratic Party has great sympathy for this proposal, in view of the economic reasons mentioned and the broad political agreements reached, which are based on the payment from A/S Storebælt, we will reject the proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421143759	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no brief comments. And then the rapporteur of the Left is next on the list. Sir. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421143817	Thank you for that, President. After all, the motion for a resolution we are debating here deals with the Storebælt link: a pillar of Denmark's infrastructure, a national pride, we must say. It cost 27 billion when it opened in 1998. kr. kr. The motion for a resolution here, which is a citizen's proposal, we can thank Bent Kloster Thodsen from Hanstholm for and a number of other proposers, and so many citizens have signed it. The proposal specifically states that it must be free for everyone to cross Storebælt from 1 July 2022, i.e. in a few weeks' time, this summer. That's very sympathetic. One can actually say that this is a good proposal, because there is no doubt that if driving across Storebælt was free of charge, it would benefit mobility if you did not have such a barrier where you had to pay and so on. That would be really good. The problem is simply that the proposal cannot be implemented, because there is therefore a golden rule that you have to stand by inheritance and debt, and that also applies to transport policy. The Social Democrats' rapporteur has already explained that the broad majority in the Folketing has chosen to draw dividends from the Storebælt link on several occasions. It's the state that owns it, so you can draw dividends. You may agree or disagree with that, but it is and the money is committed and spent. The last time this was done was in June last year, when all the parties in the Folketing signed an historically large infrastructure agreement to well over 160 billion. kr., and there came about 8 billion. kr. from the Storebælt connection. So all parties have been involved in spending money from the Storebælt link. And it is now the case that money can only be used once, even when we talk about traffic and infrastructure. And if you imagined that with the decisions that have been made, we made it free to run over, yes, then we had to find out in the vicinity of 19 billion. kr. On the basis of the figures submitted by the Socialist rapporteur, Mr. Thomas Jensen, explained, namely the current residual debt of 19 billion. kr., plus the dividends that it is decided to withdraw, among other things. to the major infrastructure agreement. So, no matter how sympathetic the proposal is, it cannot be done with the decisions that have been taken. And that's the way it is. There I shall vote in favour of what the Socialist rapporteur said, that is to say that you cannot both blow and have flour in your mouth. So the parties that are behind the infrastructure agreement, and who with great pleasure helped to spend and dispose of the much money for good and necessary projects around Denmark, must stand by their agreement, for otherwise all decency in here will fall into Christiansborg. There are some clear rules on conciliation and agreements here at Christiansborg, which we in the Left value very much, and I know that all parties do so, so we just have to say that we have to stand by inheritance and debt; we have to stand by the decisions that have been made, where, on the basis of an overall assessment, we chose to withdraw this money. However, as I said, it is a sympathetic proposal. Thank you to the authors of the motion for a resolution. But there is also a good explanation for why we cannot implement the proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421144156	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left, sir. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen. There are no brief comments. Then it is the SF's rapporteur. Here you go, Mrs. Anne Valentina Berthelsen. There are five minutes left for the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421144209	Thank you for the floor. As previous rapporteurs have said, this is a very, very sympathetic proposal, but unfortunately it is also a proposal which we in the SF cannot support for many of the same reasons that have been listed here earlier in the series of speeches. After all, citizens' proposals are extremely important because they allow us to debate some of the things and attitudes that touch the country too, especially in debates where it is difficult and nuanced. And there I think it is really good that we should have the opportunity in here to explain what is really up and down in such a discussion. There is no doubt that it, as Mr. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen from the Left also said, to some extent would improve mobility if it was free to drive over Storebælt. We in the SF also want people, for example. makes it cheaper to drive the train across Storebælt, lowers the price by making orange tickets or using the off peak discount. But it is also the case that the money we owe in relation to Storebælt has not yet been fully repaid. It is also the case that we, as Mr. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen and others have explained, have spent some of the money from revenue from Storebælt on future infrastructure projects. And if we ask some of the researchers who have examined what the Danes think of it, there is something that actually indicates that it is quite right to do so when the money and proceeds go to new infrastructure projects. And that is precisely what we have done last summer in the infrastructure plan 2035 where we have adopted a wealth of new infrastructure projects, among others. with funding from exactly the Storebælt Bridge. We think this is a good thing in the SF, and we would like to stand by it. We believe that we should do the same. If you have been involved in signing up to the infrastructure level 2035 you must also vouch for the financing and the economy if only to point out where the money for those projects should come from. That is why we cannot support the proposal. We think it is good that we have the debate and we look forward to hearing the rest of the speeches.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421144428	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There are no brief comments. Then I do not see anyone from the Radical Left immediately, so we should welcome the Enhedslisten's rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Henning Hylllested.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421144454	Thank you. It probably doesn't surprise anyone that Enhedslisten is also opposed to this citizens' proposal. We would like to sign for impressive support for the proposal with over 60,000 signatures. It is, of course, impressive, but it is clear that when you stand and wave some number of banknotes in front of people, I can understand it, because it is the same as waving people under the nose with a tax relief or something. So I understand that there is a lot of support for this. But it should not belittle the efforts of the proposers and the support that has been created, because it is impressive. But we are against it. I do not need to repeat the arguments that we have heard from the previous rapporteurs and also from the Minister about the whole financing of this enterprise which would result for the state. And then it would no doubt also, if you really did it completely free of charge to drive over Storebælt, generate more car traffic. That is what some rapporteurs call better mobility, yes, okay, but it is basically more car traffic. And in the Enhedslisten we actually believe that there is a need for less It is, in fact, also well known. If it were, we would like to see the infrastructure charges that the train operators charge first and foremost DSB and the rail freight operators pay to drive over Storebælt scrapped. I see that the track has contributed 13.3 billion. kr. over the years, when cars have contributed 56 billion. kr. Then I think we should get used to payment, because the government and the support parties have just decided, in accordance with our agreement to change the car park in a green direction, to start an experiment with road pricing. It will roll over the country in the coming years and we firmly believe that it is something that will spread. This is something that we want to use in relation to road transport. So I think that drivers will at all notice or put up with, or how to express it, that in the years to come you will pay to take advantage of, drive on the Danish roads. There it would be a bit crazy if you did it for free to drive over Storebælt, because Storebælt clearly becomes part of such a road safety system. So also for that reason we are against and think it is a bad idea. I'm done!
ParlaMint-DK_20220421144812	It was just a tough slow-down here. Thank you, sir. Henning Hylllested. There are no brief comments. Then it is the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go, sir. Niels Flemming Hansen, also 5 minutes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421144824	Thank you very much for that, President. A great deal has been said at this stage, and many thanks to the authors of the motion for a resolution for putting forward this proposal again and again: an impressive support for it. It is also a sympathetic proposal, although it is indefensible. As has already been said, an infrastructure agreement has been reached towards 2035 and, as you know, an agreement is an agreement, and one does not run away from it. In addition to what has otherwise been said, I will also mention or not fail to mention the Fehmarn connection, which is also being built as a payment connection, and it must also be the case that driving over Storebælt rather than Fehmarn is not worth driving over, for example, Fehmarn. Hamburg. So there alone we will also run into huge challenges in that direction. I believe that the Fehmarn connection costs about 60 billion. kr. to build, and without having an idea at least right here about how many passengers have to travel over it every year, it will also be surrounded by very, very heavy costs. In addition, the 3.2 or 3.3 million passengers on the Mols line across Kattegat each year and how much they will have to receive in grants per year. Ticket, if you went in and canceled this? I mean, there are about 200 km from Aarhus Harbour to Korsør, and if you just expect a ticket price of 1 DKK. per kilometers, it would be in the vicinity of 320 million. kr. extra, we'd have to go out and figure it out. So, unfortunately, this is just a proposal that cannot be done. However, as I said, an infrastructure agreement has been drawn up which means that we cannot cancel the payment on the Storebælt Bridge. So, unfortunately, it's gonna be a no from here too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145020	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There are no brief comments here either. It is then the rapporteur of the DF. Here you go, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145030	Thank you, President. Like my honourable colleagues, the Danish People's Party cannot agree to the citizens' proposal as it stands. We are part of the agreement on the Infrastructure Plan 2035 and we intend to remain a part of it, among other things. Because a lot of money is being spent on a number of good projects around the country. Although, like my colleagues, I have a great deal of respect for the citizens when they are presented with a citizens' proposal in the Parliamentary Chamber, in this case, that driving over Storebælt should be free of charge, we cannot in any way endorse it. However, we will briefly mention that after 2035 things will look different, and it should be the case that after 2035 we do not use the Storebælt Bridge as a dairy cow, which means that we do not continue to pull money out of the Storebælt Bridge for other infrastructure projects. We have been doing this for a number of years, but it must end. Whether this after 2035 means that we make the Storebælt Bridge free of charge to run over, or that it will be cheaper to run over, depends on a wide range of assumptions. After all, my colleagues have already mentioned ferry connections and the Fehmarn connection and other things, and everything has to be linked, because you cannot look at transport projects in isolation. But if it is for the Danish People's Party, it must be the end of pulling money out of the Storebælt Bridge, which I think the citizens deserve. Otherwise, I agree with my fellow Members and, if I have one thing to say briefly, we also think that if we have agreed to be part of that agreement, we cannot, of course, vote in favour of this citizens' proposal either. Things are connected.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145257	Thank you, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen. There are no brief comments. Then we must welcome the rapporteur of the New Citizens' Party. Here you go, Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145315	The Danes deserve an infrastructure that binds the country together without user charges. The Great Belt Bridge, we probably all know it, because we have passed through the towering pylons that, with their 254 m, tower across the road and are among Denmark's highest points. The lower boxes, which the foundations of the pylons are officially called, were cast in a factory in Kalundborg and transported 70 km to the bridge site. It is indeed an impressive structure and the good fruit of 10 years of combined construction between 1988 and 1998. 14 June 1998 opened the motorway link. I remember it on TV. The total construction costs for the entire Storebælt project amounted to 21.4 billion. kr. in 1988 prices and they have been paid back long ago. However, in 2022 we are discussing whether to make the bridge pay-free. Unfortunately, the link has been used for many years as a form of state overdraft, and that must and must be stopped now. It is time to remove the payment wall between East and West, it is time to let the Danes get the pay-free bridge that they have paid for for for too many years. In New Citizens we generally want politicians to decide less and that Danes decide more for themselves, including more of their own money. We do not want user charges for what binds the country together, and that is why we have been calling from the outset for the bridge charge on the Storebælt Bridge to be completely gone. Infrastructure should not be a hidden and growth-retardant tax project. The removal of the toll will bind our country better together and promote the mobility of both citizens and businesses, that is simply common sense. In New Citizens we say what we think we are doing, what we say we want to see the payment on Storebælt removed, rather today than tomorrow, and that is why, of course, we also support the citizens' proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145543	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There are a few brief comments. First of all, I should like to give the floor to Mr Seligman. Niels Flemming Hansen from the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145551	Thank you very much. Thank you for the message from New Citizens' Interesting. Does this mean that New Citizens no longer regard themselves as part of the conciliation circle from the infrastructure agreement until 2035?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145621	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145621-2	Yes, we certainly do. This is nothing new. We stated it both during the negotiations, but we have also had it as part of our infrastructure policy from the start. And when there are citizens' proposals, remember that citizens' proposals are precisely what the citizens are putting forward, and that is where we have a very, very real attitude in the New Citizens' Party that when there is a citizen's proposal that we think is good, then we mean, on the basis of our position in principle, that we should back it up. So, no, we don't see anyone the most... what to say between being part of the infrastructure circle and wanting a pay-free Storebælt connection.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145659	Niels Flemming Hansen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145700	Good! So with the 19 billion. kr. still to be paid, plus the 8 billion. kr. kr., I think it is all about financing infrastructure agreements forward-looking, the 3.2 million passengers on Mols-Linien, and the evidence it will also have against the Fehmarn connection, it will be as large as I simply do not have the talent to figure out, but how do New Citizens intend to finance that part?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145740	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145741	Now I would like to start by saying that New Citizens are not part of the Fehmarn agreement. We would also have voted against if we had been sitting in the Folketing at that time. But on the other hand, as I said from the outset, we are very happy to sit down at the negotiating table and find them internally. In that infrastructure agreement, we have found lots of projects, among others. Some light rail projects that we would like to cancel in favour of this. At the same time, we have presented an economic plan for a more bourgeois Denmark which is overfunded and where we can also find the money as the years pass. So no, we do not see this as a problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145819	Thank you. Then I would like to give the floor to Mr Seligman. Ole Birk Olesen of the Liberal Alliance. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145821	I just need to understand this because Mrs Mette Thiesen says that New Citizens are doing what they say and mean what they stand for and things and things, but New Citizens have agreed that 8 billion should be taken. kr. from the Storebælt connection and used for some other infrastructure purposes. So, did New Citizen think so when New Citizens made that deal?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145850	Mette Thiesen, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145851	Throughout the course of the negotiations, it was obviously difficult for the various parties to find out what the different parties said, because these were individual meetings. However, we have made it very clear throughout the negotiations that we did not think we should continue to use the Storebælt Bridge as a form of state overdraft. It was part of the agreement; there were a lot of good projects in this agreement; it was a compromise. But that is why we do not stop taking a position that we believe that the Storebælt Bridge should be free of charge. Well, we say what we mean and we do what we say, and this has been our policy all along.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145925	Ole Birk Olesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421145927	Yes, yes, but New Citizens have agreed that New Citizens will be involved in charging 8 billion. kr. from the Storebælt link and use them for some other infrastructure purposes. And that means that New Citizens are obliged to implement that policy because it has New Citizens agreed. There are plenty of things in such an agreement for over 100 billion. kr., which individual parties do not like, but when it comes to the Parliament, one still has to vote in favour of it, because it has been agreed and committed to as part of a large package. And, on the other hand, we must not vote in favour of other proposals which, like, erode what we have agreed. So when it comes down to it and this citizens' proposal is going to be put to the vote, New Citizens will vote well against it because New Citizens have agreed otherwise.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150008	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150009	No, we didn't think so. We did not intend to vote against it, on the contrary. Well, this is basically about us still thinking away and we're not gonna stop thinking that the Storebælt link should be free of charge. We have been saying this all along, and we have been very open about it. And I remember then that there are former rapporteurs, also from bourgeois parties, who said to me, just when we were elected in the Danish Parliament, that the removal of the user fee at Crown Princess Mary's Bro in Frederikssund could not be done, because there was an agreement. But of course it can if there is a political majority in favour of it and if there is a political will to do so. And we have it in New Citizen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150042	Thank you. The next person I would like to give the floor to is Mr Spencer. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150046	Thank you. I have to say that I am a little amazed at the announcement that New Citizens can vote in favour of this proposal, although it is sympathetic; we all think so. There is therefore a mechanism that states that when you sign an agreement and that did New Citizens last June, when you took 8 billion from the Storebælt link and spent them on a number of good things around the country, for example. We spent 1 billion on removing user charges at Frederikssund • How can New Citizens stand here and say that you can support this? Because the consequence is that you have to go out and find some other money, and you can't just throw that out. The funding that New Citizens have in mind must all so this is really a free round, I must say.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150132	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150133	Well, well, I understand that there are some parties that find it difficult that there has been a party that actually stands by the policy they went to the polls and actually says what they mean and does what they say. We just have to take note of that. Well, we're not going to change politics. We still want the Storebælt link to be free of charge, and we would like to sit down and find the money. But I can see that there is no majority in favour of this. This is a citizen's proposal, and it's not legally binding. We have not tabled a resolution on this, and it is not a legislative proposal that comes from the government. This is a citizens' proposal, and we fully agree with the many thousands of citizens who believe that it must be time for politicians to stop using this as a state overdraft and make the Storebælt link pay-free. It's been paid out a long time ago. So we are still supporting that, it has been our policy all along.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150231	Sir. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150232	I think that many people find it a bit strenuous to hear that now at last there is a party in here that stands by what they mean and say etc. So many of us do, but we also make some agreements here at Christiansborg and agreements are maintained. That's basic rule no. 1 in here at Christiansborg. And I have to say that New Citizens are not in the agreement reached last year, and that is why we will of course have a discussion of it here in the conciliation circle at the next meeting.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150300	Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150301	Then we'll have that discussion. Well, I'm completely open to that. I think it is a good thing that it is mentioned that one would like to discuss it here in the infrastructure circle and I would be very happy to take part in it. But this is basically about whether you still stand by what has been your policy all along, and we just do that in New Citizens. This is something that has always been our policy, so of course we still believe that the Storebælt link should be free of charge. Shouldn't surprise anyone.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150333	Thank you. Then I would like to give the floor to the Social Democrat rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Thomas Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150337	Thank you. I would like to remind the rapporteur that the proposal states that this user payment will be cancelled in a few weeks' time, namely on 1 July 2022, and then we will already have a gap in funding from there. We can hear here where the Conservative People's Party, the Left, the Liberal Alliance has spoken to ask questions, and now, as the Social Democrat rapporteur, I am also speaking. And we're not gonna go along with it about breaking a settlement and thinking that you can start cherypicking in an agreement we made less than a year ago. So even now it turns out that there is no willingness among the conciliation parties to do that with the conciliation, which New Citizens would like us to do. That is why my question is brief and clear: if, at the next conciliation meeting, we decide that we cannot have New Citizens in the circle of agreements on "Infrastructure Plan 2035', on the basis that New Citizens appear to be voting in favour of this citizens' proposal, will New Citizens change their position and stay in conciliation and vote against this proposal, so that you can be part of that agreement and help translate all the projects that we are going to implement over the next 12-13 years?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150441	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150442	I think it would be very strange if we were not allowed to be part of the conciliation circle, because we maintain a position that the payment of users on Storebælt should be abolished. But no: we say what we mean and we do what we say.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150456	Thomas Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150457	In any case, I note that New Citizens is a very little credible party which does not stand by the agreements reached with its closest colleagues here in the Folketing. •Infrastructure agreement 2035 • is a historically broad infrastructure settlement where virtually all members of the Danish Parliament vote in favour. New citizens have signed up to the idea of getting some things in the agreement, and then they allow some other parties to get a few things through in other areas, and suddenly the New Citizens' rapporteur stands here and pulls his support for central funding of this agreement. It's untrustworthy and populist.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150534	Thank you. Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150535	In New Citizens we stand by what we have promised the Danes simply. We stand by that; we have said from the outset that it was a wish. We ourselves have not tabled a resolution on this because we are part of an agreement. Nor is it a bill that has come from the government. It's a citizen's proposal. It would be extremely unbelievable as a party elected by the Danes to vote against, when the Danes then put forward a proposal to remove the user fee on Storebælt, with which we fully agree, and which is written in our own infrastructure policy. No, that's not gonna happen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150609	Thank you. The next one to which I would like to give the floor is Mr Spencer. Alex Ahrendtsen, DF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150616	At Christiansborg you cannot blow and have flour in your mouth, and I am a little afraid that Mrs Mette Thiesen and New Citizens are not at all aware of the consequences of what the rapporteur is standing and talking about on the platform. I have great respect for the fact that one will stand by one's policy, but the consequences will be, because that is the custom of Christiansborg, that the conciliation parties can quite rightly consider New Citizens to be resigned from the conciliation, that is, if the party insists that one will vote yes at second reading of this citizens' proposal. Is that really what New Citizens want?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150701	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150702	We were part of a very broad infrastructure agreement and we got a lot of good things with it. We are very pleased both with the agreement we made, but also with the circle of parties in which we sit in the conciliation circle behind the infrastructure agreement. Generally speaking, we are very happy about this, but we have promised the Danes that we will continue to insist that we want the Storebælt Bridge to be free of charge. So no, I actually have a lot of calm in my stomach about this, because we actually stand by what we've been saying all along. It has never been a secret that we were in favour of abolishing the user charge. That has been said during the negotiations, and that has also been said afterwards and said before. So, no, I actually feel quite well about sticking to what we have been saying all along.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150746	Here you go, sir. Alex Ahrendtsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150748	The second consequence is that it will be difficult to invite new citizens to other areas of agreement in other conciliations, because you never know whether you can trust them to vote in favour of them as a conciliation party. I know that all parties want to be involved in agreements at Christiansborg, so I am a little afraid that New Citizens do not understand at all the consequences of their actions right now. It's pretty violent.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150823	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150824	We understand it now quite well. With regard to the agreements we have concluded, we have voted in favour of the legislative proposals that have been put into effect, and we have done so in a way, even if some of them had not grown in our own gardens. We have done so with several different agreements. This is not a bill implementing the infrastructure agreement. This is not a motion for a resolution tabled by new citizens either. This is a citizen's proposal... a citizen's proposal that makes a wish for the Storebælt link to be free of charge. That is the policy of the New Citizen, and that is why we intend to support it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150859	Thank you. Then it is the SF's rapporteur. Here you go, Mrs. Anne Valentina Berthelsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421150905	Thank you. I must admit that I still do not fully understand the position of New Citizens. I can hear Mrs Mette Thiesen denying that a consequence of Mrs Mette Thiesen and New Citizens' votes in favour of this citizens' proposal would necessarily be that we can no longer be involved in the conciliation where otherwise we have happily agreed to spend money from the Storebælt link. It may well be that position, that is, that this should not be the case, but now Mrs Mette Thiesen can hear in this Chamber that it is the conciliation rules and the agreements we have made with each other in here that apply and that we respect. And since the reality is that we cannot both blow and have flour in our mouths, does Mrs Mette Thiesen really believe that it is worth it in terms of her risk of New Citizens losing influence on the infrastructure plan and on all the good things seen in the eyes of Mette Thiesen, which New Citizens have got there, in favour of voting in favour of this proposal, knowing that there is no support for it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151008	Thank you. Mrs. Mette Thiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151009	Well, as I said before, I would think it was incredibly strange if the infrastructure association chose to say that there was a party that could not be part of it because that party consistently continues the policy that that party has always had. It may be that it is just because there are a whole lot of parties that have been sitting in the Folketing for many years behind Christiansborg's thick walls, and then someone comes in from outside who actually stands by what they have promised the Danes. It may be. But no, I just don't see a discrepan. As I have said, we have not voted against a bill coming from the government in relation to the agreements we made in the area of infrastructure conciliation. We don't. We ourselves have not tabled a resolution on this either. This is a citizen's proposal that advocates something that is New Citizens' policy and that has been it all along.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151102	Is there another comment? There is. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151105	Now it is the case that we do not make a difference whether it is a citizen's proposal, a resolution or a legislative proposal. Mrs Mette Thiesen can also hear that in the debate in here. So I ask again: does Mrs Mette Thiesen really think it is worth it, that is to say to get out of the infrastructure conciliation circle in order to be able to vote in favour of a citizens' proposal which she is very aware will not be voted through? We can hear that in the debate in here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151127	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151128	The questioner said before that I didn't get a comment on the fact that we had gladly voted to keep using the Storebælt link as a government overdraft. We haven't been happy about that. We advocated at the very last meeting that we were at least outside that part at least. Because it's just not something we think is a very good idea. It has been done for too many years. But on the other hand, as rapporteur for the New Citizens' Party, I have no problem with, and New Citizens have no problem with sticking to what we have always said, because we say what we mean and we do what we say.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151202	Thank you. Then I would like to give the floor to Mr Enhedslisten's rapporteur. It's sir. Henning Hylllested. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151208	If the matter is so important or has been so important to New Citizens and is so central a part of New Citizens' policy in the transport and infrastructure fields, should it not in fact be said during the negotiations and I very much agree with the criticism of those bilateral negotiations which took place almost all the way through, that this means so much to us, so we cannot be involved in that? I would like to make a comparison with ourselves. We said that we can't be a part of all those new highways and so on. etc., so that's where we'll be standing. We were prepared to say that well, okay, then we are outside the whole deal, if that is the case, that it is not possible. We had a good and positive Minister for Transport, who then got the negotiations in place so that we could actually be part of it. And then we do not participate and do not influence the whole direction; we do not participate in that part of the conciliation meetings. So shouldn't New Citizens really have announced it during the negotiations and said that we cannot do this, because that is so important to us?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151311	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151312	In fact, so did we, and we fought hard for us to be able to stand outside that part, just as we did with, for example, Lynetteholmen, whom I know the rapporteur's party is also outside. There were such several parts in it. So we actually did what we could. But now, in general, I take the view that reason can prevail in the end. We could see that with the agreement on, for example, Crown Princess Mary's Bro, where it was also said that there is a firm agreement, forget it, this user fee will never be obtained. But it did happen anyway. So this was a big compromise. There were a lot of good infrastructure projects in this infrastructure agreement. And then, of course, we have a firm belief that reason can prevail in the end. After all, we stand by the policy we have had all along. Of course, we are still fighting away for Storebælt to be free of charge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151358	Henning Hyllested for the second brief remark. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151401	Well, all honour and respect for it, of course, but the consequence of the position is that, when you are in a settlement at the same time, you are blowing up the financing of the settlement. If it was the case that New Citizens actually got through with it, then you blow up the settlement, you blow up the financing of the settlement. In my opinion, this is at least quite untenable. Some of the money is, of course, like Mr. Kristian Pihl Lorentzen pointed out earlier, gone to another very important point for the rapporteur, namely the exemption from payment on the Frederikssund Bridge. So I think that perhaps somewhere in those negotiations we should have said that this is so important that we cannot. We simply cannot participate in this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151446	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151447	Thank you very much for the questions put by the rapporteur. Well, as I said, it was something we fought for, and we said it very clearly. Then we had to see if we could be part of the compromise solution that came. We certainly thought we could, because we thought it was a very, very good agreement in general. By the way, we still think so. There's no majority in favour of this citizen's proposal. If there was a majority in favour of this citizens' proposal, then I also assume that the parties who wanted to vote for the proposal sat down at the negotiating table and looked at the funding and the economy of it. This is how things work in a democracy. So I just don't see the problem in it, honestly.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151523	Then I would like to give the floor to Mr Seligman. Per Larsen of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151527	Thank you. Politics is very much about credibility and, as we know, money can only be used once. I would like to hear from the rapporteur: is it not the case that, among other things, we do not. Has helped finance this user-pay exemption on Crown Princess Mary's Bridge? It is among other things. conditional on the spending of some money from the Storebælt Bridge, which New Citizens so apparently wants to remove the revenue base from now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151558	Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151558-2	In other words, part of the funding behind the overall infrastructure plan, which is 160 billion. kr., as far as I remember it's a lot, a lot of money is this state overdraft where you take money out of the Storebælt link. And there we just say quite quietly that we would like that money to be found in other projects. We can easily sit down and find some projects within the infrastructure agreement if there is political will and if there is a political majority to do so. So, no, again, I would like to say that I do not really see any discord between you, that you are still clinging to your own policy and that you think you want to abolish the user charge on the Storebælt Bridge and that you are part of this agreement. However, the rapporteur is right to say that it is a question of credibility, and it is also a question of maintaining what we have said to the Danes, and we are doing so in New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151649	Is there another comment? Yes, there is. Here you go, Per Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151652	I just have to say that it is very unbelievable for me that we are calling for exemption from the Storebælt Bridge and, at the same time, the Storebælt Bridge with additional box diving, as the rapporteur says, is inappropriate. I think it is extremely untrustworthy in that way to do one and say something else.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151716	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151717	As I said, this was an overall agreement and, as I said, we are still working away to make the Storebælt link pay-free. However, the rapporteur's party has just reached an agreement to strengthen the defence, which amends the budget law and places the Danes in debt. I would not have thought that to be conservative policy, but I understand that it is apparently.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151739	Thank you. And then I will give the floor to Hans Kristian Skibby, outside the groups. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151744	Thank you, Madam President. I think it's very interesting. After all, we have had these very long negotiations, in which Mrs Mette Thiesen, on behalf of her party, has also been a very good negotiating partner, and we have taken many holmgange around the distribution of the many, many billions that lie in the infrastructure agreement. That is why I am somewhat provoked by the fact that, almost a year later, as rapporteur, we are going down here in the Parliamentary Assembly such a wonderful spring day and suddenly saying that we will not stand by the funding of nearly 140 billion. kr., on which a large, broad majority of the Danish Parliament agreed, among others. to get the user fee away from Crown Princess Mary's Bridge up in Mrs. Mette Thiesen's own constituency. Now the money has to be found to remove other expenses and to finance other capital investment, and then I can understand from New Citizens that suddenly you will not be involved in the funding that is available. Why, though, has it suddenly changed over a morning?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151847	Thank you. I'd say, "Dændusme" is on the verge of being a swearing word. Here you go, Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151854	That was a very fine swearing word, I must say, and it is good to see the rapporteur again. It's been a long time. This is not something that has happened over a morning. If the rapporteur reads the newspapers, if the rapporteur has, moreover, known about the infrastructure and transport policy of the new citizens, then this has been something we have been in favour of from the outset. We haven't changed politics. We mean the same thing as we have done all the time, and that is also why, when there is a citizen's proposal like this, we say: we think that sounds good. Let's get started. Let us sit down at the negotiating table. Let us ensure that the Danes can have the free bridge, which they have paid for in many ways.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151932	Hans Kristian Skibby, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421151933	Thank you. But it also sounds very nice to double the sugar or remove half of all Danish electricity taxes. The only problem is that everything has to be financed if you have a healthy political approach to making a financial law and making construction budgets and, at the very least, managing the whole money box for Denmark. There it is, then, that we are now seeing New Citizens jumping over the fence in good speed without knowing where they are going. You're on your way out of the infrastructure agreement. I would therefore recommend that the rapporteur reconsider this somewhat absurd state of affairs.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152013	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152014	For me, it would be the most absurd state if one were to say one to the Danes and then to do something else. That would be an absurd state of affairs, but unfortunately I think it has become quite common practice in here at Christiansborg, and it is really, really, really sad. We have no intention of doubling the sugar, certainly not, and we have a fully funded plan for a more bourgeois Denmark, which the rapporteur is very welcome to read on the New Citizens' website. It's funded, actually overfunded.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152043	Thank you. Then I would like to give the floor to the Radical Left rapporteur at this stage, Mrs Kathrine Olly. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152049	I am not the rapporteur, but I am a member of the Committee on Transport and indeed I think this is an extremely interesting discussion, and the rapporteur is actually airing some visions that New Citizens have here in connection with it, and if you do not want to find the money on the Storebælt link, the rapporteur says that we can easily find different user payment solutions within the framework of the already existing infrastructure agreement. That is exactly what the rapporteur said three answers ago. So my question is just, and I think that is interesting: what else is it for some places the funding should be found? In other words, when the rapporteur says that we can easily find this within the agreed framework, where is it actually to be found when it is not Storebælt?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152129	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152130	I did not mention anything with some other user-paid places, for fortunately there are not so many of them, but there is Storebælt. However, as I have said all along, we are happy to sit down at the negotiating table, and we can mention, for example, some light rail projects which we would very much like to see closed down. Well, to be honest, it's a really, really bad business to do light rail projects. So it was some of them that we wanted to loop. But if there's a majority for this, let's sit down and look at it. We'd love to do that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152201	Kathrine illdag, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152202	That was an incredibly unconcrete answer. I still think we need an answer as to where that money really is to be found. It is an extremely large amount of billions that we are going to miss here. And now I just come up with a fresh proposal, and I apologise for not getting involved in new civil infrastructure visions in the general political programme, but could one, for example. Imagine that you were involved in some user payment or some payment ring around Copenhagen?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152229	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152231	No.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152233	With that answer, there are no more brief comments. Thank you to Mrs Mette Thiesen from New Citizens. Then we should welcome LA's rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Ole Birk Olesen, five minutes.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152244	In the summer of 2017, in the then VLAK government, we presented a proposal that it should be 25%. cheaper to drive over Storebælt. Later that year we made a finance agreement with the Danish People's Party, where we implemented the financial agreement that it was 25%. cheaper to drive over Storebælt. The toll was lowered by 15%. per 1 January 2018, and the remaining up to 25 per cent. will be implemented as the West Funen motorway is completed, so that when it is completed in 2023, I think it is, the tariff on Storebælt will be 25%. lower than it was when we started this in 2017. You can also see the price difference in that, if we hadn't done this, it would have cost $250. riding over Storebælt. Instead, today it costs DKK 194. riding over Storebælt. So it was our desire to cheapen the journey over Storebælt, which was made there. Should we have done this more? Should we have lowered the rate anymore? The message from everyone with an understanding on this subject was that if we lowered the tariff any more, the economy would go on Fehmarn Bælt. With the 25-percent cut we made on Storebælt, and because there is some traffic moving from Fehmarn to Storebælt, when it becomes cheaper to drive over Storebælt, then the repayment time of the Fehmarn loans is already extended by 3 years. But it could be included in a healthy Femern economy that we extended the payback period on Femern by three years. What was the message was that we cannot go further without destroying the Fehmarn economy. We can, for example. not remove the tariff on Storebælt without destroying the economy of Fehmarn, and it is not because the money paid on Storebælt is to be added to Fehmarn. That's not what this is about. But it's about the economy of Femern assuming that there are some cars driving through the tunnel which is there, and if the cars can instead drive free over Storebælt, there are some of them • not most, but some of those who then take the free trip over Storebælt, because a trip under Femern Bælt for 500 kr. for those drivers cannot compete with a free trip over Storebælt. So that is what we could do, and that means that all the parties who think that we should have a Fehmarn connection and that it should be financed by driving cars and trains through, cannot, of course, lower the tariff considerably more than we have already done. If we now have the situation that we cannot reduce the Storebælt tariff, because it would affect the Fehmarn connection's economy, then we can use the situation to say that let us then do something else where it is a precondition that tariffs are charged on Storebælt, namely to build an Kattegat connection. Because if it is the case that driving over Storebælt is free, then you cannot build a user-paid Kattegat connection that can pay yourself because there are simply too many Danes who would prefer to drive free over Storebælt rather than pay to drive over Kattegat. So those parties that say we need a free Storebælt connection also say that we cannot then implement a user-paid Kattegat connection, and that would of course be a pity because the Kattegat connection is a shortcut through Denmark, where drivers and other people, for example. people sitting on a bus can move much faster between the parts of the country and, at the same time, an Kattegat connection can provide a connection if accidents occur on Storebælt. You can imagine all sorts of things, that is, a chemical fire, a terrorist attack, a great oil tanker sailing into a bridge-pillar that can close Storebælt for weeks and perhaps even months, if it is really bad, and then we have no other connection between the parts of the country that can accommodate as much traffic as we need, and in such a situation it would be really, really useful if we had a Kattegat connection. So it is not only that we can save time and money with an Kattegat connection, but that it can also ensure security of supply for East-West traffic in Denmark, which we need, and for these reasons we cannot vote in favour of the citizens' proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152741	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There are no more brief comments. Then we should welcome the rapporteur of the Free Greens. Here you go, Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152759	Thank you for that and thank you to the many thousands of citizens who have made this citizens' proposal. We in the Green Group have a great deal of respect for this, and we really do have an understanding of the thinking behind it. But in the Greens we do not want more traffic, because traffic is straining the climate and it is straining the environment, and right now it is the case that there is an average of 1.1 people per person. car and that there is therefore a great potential for how to fill the cars. If it had been about making free passage to public transport across Storebælt or to full cars and buses, then we could have supported it. However, we cannot support the idea of free transport across Storebælt, and we cannot support the idea that this money should be used for an Kattegat connection or other roads, and we do not support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152903	Thank you to Mrs Susanne Zimmer. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Transport. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152920	The debate is open and first of all we must welcome the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421152938	First of all, a big thank you to Mrs Susanne Zimmer, Mr. Uffe Elbæk and Mr. Sikandar Siddique from the Free Greens for the proposal for a Parliament resolution on climate-friendly and plant-based food in public canteens. How wonderful it is that climate-friendly food is once again on the agenda in this Chamber. It is no more than 11⁄2 months ago that we last, in the question debate on F 30 on the government's follow-up to the Climate Council's report "Climate-friendly food and consumer behaviour," had this debate. The discussion on climate-friendly food is important and I look forward to continuing that very debate today. I fully agree with the proposers in the direction: we need more people to eat more climate-friendly, more healthy, and that is because our food and especially the animal emits too much CO2 We need to act, and one of the ways is to eat plant-based food and less meat. The Climate Council report shows that the average dancer can limit CO2 by following the government's dietary advice. I also agree with the proposers that public canteen should play a key role in changing the Danes' diet in a more climate-friendly direction. Every day, 650,000 meals are served in public canteens, schools, and day care centers. What if even more climate-friendly meals with more plant-based foods were prepared here? Then we could really move some plate for the plate. And then there is the long-term effect: If you get climate-friendly food every day in the canteen or school, you will probably also be inspired to cook more climate-friendly food at home in the future. For these good reasons, the public kitchens are a crumble in the government's strategy for changing the Danes' diet. The path the government has chosen, I would call the path of inspiration. The ambition is to inspire and motivate the skilled kitchen staff in the public canteens to be creative and cook more climate-friendly food in the future, including food based on plants. That is why we have launched a number of initiatives in this area. Firstly, money has been set aside for pools to promote the use of the new dietary councils in professional kitchens. The government and the parties behind the 2021 Finance Act have allocated 40 million. kr. to a so-called kitchen conversion pool, and we have with the agreement on compensation etc. to mink growers and follow-up industries set aside 7 million. kr. Annually in 2021 and 2022 to the conversion professional kitchens. Secondly, the Ministry of Food has recently launched dietary advice for meals to inspire professional kitchens to serve even more healthy and climate-friendly food. Thirdly, my ministry is working on a proposal to lay down mandatory minimum criteria for the sustainable purchase of food in the state, regions and municipalities. We believe that it is by inspiring, motivating and ensuring a minimum of sustainable procurement that you best move the canteen's food supply and the Danes' food habits. It's the way of the government. You can also choose to go another way, and that is what I would call the ban route. There is the thinking behind the proposers' idea that the Folketing should demand that all meals should be based on plants, including that all lunch meals should be served without meat and fish. This means that no public canteen may serve beef, lamb, chicken, pork or fish for lunch. The famous and legendary Danish child poet Halfdan Rasmussen makes a distinction in one of his excellent children's poems between forbidden land and motelland. And one of the sentences says, even the funniest badut man has it awful in forbidden land. And then comes the morale: Even a gray and sad kalotman, having a wonderful time in the goodlands. I think it is very apt for Danish culture that we prefer a good country to a banned country. And that is also why we have the approach to this proposal that we think it is the route of motivation rather than the path of prohibition that should be taken. I do not believe that banning public servants from having beef, lamb, chicken meat, pork and fish in the canteen for lunch will create a more positive attitude towards climate-friendly food. On the contrary, I fear that if we proceed too quickly and too insensitively with bans, we may run the risk of achieving exactly the opposite of what we want to achieve. There may be growing resentment for climate - friendly food. I fear that bans will demotivate the food professionals. This is because, instead of stimulating creativity and the desire to develop delicious climate-friendly food, bans may risk being perceived as a lack of confidence in the professional skills of the kitchen staff. That would be a shame, because we need to bring the food professionals into the big change. It is absolutely crucial that they are with us. I also see that a ban on meat in the canteen for lunch will result in an actual and significant counter-reaction among the people who use the canteens in the day-to-day, simply because they reduce their choice. Recently we had an interesting and inspiring debate here in the Parliamentary Chamber, which I also mentioned at the beginning, on climate food questions, a question debate initiated by the Socialist People's Party and Carl Valentin, who are also present in this Chamber, and here I noted that we agreed across political divides that freedom of choice should be the guiding principle. My position and that of the government is that there must be more choice in the public canteen. The problem today is that the climate-friendly food, including the plant-based foods, fills too little on the buffet. Therefore, we need to turn up the climate-friendly and plant-based food. We simply need to spread out the palette and make the buffet more varied, that is, have a plus sum game. But what the proposal is proposing here is the opposite, namely that the public service should have limited its choice. The aim should not be for plant-based foods to replace the meat completely in the canteens, because then we have not extended the choice. It should be up to the individual in the cafeteria at 8:00. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. chickpea soup with coconut or ham food. The goal should not be that we never eat meat again. The aim is to make it rarer and to a lesser extent, and instead to eat more green and plant-based. Be aware that this is exactly the point of the government's new climate-friendly diet advice: Eat less meat, more green and more legumes. Dietary advice does not say: Cut off meat so that you can only get vegetables and legumes. No, it's about eating less meat, but not a complete ban. I therefore agree with the authors of the motion for a resolution and with the vision. We need more to eat climate-friendly, including smaller meats and more plant-based foods. This is a development that we must try to promote, but we should not take too large and too fast steps. Because I fear that the banners' route or the Banner's country will lead to the opposite result. That is why the government does not support the draft parliamentary resolution. The government's line is instead that we should inspire that we should motivate public kitchens to cook more climate-friendly food, which in turn can inspire the Danes to eat more climate-friendly at home. I and the government prefer freedom of choice to prohibition. We prefer Mågodtland to Forbiddenland. Thank you for the floor. I look forward to the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421153853	Thank you, Minister. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we are addressing Mr. And ma'am, so it's mr. Carl Valentin. There are a few brief comments, and the first one I would like to give the floor to is Mrs Susanne Zimmer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421153913	Thank you and thank the Minister for recognising that we need to change our diet. Now I would like to point out that our proposal actually provides for meat as an accessory or a supplement for dinner, so it is not the case that we put all meat away. But it just needs to be climate-friendly meat. As you know, beef and lamb are not. Does the Minister not recognise that we are having a serious climate crisis right now and that we need to take drastic measures not to get above the 1.2 degrees that will change our world even more to the detriment of our next generations, and that in that process we may have to take some measures that are a little beyond what you think and want, and that the green meal that can show that you can actually get really good vegetarian food, nourishing and satisfying and healthy, and that it will help speed up development?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154017	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154018	That is precisely why we have presented our official dietary advice, which sets out to eat less meat and more plant-based. I do it myself in the Ministry that the lunches I consume are mainly plant-based. It is also good for my health, and I am very excited about it. I'm just worried that if we put too many bans on it, it can have the opposite effect. That is why we are sceptical about this proposal and prefer a more motivational approach, for which there was broad support, by the way, when it was the case that Mr. Carl Valentin had this inquiry debate a month and a half ago. Another way to go, which I think is exciting and it has been experimented with is that when you go to conferences and other things to register for lunch, for example, you have to state in your registration that you want meat, rather than telling you today that you want vegetarian. There have also been examples of surprisingly many people choosing to say: Well, if the starting point is vegetarian, then I eat it, and then I don't have to choose meat for. So it makes you really move something. That is another way to go, which is more motivation than it is prohibition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154125	Thank you. Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154127	Yes, if we were somewhere else in relation to our climate, I would think that the Minister's proposal was very good, but we are not. After all, we are in a place where we really need action. And then I think that I hear people say, "Wow, can vegetarian food be so good and so exciting?" This is precisely what can be shown in public kitchens, and this is not shown by continuing to make choices. Then it is a long process that we have to go through, and we simply cannot afford to wait for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154157	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154158	On the other hand, it would also be annoying and devastating for the conversion if it were the case that we had a direct reluctance to a climate-friendly diet as a result of this. That is why I think it is the right way to go, the one we agreed on when we had the good enquiry debate a month and a half ago to examine the possibility of having a much wider range of plant-based diets in the canteens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154226	Thank you. The next one to which I would like to give the floor is Mr Spencer. Carl Valentin of the SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154232	Thank you. And thank you to the Minister for the speech. I heard the Minister say that there would be mandatory minimum criteria for public kitchens in relation to the purchase of food, and I think that is exciting. It is perhaps an old agreement to which one refers and one is then developing it now. But can the Minister perhaps lift the veil a little bit about what they are working on here? Because there are a lot of good initiatives that the Climate Council has put forward and that you can do here. And we're pretty busy in the SF that we're gonna get this over with.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154303	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154305	Thank you, sir. Carl Valentin for his commitment and also for his support for the line I have taken in my speech, which is also entirely in line with what we concluded after Mr Valentin's speech. Carl Valentin's excellent question debate here a month and a half ago. In relation to the minimum rules, it is about the procurement policy we have in the public sector, and there it is obvious to look at how we can link this together, so that we think more climate-friendly. After all, it is a question of thinking climate into all the places where we have the opportunity to do so, and I can only call for that to be the policy of the government.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154344	Here you go, sir. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154346	I note that we are not actually being told exactly what is coming, but I am certainly looking forward to seeing it very much. I also think that what the Minister said in his speech on conferences and so on was exciting, i.e. that you should join as a meat eater. I very much agree with that approach, because people have still left the free choice and we know about the behavioral that there will be many more who choose the vegetarian if that is the starting point. Would the government support a proposal that when the government holds events, for example, when the Folketing. Does it have to be plant-based as a starting point, and can meat be chosen if you wish?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154419	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154420	Now this is where the proposals are to come from, a debate we have had several times. Are they supposed to come from the top down, or are they supposed to come from the bottom up? Basically, I think that we have a good tradition in Danish for us to take decisions in a decentralised manner. So I think it is good if it is that in an event group that makes a conference, you decide to say: we want it to be vegetarian as a starting point, and then you have to choose for it if you want meat. But that I have to sit on Slotsholmen and decide how to do everywhere, I don't think it's wise.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154453	The next thing I would like to give the floor to is Mrs Kathrine on Wednesday. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154457	Like the SF's rapporteur, I also noticed during the course of the Minister's otherwise excellent speech that it was mentioned here that the Ministry is making a proposal for green kitchens in the public sector. Let me try to ask you a little more specifically about that, because we know that one of the big knots is something like basic training in these kitchens. Well, how can you actually unfold the green kitchen in a delicious and creative way, so it's going to happen for everyone? So my question is really: will there be money for continuing training in the Ministry's proposal when it comes here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154539	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154541	There were three elements in my speech, but two of the elements were the conversion and retraining of public kitchens; more money has been set aside for this, moreover, following pressure from several of our support parties. So this is something we are working on, that is to say, in the public sector, continuing training is made to think more climate-friendly and to think more plant-based. And then there's this whole thing about how you do it when you have to do public procurement. This is some work we are working on, which is not yet finished. We'll get back to that. I also think that there will be an opportunity to involve other political parties in how we are putting this together. However, there are resources for continuing training, and this is something that we have a great deal of focus on. Fortunately, it also turns out that the various professional organizations that organize food professionals can be 3F working with chefs; it may be the Diet and Nutrition Association that works with economists and such things; and it may be the FOA that works with people in public canteens that are very busy to do this and try to set this agenda.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154643	Kathrine illdag, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154644	A year and a half ago, the government also came up with a catalogue or, as far as I remember, a proposal for green public procurement, and it also stated in that catalogue that negotiations on public procurement would be convened within six months. We still look away far after the calls we haven't been called. I can just be worried that this proposal from the Ministry will be a little bit the same, so that it might be more a friendly cookbook and a suggestion on how to do out in municipalities, instead of going out and saying: "You have to!' In other words, you can imagine, for example, that you are. Takes this into the economic negotiations and puts some specific ones, for example. CO 2
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154721	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154722	Fortunately, you can imagine anything being said soon, and there is no tax or customs on thoughts that is also positive. I very much hope that, for example, we shall be looking forward to it. The negotiations we are going to have with the municipalities will be a free and lively debate on these things. We are working quietly towards making a move on what we are doing in this area, and there we will also seek dialogue with the political parties. I do not have a fixed and finished solution here, but I am very receptive to ideas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154756	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154758	Thank you. I think it's nice to hear about this Mågodtland. And one of the things we can do is save on our health costs, and if everyone in Denmark followed the climate nutrition advice, you could save 12 billion. kr. in health economic gains, and it was possible to ensure that fewer people died prematurely. So it can be said that some effort that brings us closer to that goal is cheap. Counted out at each main meal it is 2 DKK. It doesn't sound like much, but it's 12 billion. kr. on an annual basis, total. So it must be possible to think a little across. That's where I'd like the government to come up with something. For a government with all the ministers it has, it must be possible to come up with the overall solutions. So it is very good that the Minister is referring to what we have done, but there must be reason for us to do something more. It is not certain that those 40 million. kr. for the kitchen change is going to make sure we go all the way. Are there any new initiatives on the part of the government?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154902	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421154903	First of all, thank you to Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen for his support for the whole philosophy of Mågodtland and Halfdan Rasmussen's excellent poem, which emphasizes the culture we have in Denmark that it is the voluntary choice that must prevail. I think this is absolutely essential for us to have positive developments, in other words that there will not be too much bans. Then it is true that you can always do more. Now we have done a great deal, and I also think it is worth signing for some of the results that have been achieved, because it is worth it, among other things. are some that have been created, not least thanks to Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen's own party, Enhedslisten, but also other support parties that have made suggestions to promote this agenda. We can imagine more there, but I would just like to warn against the fact that the one thing that is going to happen is that we need more money for this area. Because there's a whole lot of dynamics and creativity that can move something. And then it's true, as Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen says that if you turn it around a little, you can see these things as an investment rather than an expense.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155007	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155009	If you looked at it objectively, everyone riding a bike should have 6 DKK. per kilometers, because that is what society saves in health spending, by doing the good work. I cannot help thinking that during World War I such a nutritionist was employed to advise. It was a food adviser who actually brought Denmark through the first world war in a way that then had fewer livestock but actually ensured healthy nutrition for the whole population. Are we where we need to set up some experts to give us some good advice?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155042	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155043	In fact, we have a lot of excellent experts. And that's absolutely right, sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen suggests, that in a time of crisis that we are in now, it is worth looking at whether what you have to eat to save some money is not the same as what you have to eat to live climate-friendly and healthy. And it actually is. Then you choose to live according to the diet we have in Denmark, you can save money. Similarly, with food waste, there is money to be saved. Unfortunately, on average 60 meals are thrown out each year. Dane.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155119	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. This means that we are embarking on the rapporteur's round. First, it's sir. Brian Bressendorff, Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155131	Thank you for the floor, President. First of all, I would like to thank the authors of the motion for a resolution for giving us another opportunity to discuss this important subject with the Folketing, namely climate-friendly diet. As the Minister rightly pointed out, it is not so long ago that F 30 was treated here as a follow-up to the Climate Council's report on climate-friendly food and consumer behaviour. The climate situation is one of the greatest and most urgent tasks of our time, and the food system is of great importance in this context, just as it has for both our environment and our health. Therefore, it is also important that we have a conversation about climate-friendly diets both now and in the future. Social democracy shares the intentions of the proposers. More Danes must eat more climate-friendly. Public canteens play an important role here. That's because every day 650,000 meals are served in public canteens, in our schools, in our day care centres. In the short term, however, we do not believe that the way to ban is the right way to go, because we believe that such a ban on beef, lamb, chicken meat, pork and fish in the canteen can have the unintended consequence that there is a reluctance to climate-friendly food. This applies both to the Danes, whose choices are limited, but it also applies to the skilled staff in the public canteens, which we may risk being demotivated because we from the centre make rules that can be seen as a lack of confidence in the skills of the kitchen staff. Instead, we believe that we should go another way, the way of inspiration, as the Minister really called it, where we stimulate creativity and the desire to develop delicious climate-friendly food. It is freedom of choice that is the guiding principle. And our position is that there must be more choice in public canteens. Today, the problem is that climate-friendly food, including plant-based foods, fills everything, far too little. The aim is not that we never eat meat again, the goal is to make it rarer and to a lesser extent, and that instead we eat more green and plant-based. This is precisely the point of the government's new climate-friendly dietary council, which benefits the climate and benefits the health of the Danes. The food sector is an area in which we see rapid and positive developments with great popular and political support. This concerns us here in the Folketing, just as it also concerns many Danes, and it is positive, because our food habits in public kitchens and at home are crucial for the green transition. The potential is really big. That is why it is also an important discussion to have: how best to get to where we want to go. I am pleased that the government has launched a wide range of initiatives to support the Climate Council's recommendations for a climate-friendly conversion of public kitchens. The Ministry of Food has recently launched dietary advice for professional kitchens, which can help stimulate the desire to cook more climate-friendly food. Let me conclude by saying that I am pleased that we are taking this dialogue, because we need a sustained and multifaceted effort to change the Danes' food habits in a more climate-friendly direction. In the social democracy we agree with the vision of the proposers. We need more people to eat climate-friendly, less meat and more plant-based foods, but we prefer freedom of choice to ban. The authors of the motion for a resolution want to see major and rapid steps down a road of bans which we may run the risk of acting counterproductively. That is why the Social Democrats cannot support the motion for a resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155544	Thank you. There is a brief comment on Mrs Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155547	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. The rapporteur talks a lot about voluntaryness. Will the rapporteur be able to guarantee that a vegetarian or a vegan will be able to have a nourishing and satisfying green meal in any public kitchen in Denmark at any time?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155608	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155609	I don't think we can do that today, no. That is clearly a direction we must take. It is, of course, in order for us to move in this direction that all the measures I have just mentioned in my speech have been taken. But I think it is true that today you will be able to get out in many places where it will be really hard to find a good vegetarian alternative. So it is quite true what the rapporteur somehow indicates here. We still have a big step to take in eating less meat and more plant-based and in ensuring that the choice, whether you are a vegetarian or you like to have a little bit of meat, is great for everyone.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155648	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155649	Yes, and what the rapporteur himself responds by saying, I think is a huge problem. Because there is actually not freedom of choice everywhere, and that means that people are in the situation every day that they have to bring a lunch if they do not want to eat meat. And then, in relation to freedom of choice: the Government and the Danish Parliament pass many laws in which there is no freedom of choice. In other words, wood-burning furnaces from before 2008 must be outsourced, and pesticides are limited to how much can be sprayed. There is no freedom of choice. So why can't we make some decisions in this area as well?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155726	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155728	I think we need to show a clear direction where we want to go, and then we need to be careful that we do not end up along the path of bans where we can actually risk ending up in the opposite place of what we really want, i.e. that the resistance to this is going to be greater than we can really imagine. So yes, I share the wish that we move into a more plant-based direction, but I do not believe that the ban path is the right one to go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155754	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we go to the next rapporteur, who is Mr. Erling Bonnesen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155810	Thank you. Freedom to choose what to do on the plate is central to me as a Leftman and for us in the Left. Good consumer information from the authorities is important, so you can put together a varied diet, but that certainly does not mean that we should restrict the Danes' free choice in terms of diet and the composition of the diet. In the municipalities, the regions and the institutions, too, we must have free choice to choose for ourselves what to do on the plate and to put together the diet plan of the week. Several choose to eat less meat. This changes what is being demanded also in the public canteen. But I am quite sure that you can easily manage the composition of the diet locally, which will also naturally differ from one region to another. The freedom of the Danes to choose for themselves is central to us in the Left. We do not need state dictations about how many vegetables there should be and how much meat there should be. The individual citizen, municipality, region and public institution can easily find out for themselves. We talk a lot about freeing the public sector and having confidence in local management. We should also have that when it comes to preparing the weekly lunch plan for the canteen or school meals, and that is why the Left is voting against this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155944	There is a brief comment on Mrs Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421155946	Thank you. And thank you to the rapporteur for a liberal party. Of course, freedom is a great deal, and in fact we in the Free Greens agree with it a great deal. But where is the voluntaryness of those who do not eat meat? Well, is it okay that someone can get into a public kitchen and then actually can't have a vegetarian meal if they're vegetarian?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160011	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160013	I simply do not think it is related to the question put by the questioner. First of all, the questioner signals that we in the Left actually agree on a liberal approach, and then she goes exactly the opposite way in the matter. It doesn't add up. But I am glad that at the beginning there was a signal that we agreed, but then we did not really agree. It doesn't add up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160034	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160035	No, I said far along the road, and that doesn't mean everywhere. Well, of course the Left doesn't feel that way either. But what is the rapporteur's view of voluntaryness, that is to say freedom to choose a green meal? And how does the rapporteur view the importance of the diet in terms of climate impact?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160058	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160059	Well, I think it is falling more and more apart for the questioner, because then the questioner starts by saying far along the way and then comes up with some questions about yet dictating it. It doesn't add up. I have answered clearly and clearly as a Leftman that we want the freedom to choose for ourselves and that in the individual institutions we are best placed to put together the diet plan of the week ourselves. More clearly, I do not think that can be said.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160122	Mrs Kathrine Ollldag, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160123	I have chosen to take the floor because I was somewhat provoked by the fact that the rapporteur is merely criticising the question that is being asked and that comes from a completely legitimate place, namely to ask what it really means to be liberal when it comes to food. Freedom to choose you stand by a buffet, and then there's nothing but meat in what you're facing. And as a vegetarian or as a vegan, you don't have the freedom to choose. Then you have to go home hungry, or you have to bring a lunch. It can't be liberal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160152	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160154	Now I think you have to look very long for a buffet where there is only meat all the way through and nothing else, which was what was at the beginning of the question. But I'm quite sure it's at least my own experience from my time in the municipal sector that you're best in the individual kindergarten, in the individual nursing home or elderly centers and elsewhere in the public institutions' kitchens to discuss yourself: What do we want to put together the diet plan from in our institution next week? And that can vary, even over the year. And it fits very well with our positions in the Left, which is a liberal party, that you take the discussions locally, which may be different, and in this way you get the diet plan of the week put together. It's my experience that it works best.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160237	Kathrine On Saturday.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160239	I'm gonna try again. As a 15-year-old vegetarian, I can calmly say as a first-hand witness that it happens very often that you come to a public buffet where there is nothing that is not meat in. So what's liberal about a buffet where there's even sprinkled bacon on the salad?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160300	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160301	Well, I have clearly stated our position, that is to say that the discussion is being held locally, and I am quite sure that this is also being done in the specific situations mentioned by the questioner. There you have to take up the issue locally and try to assert your influence and say that you want to influence how next week's diet plan should then be put together. That is the way forward in a local democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160323	Then it's mr. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160325	I do not see that this is a simple and clear liberal policy either. I would therefore ask the rapporteur's liberal heart: does the rapporteur think that, for example, use is made of it? The state canteen must have an opportunity to eat anything other than meat in a buffet?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160342	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160343	The questioner says you don't understand my liberal attitude. No, and I can also understand that we are different parties, and that is fair enough for that. But I reply as clearly as I can that it is best to deal with locally and that we want the choice to choose, and I have now explained several times on several questions here, that you will of course take that discussion locally. It is quite clear that there will be different regional approaches to how to put together a diet plan, and there may also be differences over the year, but that is, if I may say so, not in the proposal that lies here. There you will go a more compulsive path. But we do not want that in the Left. So I completely disagree with that. That is also why we are voting against this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160424	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160426	Well, if you're in quite a part of the country, for example. in all East Jutland, in the state canteens choose only to serve buffets with meat, that is to say to ensure completely that people have no plant alternative whatsoever and that it is only meat, would the rapporteur think that it is quite all right and that it is just up to the individual to decide that everyone in that part of the country can only eat meat in the state canteens?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160502	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160513	I can understand the author's approach to trying to make it completely black or white. So black or white, I don't think it is. But in those situations, in those places, in the institutions where it is, we can say that the users of the canteen want there to be a different composition of the diet plan of the week, one also has the opportunity to influence it. And that's the way to go in such a case.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160517	Then we would like to thank the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. We are moving forward in the rapporteur's line, and we have now come to Mr Beazley's report. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160527	Thank you. I do not think I can stress enough how important it is for us to eat more plant-based. It is for a whole series of reasons. This is particularly so because we are in the midst of a climate crisis on which our food systems have an enormous impact. It is also because we are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, and one of the major problems in this regard is that we remove nature for the benefit of fields, and the reason why we have so many fields is that we have to produce so much feed because we eat so much meat. That is why we need to eat much more plant-based, and that is extremely important. We are also in a situation of antibiotic resistance, which is an increasing problem. The WHO mentions it as one of the greatest threats to human health, and 70%. Of all the antibiotics we use, we use for animals, and when you take animals out of the equation and eat some plants instead, you can also reduce antibiotic consumption. That is why it is important. And then I have not even talked about all the animal ethical aspects, future epidemics and health aspects, which have also been mentioned. So there are really many good reasons why we need to eat more plant-based. That is why I am also extremely proud that we in the SF have succeeded in pushing the government quite a lot on this agenda. This is both in terms of ensuring a plant fund, further training of kitchen staff, which was also mentioned earlier in the debate, and green dietary advice, and now we are also examining the possibility of getting an offer of plant-based food in all public kitchens. There is also a climate label on the way and several other things. We can also feel that the mood of the people is moving, and that many other parties here in the Danish Parliament are moving forward • my own party has also moved forward. There's really a lot going on in these years. But I also think that we should go further than that. We need clear climate targets for public kitchens. They must set clear targets for how much we need to reduce climate emissions from the diet. We also need to ensure that the climate impact of food is reflected in the price, that is, a tax on food, so that there is an economic incentive to eat greener. We need a high, uniform CO2 so there are a lot of things we need to do and this agenda is important. However, precisely because this agenda is so important and because there are so many good things we can do, it upsets me a little that the Free Greens are today making a proposal which, in my optics, seems rather ill-thought-out. We agree with the goal; we must eat much more plant-based, preferably as much as possible, and I also dream that one day we can get there, that the food in the public kitchens is primarily plant-based. We are in agreement with that. However, by deciding very suddenly, by the end of this year, that all meals in public kitchens should be based on plants, I think we will breed a huge counter-pressure, and if we are to reach in any way where the Free Greens want us to go and where we also want us to go, we must make sure that people are ready and the institutions are ready for that, and there must be a massive approach to it. We have to show people how amazing plant-based food can be. We show them that, among other things. by making offers of plant-based food in public kitchens so people can choose it for. We also show this by creating progressive climate objectives so that public kitchens serve more plant-based food and so that people are presented with it. Then they must also be ready for it out in the public kitchens. There is a need for continuing training, and it would require massive continuing training if this were to be carried out here. In the last sentence of the proposal, it is said that it is also necessary to do so, that is to say to have a lot of continuing training, but it is not being financed. So an unfunded proposal has also been made here, and I think that is a pity. There is really very good progressive policy that can be implemented if you want to ensure more plant-based food in public kitchens. The Climate Council has made a whole series of recommendations in an excellent report, which we also had a question debate on the other day, and I think we should fight for some of the many good solutions that we have and which we know to work instead of something a little ill-thought-out, which I think we are proposing here. So from the SF's point of view, we fully agree with the intention, and we have plenty of good ideas on how to ensure that we go this way, but we cannot support the concrete proposal from the Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421160957	There is a brief comment on Mrs Susanne Zimmer, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161000	Thank you to the rapporteur for taking this issue seriously. The rapporteur mentions climate objectives and also says later that there must be objectives. And I also hear that there has to be something that shows that we are going in the right direction. Does the rapporteur have any idea what such an objective might be?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161023	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161025	Yeah, you could, for example. say that the emissions from the diet in the public kitchens should have been reduced by 25%. by 2025 and by 50 per cent at the latest. by 2030 at the latest. We have proposed this in concrete terms in the past. We have also gone further elsewhere. In Aarhus, for example, SF has. I would like to say a few words on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). reduction already in 2024 and then there is otherwise freedom of action, in terms of how to do it. And I really think it is very wise. In other words, you set some significant objectives that ensure that you have to serve much more plant-based in the public kitchens, but that you can then assess in the individual kitchen how you want to translate it. I think that is a better approach, which I also believe will be more understanding of locally and which will actually give some of the same. In other words, we are still getting rid of the reductions, because they are the ones we decide, but exactly what is to be served for lunch, as the Free Greens go in here and propose something about, we are not interfering in. We say you need to reduce, and then you have to figure out how.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161128	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161129	Thank you. Does the rapporteur not think that it is pushing a lot with regard to our climate, in other words, that something should be done? So when the rapporteur says that there must be a 25% reduction. in 2025, does SF think it is ambitious enough?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161147	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161148	As I said, we have been willing to go further elsewhere too, and we have also done so in Aarhus, where it is already from 2024. I could see that you could go further than that. I just do not think it is wise to put forward a proposal which will require a total change in public kitchens very quickly, for which the population is not ready and for which the kitchens are not ready either. And I think there are so many other instruments that could be used. And if you put a tax on animal food, if you made an offer of plant-based food in public kitchens, if you made the objectives I have proposed, you will achieve much of the same as this, but in a better way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161225	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we go further in the rapporteur's line to Mrs Kathrine Oldag, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161244	Thank you. Last night I was at a general meeting in Herning. And it was not because it was the Radical Left General Assembly that vegan sandwiches were served; it was simply because this community house in Herning, located right in the middle of the city, has decided to replace its whole kitchen with vegan meals. And then you've made sandwiches that have a vegan version. It looks like completely fish fillets or meatballs, or whatever it may be. It just tastes at least as good, maybe even better. I am happy to see that my homeland has also begun to find out about this, and that it is not just a metropolitan phenomenon anymore, but that it is actually something that gets even the oldest of the old, tanned radical men to excuse me, sitting in such an assembly, to think that vegan and plant-based food can actually taste really, really good. And then I believe that we are actually a solid step forward when it stops being identity policy, but really it just starts to be about food that tastes good. So to the proposal: I actually read a little differently from what I can hear from the Minister perhaps doing, namely that there is quite a lot of space and space for different types of methods. For example: The proposal mentions the possibility of adding animal products, but that is right after a long description of how the whole kitchen is to be converted into exclusively plant-based. So I guess I feel a bit like the SF's rapporteur, so it's a little cycling in this proposal, and it seems a little cliffy. And there I think you just have to be significantly sharper if that is how we have to agree on how this is going to happen. Because in the Radical Left we have the approach, which we also share with the Minister and with the SF rapporteur, that this should not go the way of bans. Because if we go the ban road, we're not gonna get the West Jutlanders. We are never going to serve vegan French hot dogs at the fair in Aulum, if it is the case that this is not about the food being delicious, instead of having to have a lot of bans on what it is you are not allowed to do. That is why we are going to reject this proposal, but we also believe that when it comes to green public kitchens, these are the kitchens for which we, as politicians, are actually put in the world to take responsibility. I guess we're feeling a little different than the Left. After all, we have an opportunity as politicians to set the direction for the public kitchens. It is the case in the municipality or region of the hospital that it is exactly where the citizen meets a different kitchen and some other meals than at home. That's exactly where the inspiration can come from. That is where you can see that a meatball based on beans can taste amazing in a way you never imagined. So for us to see and that is also what I was trying to ask the Minister a little bit about the government should agree to put some slightly stricter requirements on the municipalities. After all, we saw a year and a half ago that the government presented a proposal on green public procurement, which we have not heard so much about since. It will be a little bit about the proposals, it will be a little about the nudging. We could actually imagine going into an economic debate and saying that we want the green kitchens to have a specific reduction target, by the way, exactly as the SF's rapporteur explained, that we have done in Aarhus, where some years ago it was said that we would have 25%. less meat in our pots for the citizens. And then what happened? After all, it happened that the citizens did not actually notice. It was just still tasting away really, really good. And what you saw reduced, and the money saved by it, you put in organic food instead, so the budget went up. You just ended up getting more tasty food, which, by the way, had the same nutritional value as before, but simply reduced. So, as far as I'm concerned, the Aarhus model should be rolled out throughout Denmark, but it would probably also require that we from the Danish Parliament press a little bit harder instead of it being only about good suggestions and cookbooks. By the way, we have a minister who must be very praised for having really taken ownership of this agenda, I think, but it could just get another tooth. So in those words, we are at least rejecting the proposal as it stands here, and then we hope to be able to continue the dialogue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161737	There is a brief comment on Mrs Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161740	Thank you and thank the rapporteur for a passionate speech. I think especially the story from the kitchen in Herning is really nice. And that's what we in the Free Greens are thinking that our public kitchens could do in everyday life so that we could get this development pushed up, because people just realize that you can get so much good, delicious nutritious food, and that you actually feel really good after eating that meal. Does the rapporteur not see that having it rolled over all public kitchens could help to create the good stories and developments in the homes and in the sausage stall on the animal show, which, by the way, is not part of our proposal here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161826	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161827	Yes, but that is the way we get there, because the Free Greens want to ban the road, and we are probably more interested in just taking it up in the helicopter and saying: in the public sector we have to reduce CO 2 2 2 2 So for the Radical Left it is CO 2 Moreover, we fully support the purpose and intention of the proposal here, but that is not the road to ban.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161907	Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161907-2	Thank you. The rapporteur mentions reduction targets, as did the SF rapporteur. Where are the ambitions of the Radical Left, compared to what numbers are going to be on these reductions when?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161920	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161921	In our own climate initiative, we have proposed 50-percent reductions in public kitchens by 2030, so that is at least the intention of this. With the exception of two municipalities, all municipalities have concluded the DK2020 agreement, where they conclude the Paris Agreement's climate objectives about 50 per cent.'s reduction. So if they just do that, they will be in line with the intentions of the Radicals as well.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421161954	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we move on to Mr. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162008	Thank you. There are a lot of good examples around the country that people work in the public sector to change their diet. Among other things, they do. In the region hospital Randers, where an ecological line has come very far, and where you also have the choice for patients to choose between different types of food, and it is interesting that there are actually relatively many of the sick who choose vegetarian food when they are going to be healthy. We have also seen municipalities such as Aarhus and Copenhagen and others, which have gone ahead and started this change over to more ecology and have gained experience that if you are skilled at reducing food waste, if you buy local raw materials, the season's raw materials, and if you use less meat, you can make good food for the same budget. Sometimes it requires that you have some continuing training of employees, and there is thus experience that when you go in this direction, you actually reduce the absence of sick people in those jobs. There are plenty of good experiences that happen out there without the Folketing going the way of bans and requiring you to do the same everywhere. And that is what makes Enhedslisten not think that we should vote in favour of a proposal which defines that the government should put forward a bill so that all lunch meals are served without meat and fish. Well, what's next? Should we then define in the Folketing that you can only eat 1 dl yogurt in the morning if there is food somewhere? There must be limits to how detailed we should go into things. I think that prioritising a CO2 and that would make it easier for the diet budget in the public institutions to be maintained if meat consumption were turned down. I think it is important that we have come to the conclusion that there are climate foods councils, and I also think it is extremely interesting that we can achieve a health benefit for society of 12 billion. kr. a year, if it is the case that everyone does not go and become vegetarians and vegans, but just follow the climate nutrition advice and turn down the amount of meat they eat and get more of the proteins from eating pulses. The voluntary path along that path seems to me to be the most important. Then I have also noted that we have had some good negotiations on the Finance Act, where we have allocated funds for the conversion of kitchens. I think we should look again at the 40 million. kr., we put off last time, that's enough. I imagine we need to spend more money on that. If you can save 10 million. kr. I guess you can afford to spend 100 million a year. kr. to retrain some kitchen staff. Then I also think that in our agricultural agreement we were given a lead, which gives priority to a new plant fund and that, in that sense, there will be some funds that will encourage us to produce more peas and field beans on the ground and that there will also be the possibility of support in the food industry to develop products. I have a great expectation of this being a success because I find that there are a number of companies in Denmark who have noticed that there is a new niche production, which in time is probably not a niche production that can produce anything other than steak; it can then be a plant steak. So I think that there is so much out there that is in process, and I think that we are deeply dependent on the commitment of, for example. The people who work in the kitchen. We depend on it being the good taste that wins. And there I do not think that such obsessive proposals that there should be no meat or fish at all on the lunch plate are the way to go. I am in favour of what is being used being much less animal, but I am against this going down the path of prohibition. Then I also note that the proposal states that more resources need to be spent on upgrading the kitchen staff, and then there is no direct funding in the proposal. I also note that when we arrive at the evening meal, it may well be something where there is a little meat, but there is not at lunch. I do not think this is the most thorough proposal I have seen in the Parliamentary Chamber.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162510	There is a brief comment on Mrs Susanne Zimmer, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162512	Thank you to the rapporteur for having a positive attitude towards the change. My question is really just: does the rapporteur think that things are going fast enough? Is the transition to green and plant-based diet fast enough at this stage?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162528	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162529	Well, I can easily see that more could happen, but I just have to note that a lot is happening and that there are actually a lot of good processes going on. And when I look at what we got into the agricultural agreement on the plant-based, I really think we have left a trail and given priority to more than a billion to develop on the plant-based track of agricultural support. So there are really good clues in it and we are facing the need for CO2
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162608	Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162609	Yes, it is quite true that it is important that there should be more plant-based production in agriculture. And I hope that it will go inland, but it can also be exported, and that, of course, is fine. What is Enhedslisten's ambition, compared to how many percent plant-based diets we have to reach in public kitchens?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162634	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162634-2	Well, we don't have a total number on that. We have a clear priority: we need to be a climate-neutral society. How little meat can then be served in the public kitchens, we do not have in our trade catalogue. I don't have a number to throw out on that field.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162655	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we move on to Mr. Per Larsen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421162705	Thank you for that, President. And I would also like to thank Mrs Susanne Zimmer for making this proposal. Now I know Mrs Susanne Zimmer as a friendly and sociable person, even from North Jutland, and I was actually a little disappointed when I read this proposal. In fact, I think it is a bit totalitarian when you go in and want to ban meat and fish in the canteens. I do not think this is the right way to go at all. There is a great development in people's food habits, and it works quite excellently in the way we see the developments around us, where you try to respond locally to the demand that exists for the food that is being served. In the canteens they can see what kind of dishes are emptied first, and then it's a really nice way to regulate things. And I think we should hold on to that. This whole thing about going in such a powerful way and saying that you should not be allowed to serve either meat or fish in public canteens, I think is simply too far to go. I also think that when we talk about climate-friendly food, it is a little violent to put fish on. There's an amazing good eat in fish. I love fish myself and eat it as often as possible. Fish are really climate friendly. And I'm also wondering if we should just leave the fish out in the sea... that would be a shame and shame. I certainly eat very often meat-free too, because I think that suits me too, but I would certainly like us to go the way of volunteering in relation to the food that we have to offer in public canteens. Then I am also a little puzzled that when you place so much emphasis on climate neutrality and reduction of CO2, it is true that organic production all the other things equal requires a little larger area per year. This is not the case in the United Kingdom, but in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom. And if this proposal is brought out where we have to phase out meat, then we have no livestock production anymore in Denmark, for example, and that would mean that you do not have all the nutrients that livestock production contributes to, among other things. for organic production. And if it is the case that you are going to grow the fields completely without the supply of nutrients from livestock production, then you are going to get into a form of spawning of the soil, both in the short and long term. It would be limited how many people we would actually be able to feed in the future if it is the case that we have no livestock in Denmark. So that's gonna be a no thank you from us. We think we should be consistent in many ways. Among other things, you have to... reduce food waste. We have a huge waste of food, among other things. from the canteens, and of course we need to focus on that. And then we have to make sure that we do this local conversion, where you can see in the public kitchens what kind of dishes are emptied the fastest, and thus also meet the needs of those who frequent these canteens. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163045	There is a brief comment on Mrs Susanne Zimmer, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163046	Yes, and that is actually just a brief comment. I just want to point out that it is the lunch menu that is without meat. Our proposal provides for the possibility of eating meat and fish for the evening meal. So we haven't shut down all animal production with this proposal. Something else is in relation to ecology: there are many different views on how it is in practice, but that is another discussion, I think.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163115	Per Larsen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163117	Yes, it is, but we also have to look at reality and say that if it is the case that we do not add any nutrients to the crop, then the yields will be very limited. And that is where it can be said that we have a good success with very organic production, because nutrients are simply injected through the feces that come from livestock.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163144	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments, and that means that we move on to the next rapporteur, Mr President. Søren Espersen, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163203	Today we are discussing B 164, which is a proposal for a parliamentary resolution on plant-based and climate-friendly public canteens. The aim is allegedly to require the government to introduce legislation requiring all public canteens to serve meals with a low climate image. In the Danish People's Party we do not believe that the Folketing should decide how climate-friendly food a public canteen should serve. We believe that if the individual Dane wants to eat climate-friendly and plant-based, then already today there are plenty of opportunities for canteen to meet such a wish. To deprive canteens of the possibility of serving meat is also to rob the possibility of serving a large part of the Danish food culture and thus an intervention in the Danish common understanding. There is nothing to prevent that the individual Dane today can choose a lunch with a lower CO2 Most canteens have salads and other vegetarian offers, and if there was no demand for meat, the canteens would not serve it, so there is evidence that there is a desire and a need for the canteens today to serve meat. It may well be that the average Dane eats twice as many animal products as the average world citizen. On the other hand, we are also one of the happiest countries on earth. We do not see it as an end in itself to become an average country in the world. If anyone wants to eat a lunch with a lower climate impression, they must be allowed to do so, but it should not affect all the many Danes who want to eat meat, as they always did. In the future, it may be that the food habits of the Danes change to such an extent that public canteens naturally replace a menu with a lower climate impression, but this must always be done on the individual cantine's own initiative. Should this happen, it would be quite natural for agriculture to convert itself to produce in a different way than they do today, but it is not something we should decide in here from Christiansborg. As one might sense, we say no to the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163413	There is a brief comment from Mrs Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163416	Thank you to the rapporteur. DF is part of the 70-percent objective in relation to the reduction of CO2 Should that objective not hit into public kitchens at all? Or how does the rapporteur think about this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163432	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163432-2	No, we believe that in a way this is so private that it is something one must try slowly to change, and one can do so with an influence on others. I'm not saying that at all. I just don't think it's something that needs to be thought through in relation to a law. It seems very • what should we say dictatorial, and we do not think we should discuss that when it comes to something as important as this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163451	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur I see in the Chamber is Mr. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163512	Thank you, President. I wasn't really registered for this debate, so I wasn't going to go on the platform. But I was told that I was allowed to, and the reason why I am doing it is that I think it is a little too bad that this proposal from the Free Greens is getting such a bad reception. Well, we're behind in reducing our CO2 emissions really, really, really. According to the scientists I listen to, the 70-percent objective is not enough. We're going up to 80%. What I miss is that there are some of the rapporteurs who say what needed to be done so that this could be done. Then it may well be that there should be a longer phasing-in plan; it might well be that we should set aside some money for the training of the chefs and dietary counsellors who have to realize this. There may be many things that need to be done here, and I also think it is a powerful proposal that comes very quickly, but then let it come within 3-4-5 years, and I miss a bit of a will that we try to figure out what really needed to do so that something like this could succeed. Because we are so far behind in achieving our objective. So the reason I came up here was to give this proposal a little bit of wind as well. Because the only intention that this is about is to live up to what we have all decided, and that is where we all have our hands on the hot plate, and it is about reducing at least 70%. Thank you, Mr President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163658	This gave rise to brief comments. First, it's from sir. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163701	Thank you. I think I'm a little out of line with sir. Torsten Gejl's analysis, in relation to whether this is going to be a tough one, because I have actually seen several of us rapporteurs talking quite warmly about where you want to go, and I have done so myself. I have also tried to tell you what it takes to get us there. I mean, it's about us, for example. We want a high tax on food, and we are therefore willing to go further than Enhedslisten, who wants a CO2 We also want them to have high objectives, and if, for example, we want them to have high objectives. In fact, it is more to be reduced than if all diets in public kitchens followed diet advice. Well, we're going down further than that. We have also said that we must have an offer of plant-based food in public kitchens so that we can always choose for it. So I really do not think that we are giving it a hard time because we do not want it politically. What I find problematic is that it does not seem so well thought out. It has not been prepared to implement it, nor has it been financed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163810	Here you go to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163811	I also find that the SF is using this motion for a resolution to tell you all the things you do and you want to and you can, and you think you have done yourself, and I actually miss it, and say that it may be that there are some weaknesses in this, but that, for God's sake, you have some ideas to solve it. That's what we're here for. We are here to say that if this does not work in the way it should, now that it is about common objectives and a path that we all want to take, then it can be done here and here, and there I just think it is a pity that the parties are using such a motion for a resolution and their speaking time to say what they have done themselves, and then the proposal is pouring down the board without saying what should be improved in the proposal in order that we might be able to implement it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163858	Sir. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163859	Well, I'm not just saying what I've done. I have mentioned that too, but I also say what we should do. In other words, we need to have high taxes on food so that the climate impact of food is reflected in the price, we need to have binding targets for public kitchens for how much to reduce the climate load, and we need to have offers of plant-based food in all public kitchens. After all, all these things are something that has not been adopted and that we want to push the government on, so I think we are really going to come up with concrete solutions as an alternative to this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163931	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421163933	But how much of that does the rapporteur himself believe, for example. when it comes to the levy on food? In other words, yesterday we saw how climate taxes landed at half as much as the climate bourgeoisie had proposed, so what will happen when we come in the autumn and there will be a proposal for how big CO2 it will be hardly very good, and instead of pointing to the fact that it might work, I just miss some more concrete improvement proposals for the present resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164010	Kathrine Ollldag, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164012	So let me take it up because I really do miss something concrete from the alternative. I do not think there is any shortage of concrete proposals from the SF. I would also like to say that the Radical Left is the only party, apart from the government, that has come up with a fully funded climate plan that we came up with here last autumn, and which we are currently in real political negotiations on in relation to the realisation of many elements, including what to do for public kitchens. We also had a CO2 so what exactly is the alternative missing? Well, we're a Parliament that's in full swing. There is a thundering development out there, even in Herning you serve vegan sandwiches, as I explained. I can say as a vegetarian that there is really a big difference between being a vegetarian today and then 10 years ago. So what is the alternative really missing?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164112	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164112-2	I miss, for example, that the Radical Left had the courage to reduce Danish meat production when it negotiated CO2
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164127	Kathrine On Saturday.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164127-2	If that agreement were to be broad enough, we could not get through with that wish either. That is what we wanted to see in this context. We are fully in line with the rapporteur and with the alternative in that meat production in Denmark should be reduced. We use far too much of our land to produce feed for animals that we then eat. It's a strange way to channel kilojoules into people when in reality you could just live directly on plant-based diets. So in this way we are completely in line with the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164159	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164200	Well, I'm glad to hear that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164204	Then it's Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164208	Thank you, and thank you, to the rapporteur, for nonetheless deciding to go to the platform and approach to the proposal. Now the rapporteur said that we could perhaps spend 4-5 years to get there, but could we also talk in the negotiations about perhaps three years, and then look at what we can do here so that we can achieve something that really is batting? Because that's what we need. We can't keep waiting for this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164230	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164231	One of the things that has been said here from the platform today is that if you do it extremely suddenly, you risk a counter-reaction. You risk people feeling that someone is taking something from them. I can feel the reaction to this debate in the public. A lot of people feel that way: don't you fucking touch my steak. So, in order not to get a counter-reaction, I think it needs to be massaged into the population with some really, really good arguments and, above all, we need to be able to predict what the advantage of this is. Whether it takes three years or five years, I don't know, but I'm ready to try.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164307	Thank you. Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164313	Now the rapporteur is referring to the population, but if we now look at the climate bourgeoisie and what they brought here in the spring, they are beating hard that they need some change. They call for changes they call for action in this Parliament. So I think we could actually turn it around and say that we are foot-timing in here in relation to a large part of the population, of course not all, but a large part.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164340	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164341	Well, actually, I totally agree with that. If we succeed in phasing out meat from the public kitchens of 3-5 years, I think it will be a huge step. I really would, really thought that was fine.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164400	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. Then we have come to the rapporteur for the proposers, Mrs Susanne Zimmer, the Free Greens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164418	Thank you. Yes, we have a huge problem with our climate. It is urgent to change our way of life if we are to achieve a world in which our next generations can live. And there is plant-based diet part of the solution. We have a farm that spends 60%. of our land area, and of the 60%. 80% will be paid. used for animal production. In round figures, agriculture emits about a third of our CO2 A sustainable diet is largely based on plant-based foods and to a limited extent on animal food. Note that I didn't say it wasn't about to. We say precisely in our proposal that it may be an accessory for the evening meal and that there must be room for exceptions if that is needed on, for example, the evening meal. hospitals, nursing homes or settlements. By reorganising our agriculture we can create more space for our nature... a nature that is hard pressed into place. And it will be an agriculture that can produce more food units in less place, so that we can easily produce plenty of food for us and also to export. Research indicates that the climate impact on global agricultural production can be reduced by 45%. in 2050 if all the world's citizens eat a sustainable diet. At the same time, it will be able to release 60%. of the world's agricultural area, which could be used for other purposes, e.g.: afforestation and nature. We eat a lot of meat in Denmark. We eat more than the other European countries on average and we eat much more than an average world citizen if we compare ourselves with them. In fact, we eat twice as much, and if you take into account that we have a great many people in the world who do not eat very much and who eat very plant-based, then we have a strong footprint on our climate. It's in that light that this proposal needs to be seen. We need a plant-based diet and a climate-friendly diet and that it is targeted at those who have to eat it. This is of course important in relation to if you look at when people are in hospital, as I mentioned earlier. It will benefit the climate if we can remodel part of the diet in Denmark, and just as important will be that it contributes to our health, as I have also heard Enhedslisten's rapporteur mention several times. 12 billion kr. You can save a year if you just follow official dietary advice. What we just want in the Free Greens is to speed up. We need this in the interests of climate, the environment and health. For example, the UN climate panel, the IPCC, proposes that the global food system, which stands for 30%. of the overall global greenhouse gas emissions, helping to limit our climate change. I therefore put forward proposals on plant-based and climate-friendly diets in public canteens and, moreover, I refer to the comments accompanying the proposal and recommend it to the kind treatment of things. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164759	Thank you. There are no brief comments, which is why we thank the rapporteur. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the draft parliamentary resolution be referred to the Committee on the Environment and Food. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164814	The debate is open. First, it is the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421164839	First of all, thank you very much to the proposer, sir. Torsten Gejl from the Alternative, for this proposal for a parliamentary resolution on the elimination of beef and lamb in public canteens. Again, as in the previous debate, I would like to acknowledge that climate-friendly food is on the agenda here in Parliament. This is a very important and very relevant debate. And now I will perhaps repeat myself a little: I fully agree with the proposer in the direction that has been put forward in this proposal. We need more people to eat climate-friendly, and that means that we need to do something about meat consumption. We have to, because beef and lamb in particular emit too much CO2 We have to act, and one of the ways is that we eat more plant-based foods and less meat. I also agree with the proposer that public canteen should play a key role in changing the Danes' diet in a more climate-friendly direction. But I am, as I have just argued in relation to motion for a resolution. B 164, sceptical of the ban route. I had this reference to Halfdan Rasmussen and Mågodtland and Forbiddenland, over there I certainly prefer Mågodtland, and I am very skeptical of Forbiddenland. In motion for a resolution (Doc. B 177, therefore, it is the idea of a ban that dominates. So there is too much Forbidden land and too little Mågodtland. It is proposed that beef and lamb should be abolished in public canteens. I believe that we risk demotivating the canteen staff by not relying on the professional skills of their profession. And I fear that a demand from the Folketing that public employees should not be presented with beef and lamb in public canteens will lead to opposition to climate-friendly food out there. That would be a shame. What we need is the opposite: positive support for us to change our diet together and voluntarily in a climate-friendly direction. Again, the goal should not be to eliminate beef and lamb from our diet. The aim should be to create a change in behaviour which means that we voluntarily choose to eat less beef and lamb. That is exactly what is behind the recommendations in the new climate-friendly dietary councils. Eat more green, more legumes, cut down on the meat, and especially limit beef and lamb. These are some of the good messages that are here. It is not: cut off meat, so there are only greens and legumes left. So it's Mågodtland, it's not Banishedland. That's why the government doesn't support this draft parliamentary resolution. Let me refer again to the very good question debate No. F 30, initiated by the Socialist People's Party and Mr. Carl Valentin, where we agreed to investigate the possibility that in public kitchens a 100 per cent can be chosen. plant-based meal, if you wish. There is the possibility that you can choose it for yourself. We think this is positive, and we are then examining the economic consequences of this in order to implement it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, On the other hand, we prefer the route of inspiration we have taken from the government, and it is about inspiring public kitchens to cook more climate-friendly meals and inspire the Danes to eat more climate-friendly food. That's the way to change our diets, we think. Thank you for the floor. I look forward to the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165256	Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Torsten Gejl, the alternative. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165258	Thank you. I have just been to the Ministry of Health, where it is proposed to ban the sale of alcohol to young people under 18 years of age. This is a perfectly clear prohibition policy. Here we are proposing to phase out lamb and beef, which is not only a health problem like alcohol; it is also a problem for nature; it is a problem for the environment; it is a problem for the climate; it is a problem for animal welfare. This means that we want to use bans when it comes to young people not being allowed to drink alcohol, but we must not use bans or phasing out when it comes to a problem that is seen as the greatest challenge in our time. What's the point?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165348	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165349	When we have the health glasses on, I think that Mr. Torsten Gejl understands that e.g. alcohol and smoking are far more harmful than eating a burger with beef once a month or eating lamb up to Easter. It can be completely without health effects if you eat it in moderate amounts • no doubt about it. What is at issue here is that it can have a climate impact. Yes, and that is why we have made some very clear dietary advice, where we recommend eating less meat and especially eating less beef and lamb, but completely removing the possibility that sometimes you can serve a steak or a burger or a steak or something else or lamb up against Easter, we simply do not think the way forward. We think it is a good idea to be able to choose, and we can see that far more Danes like this choose plant-based diets.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165451	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165452	I admit that alcohol is more harmful to health than meat, but along with meat consumption there are huge implications on climate, on nature, on the environment, on animal welfare. We see this as the biggest problem in our time, and there the Minister only wants to go around Mågodtland and not into Bangetland, but when it comes to reducing alcohol, the Minister wants to go into Bangetland. I don't think it makes sense. Nor do I think it makes sense that the government in the dietary councils clearly recommends that we phase out lamb and beef, but it is just served in the state's own cafeterias.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165529	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165530	First of all, I am delighted that Mr. Torsten Gejl admits and, as such, disassembles his own first argument, stating that smoking and drinking are of course more harmful to health than eating beef and lamb, which can be an excellent diet if you get it in moderate amounts. So it is positive that he makes that realization. Finally, I must stress that it is not the case that we are proposing to phase out beef and lamb in the food boards. All we're saying is eat less of it. And that's the balance that has to be in it. It may be good to have that option, as long as you eat a little less of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165606	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165607	Thank you, and thank you to the Minister. I think it is a small step to say that beef and lamb must not be eaten. If I am to come to the Minister anyway, what will it mean if we said that it was at lunchtimes and that we were allowed to eat it at evening meals in places where people live?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165628	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165629	However, as I also mentioned in connection with the previous motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Susanne Zimmer, we believe from the Socialist Government that it may be reasonable for the canteen itself to have any influence, in other words, in the decentralised stages. We can be sceptical about the fact that all decisions have to be taken from the top down. This may be necessary in some contexts, for example: in relation to very, very harmful tobacco smoke or alcohol, there are very clear lines, but where it is possible for decisions to be taken in a decentralised manner, we think it is preferable. I believe that development is going to go in the direction of eating far, far more plant-based diets, including in public canteens. You will eat less meat, and you will eat less beef and lamb in particular because it has a climate effect. This is also what many of the food professionals themselves need to be inspired to do, among other things. on some of the courses that we have spent money to ensure they can get so they can make a green transition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165730	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165731	Now, like the Minister, I would like to start by saying that it is at the risk of repeating myself. After all, we are in a situation where we really need some action to counteract the climate change that is sweeping over us, and I think that we need to do something to deal with it and to make it move quickly with a green transition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165754	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165755	Right there I fully agree with Mrs Susanne Zimmer. After all, we are doing a great deal and we need it to happen quickly. We're probably one of the countries that does the most in this field. When I speak to my European colleagues, they are surprised at how offensive we are in Denmark. And when I conduct the diet policy, which is government policy, and among other things. If we advertise our dietary advice and other things, there are many politicians here in the Danish Parliament who think that I am going too far. So what I'm trying to do is strike a balance between the point of view, such as: Mrs Susanne Zimmer has, and the view of others in the Folketing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165832	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. This means that we are embarking on the rapporteur's round, and that is first, Mr President. Brian Bressendorff, Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421165843	Thank you for the floor, President. First of all, thank you to Mr. Torsten Gejl from the Alternative to put forward this proposal for the elimination of beef and lamb in public canteens so that we can continue the debate on ensuring a more climate-friendly diet in public canteens. I shall try to be as brief as possible so that I do not repeat myself too much from the last resolution. Social democracy agrees that we need more people to eat climate-friendly. This means that we need to cut back on meat consumption and eat more plant-based foods. This is because beef and lamb in particular are at the top of food, which emits the most CO2 Once again, it is absolutely crucial that we get the public canteen into this, both because they can do a great deal in the short term and because in the long term they can come up with the inspiration that we need to get into the Danes' homes. However, following the discussion we have just had in connection with B 164, I think it is clear that we are sceptical about going down the road to ban, as this proposal proposes. I believe that it will demotivate the canteen staff in their work on the green transition, and I believe that limiting the Danes' ability to choose for themselves what they will eat will mean a greater resistance to climate-friendly food. I believe that the opposite is needed instead. Positive incentives are needed for us to change our diet together and voluntarily in a more climate-friendly direction. We must inspire the public kitchens to cook more climate-friendly meals and Danes to eat even more climate-friendly food. So to sum up: I believe in inspiration and not ban. Freedom of choice is the key word here. That is why the Social Democrats cannot support the proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170052	Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170055	Thank you. There's one thing I'm still wondering. This is the fact that, in many areas, people want to go down the road of prohibition that loves the government's ban route, but not in this area. We risk huge implications for the climate with billions of climate refugees, nature is incredibly damaged by the fact that 60%. of Denmark is covered by agriculture, our seas and fjords have oxygen loss due to emissions from agriculture, and animal welfare is, to say the least, appalling in agriculture. Despite all the things, plus that meat isn't the healthiest thing in the world, you don't want to go the ban road in this area. Does the rapporteur not understand that this can be difficult to understand?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170143	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170144	Now Mr. Torsten Gejl just before, that when he thought that we went down the ban road elsewhere, it applied to the alcohol area. Of course, I shall not be able to say what has happened in the negotiations over in the Ministry of Health, as I have not been there myself, but the last proposal I saw from the government was not now about a ban on alcohol; it was about the fact that, as a young person under the age of 18, it was not possible to buy it. It's a pretty big difference in my world. In this case, that's not what this is about. It is about going down a road of bans where you will no longer be able to have beef and lamb the times when it makes good sense to have. You want to take the freedom from the individual canteens in order to motivate and be able to make the meals that you see it right to do, and to pass on the motivation to the Danes. I believe that this may end up having the quite opposite effect of what you really want, and I know that you cannot ask counter-questions, but I cannot help wondering whether there is not a fear elsewhere than in myself as to whether it cannot have that consequence.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170251	It was such an elegant way to do it. I would also like to ask counter-questions, because these are short remarks here. Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170257	That is a justified fear, and that is also why we are doing it extremely cautiously. In Copenhagen in 2019 3 per cent. of the municipal food purchases lamb and beef. It is very, very little, but they derived 45% together. of CO2 So this is a careful adjustment. We can go home and eat all the beef and lamb we want, but now that it is the government's advice that we should phase out lamb and beef or at least eat much less of it, can the rapporteur not see that it seems a little double moral that we are just serving it away in healthy state kitchens?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170332	Thank you. Then it is the rapporteur's turn. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170334	No, I can't, because I don't think it's a small step to make a ban. Because it sends out a very, very clear symbol that it is from in here that we have to decide how to cook your food, and not least what to put in the head. I just believe that this is the path of inspiration we are going down instead of the path of prohibition, and this proposal is going in the wrong direction.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170357	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no further brief comments, and that means that we will move on to Mr Van der Klaauw's report. Erling Bonnesen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170411	Thank you. Freedom to choose what should be on the plate is absolutely central to me as a Leftman, and good consumer information from the authorities is important so that you can put together a varied diet, but that certainly does not mean that you have to limit the Danes' free choice of diet. In the municipalities, in the regions and in the institutions, too, you have to have free choice to choose for yourself what you want to eat. Several choose to eat less meat; it changes what is then sought after in the public canteens. But I am quite sure that you can manage it locally yourself. The freedom of the Danes to choose for themselves is central to us in the Left, and we do not need state dictations about how many vegetables or how much meat should be on the plate. The individual citizen, municipality, region and public institution can easily find out for themselves. And we are actually talking a lot about setting the public sector much more free and having confidence in local governance. We should also have that when it comes to preparing the food plan and diet of the week for the canteen or school meals, which is why the Left is voting against the proposal here. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170533	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. This means that we move on to Mr. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170541	Thank you. Thank you to the alternative for the proposal here and, in general, thank you for your cooperation on this agenda and also for taking the lead at the time. I do not forget either the historic role of the Alternative in this fight for meat-free Mondays and all these things that have helped to kick these debates off. And you keep kicking debates into action, and I think that is important. I also think that this proposal kicks off an important debate and highlights something important: the very violent climate footprint that is from beef and lamb. It is extremely important that we limit our intake of it, and I could talk at length about why, but I've almost just made a speech with all these points about plant-based foods, so I'm not going to do it quite that far this time. I would say, however, that I think there are other and wiser ways in which we can limit emissions from food in public kitchens than by banning the serving of beef and lamb. If, for example, we are going to do something like this... In other words, some progressive climate targets were adopted instead of binding targets on how much less food in the public kitchens should be derived and, at the same time, a meat tax was introduced which would affect beef and lamb, but also all sorts of other kinds of meat, but in particular this, very, very hard, which would result in virtually no beef and lamb being served in public kitchens, because we simply cannot stay within climate budgets and there is also an economic incentive. If you do this, you, on the other hand, take away the possibility of deciding locally how to reduce the emissions from the diet in the public kitchens, and I do not think that is necessarily appropriate. In other words, the aim is to reduce climate emissions; the aim is not that beef should not be specifically served. And by banning certain animals, I do not think that the focus is on what is essential, namely climate reductions. Therefore, we would rather adopt some other measures that have a similar effect than going in and making a definite ban here. By the way, I don't see how much time I have left. It's a little annoying. If you can get it on my screen, it'll be nice. Thank you. President There are two minutes left.) Great. I don't know why it went out. Anyway, I heard sir. Torsten Gejl's speech in a party leader's round not so long ago, which was about animal ethics, and I thought that was quite refreshing, because I also think it is important that we discuss animal ethics in here. I would like to try to play a little bit of a part in this and try to raise it here in connection with this debate. Because I think that this proposal can in fact be a little problematic in an expensive ethical perspective. For me, one of the worst things you can do is to eat more chicken in an expensive ethical perspective, for example. Well, it takes many more individuals to deliver the same amount of meat because the animals are so small. And the production conditions for such things as turbochickens are also very, very violent. I would rather serve plant-based 4 days in a week and then beef on the fifth day than serve chicken every day, if you can put it that way, wouldn't you? And by specifically banning beef being served, I also fear that something more will be focused on the smaller animals, and I think it would be better for us to try to ensure that more plant-based food is generally served. So this is my approach to this, and I hope that we can also jointly take some of the many good recommendations that have been made by the Climate Council and some of the many other proposals in this area, which is also SF's policy, and try to work together for this. But I thank the alternative for raising the debate and I think it is important. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170937	I don't know if there's anything we can do about it, but otherwise we're gonna have to help each other the best way to get through it. I would like to make a brief comment on Mr Seligman's report. Torsten Gejl. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421170945	Thanks for the speech. I don't think the SF tends to be pale to ban things, and I think this is one of the worst things in our time, that is, it plays a role in relation to climate, environment, nature, animal welfare etc. etc. But what I don't quite understand is the fact that SF would like to make some sort of grip that makes these public kitchens actually impossible by serving meat, lamb and beef so I understood it, so that you can do it in other ways. But if the result is the same, why not go in and do it, solve it, get it the most CO2 If that's the plan anyway, why don't we just solve it and do it like this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171034	Sir. Carl Valentin, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171035	There are several aspects to it. I mean, for me, it's a deal. on strategy, because I believe that the reluctance to do this will be extremely great in relation to, for example, a proposal to reduce quite significantly the climate emissions, which will result in some of the same. But it will not result in precise implementation of SF's policy on this, for example. serve plant-based food 4 days a week and then maybe beef 1 day a week. Or maybe you could serve beef 1 day a month. You will still be able to do so, but you will not ban meat from certain animals on the plate. It is also intended to ensure that climate emissions are generally reduced, and this will have some of the same effect. So I just think it's a smarter approach. In other words, I think that this is a better way of making policy, which achieves the same in terms of climate change, and which may even be better than the alternative's proposal from an expensive ethical point of view.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171129	Now I see that the clock is back in order. Here you go, sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171134	When it comes to the animal ethical perspective, the rapporteur cannot just assume that if we phase out lamb and beef as quietly as we do it can be over a period of 3, 4, 5 years then we just replace it with chicken or something else. Well, it might well be that it gave us the opportunity to train kitchen staff to replace it with plant-based food. So just to assume that there will be a lot of chicken, I think a little is making a strawman on me, because the rapporteur knows that I would never dream of thinking that. So let us make an amendment to replace it with plant-based food. Will the rapporteur vote in favour of this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171213	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171215	If you are now serving beef, for example. In a public kitchen, you use up your climate quota very quickly, so if we make some legislation that forces the kitchens to cook more plant-based food and reduce their emissions. So if they now serve beef once a week, they use up their quota, and then they have to serve plant-based food for the rest of the time. And it's for me to look better than just serving a lot of chicken. Now it's gonna be a little nerdy, and now my speaking time is up.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171245	Thank you for that, and thank you to Mr. Simpson. Carl Valentin. There are no further brief comments, and that means that we will move on to Mr Van der Klaauw's report. Søren Egge Rasmussen, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171302	We have just had a similar debate on what is to be served in public canteens, and this is then a proposal to prohibit beef and lamb from being served in public canteens and to phase it out by 2023 at the latest. I do not know whether the proposers think that in these municipalities, for example. In the western part of Jutland, where you have got to make nature care, it is something that must not end up in the public canteens. It could be something you might have had a tradition for. I would say, as with the last proposal, that I think there are a lot of municipalities and regions that are well in the process of a change of diet, and what we see in the municipality of Aarhus and in the municipality of Copenhagen, where it will be a sport to switch to ecology and reduce food waste and use the raw materials of the season and get the budget to hang together using less meat, is something that is driven by such a quiet and quiet development, and in some places you increase the ecological percentage several times, so you get up to maybe over 90 per cent. ecology in public kitchens. This then means that you have much less meat in that food and that there are committed employees around it, and I think that is very good. As with the last proposal, I think we have to ask: are there not limits to the detailed planning of parliamentary affairs? Yes, apparently there is not when we have such a proposal as today. I think it is very good that the city councils are making decisions about CO2 I think this should be anchored in the municipalities. Then we are about to increase some CO2 2 The project that came yesterday from the government will also impose on agriculture some CO2 We hope in the Enhedslisten that you end up at a higher level than the one that has been played out. We have come to have climate advice, which is clear recommendations that we need more proteins from peas and beans and other legumes and eat less meat, and that would thus lead to better public health, and I really think that the voluntary approach is a very good one to take. At times, extra money will have to be spent, and that is where we have set aside funds in the Finance Act, among other things. I think that there is a reason to allocate even more money to it, and that is something we can afford. If that's how society saves 12 billion. kr. a year, if we change our diet, then we can afford to spend a few million kroner on in-service kitchen staff. Then we have also concluded an agricultural agreement which allocates more than 1 billion. kr. to promote plant-based cultivation and plant-based products, and it is thus a larger amount that will have an impact on what it is, even the mass caterers can buy when preparing their food planning. I believe that local involvement in town councils and in the individual kitchens is very important, and I believe that we must win on the good taste and not on a lot of different bans. This is a proposal to ban beef and sheepmeat. I think that much less meat should be used in public meals, but the way to ban is not the focus of the Enhedslisten, which is why we support the intentions of the proposal, but not the concrete proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171723	Sir. Torsten Gejl, the alternative, a brief remark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171726	Well, I can hear all the words and all the intentions, but I'm struggling with how to get Enhedslisten to help reduce meat consumption in Denmark. For some strange reason we will not vote for a reduction in meat production in the Agriculture Agreement, and when we come and in a very simple way will phase out the little bit of beef and lamb in the canteens of the state, in exchange for a huge CO2, we are talking about such small steps. Does the rapporteur understand that we are on the verge of a climate disaster, and if it were the case that the voluntary way worked, would this have been resolved long ago?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171818	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171819	I understand perfectly well that we are in the midst of a climate disaster and I think it is very important how we proceed, but I do not always believe that the way to ban resolutions in the Folketing is the right way to go there. I think that the processes that are in the municipalities, the support that is locally available to recycle the diet, are extremely important, and I therefore do not think that this is the way forward specifically to turn the beef into the great sinner and to ban it. Then it would end with eating other meat, and I don't think we should go to that. So I do not think this is the best proposal I have ever seen. And with regard to the agricultural agreement, the Social Democrats will make a very broad agreement, which made it a little difficult for the parliamentary basis to maintain that we should have an objective of reducing animal production.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171920	Sir. Torsten Gejl.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171922	I do not understand why Enhedslisten was in a very, very broad agreement that did not cut meat production. The Enhedslisten must explain that himself. But rabbit meat, is the rapporteur saying that if it is the case that we phase out beef and lamb, are we going to start eating rabbit meat? The rapporteur must be able to explain this quickly. This will, of course, be by far the fastest way to do something about what the rapporteur recognises to be a climate disaster. We could do it right away, why not act?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171955	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421171957	We got a lot of good things through in the Agriculture Agreement, among other things. a target of 6-8 million. t CO2 reductions. That is what we negotiated at the time when the alternative had left the negotiations, and that was, in fact, the facts. The alternative left the negotiations before it became serious, but there was Enhedslisten and other parties thus helping to push through some things, among others. This billion to develop on the plant-based diet. So we got fingerprints on that agricultural agreement. Could it have been better? Yes, it could.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172027	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief remarks, and that means that we are moving forward, and that is now Mr. Per Larsen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172038	Thank you for that, Mr President, and thank you for that. Torsten Gejl to put forward this proposal which highlights a number of issues which I will discuss in more detail. But I can tell you that it will not be a proposal that we will support. There is, in fact, a good summary in the proposal where Mr. Torsten Gejl explains why the two groups of animal meat that this concerns, namely lamb and beef, must be phased out and abolished, and that is because they are ruminants. It is also explained that the climate gas we are talking about here is methane in large quantities, and it is quite shady in relation to climate footprints. However, technology has actually been developed to detect the methane emitted, and as recently as yesterday at yesterday's meeting of the Committee on the Environment and Food, we were presented with how such installations can capture the methane emitted and simply use it for burning in generators which can then supply the buildings with electricity. So the methane is removed by the rapid removal of the manure and then electricity from the methane is made. It's a win-win situation, and then you've solved the methane emissions, and you get some good electricity for the property. It was a solution in which we think there is some perspective. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172216	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief remarks, and that means that we are moving forward, and that is now Mr. Søren Espersen, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172224	It will in many ways be a kind of repetition of what we have just been through in relation to the resolution before this. Our arguments will largely be the same, which is why I do not have to make so much of it, but I just want to say that in the Danish People's Party we do not think it is Parliament's job to decide whether the Danes can eat beef and lamb. We believe that the Danes themselves are able to decide how climate conscious you want to live. As the rules are today, canteens have ample opportunity to offer a wide range of more or less climate friendly menus to their customers. Directly forbidding a food being served is one, we think, Udansk thought. We also have a responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, to safeguard the Danish food culture, which among other things. is made up of beef and lamb, and it would be wrong to prohibit canteen serving just that. If the individual Dane wants to eat foods with a lower climate impression, there is now ample opportunity to supply itself in various vegetarian and vegan offers, which many canteens already offer today. We therefore believe that it must be up to the individual to decide what to eat and, if there is no beef and lamb market in the future, it will naturally be phased out in the supply of public canteens. So the Danish People's Party is also voting against this proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172350	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. Then we have come to Mrs Susanne Zimmer, Free Green.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172407	Thank you to the alternative for putting forward a proposal that goes in the right direction, but it is not today that trees grow into the sky. I say that it is going in the right direction, because we know that lamb and beef are one of the most strained meats, and it will clearly help to get it out of the public canteen. However, in relation to the previous proposal put forward by the Free Greens, we do not think it is ambitious enough, because more is needed. However, I would like to enter into negotiations in committee and see if we can jointly achieve something that can meet our ambition level. So I cannot at this stage take a position on what we are going to vote on the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172500	Thank you. There are no brief comments. Then we have come to the rapporteur for the authors of the motion, Mr President. Torsten Gejl, the alternative.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421172525	Thank you, President. In 2019 beef and lamb amounted to 3%. of Copenhagen Municipality's food supply • only 3%. Yet these two types of meat accounted for 45%. of the total CO2 This means that a phasing out of lamb and beef from the public kitchens is an unimaginably low-hanging fruit. It is an opportunity to save incredibly much CO 2 So imagine that the government, SF and Enhedslisten today choose to miss the opportunity of a very large CO 2 SF was out supporting the government's proposal in October 2020 to introduce two meat-free days into the state canteens. At that time the government withdrew its proposal because parts of the trade union movement were against it. However, when the SF was out to support the proposal at the time, why not support a proposal that is less comprehensive and more targeted today? I really think the support parties are putting the brakes in there when it comes to saving CO2 It happens at the same time that the UN Climate Panel begs us to speed up because we have to crack the curve for CO2 As far as I understand on the Enhedslisten, was part of their reason that we have to wait for CO2 So, yesterday came the game to CO2 per. tonnes, despite the fact that the Climate Council has recommended double that. Eventually, Denmark's great CO2 was given a CO2 so now the Enhedslisten will say no to this obvious huge CO2 2 To the government I would say that in the alternative, we are pleased that new dietary councils have been introduced to encourage the Danes to reduce their intake of meat. As the Minister says, as far as I understood, we can reduce CO2 by eating plant based. But why do the state's own cafeteria not comply with the state's own dietary council? Red meat is still being served in the public canteen. This means that responsibility for the green transition is being pushed on even more to the citizens. Well, I agree that we don't decide what the Danes eat in private homes, it's up to people themselves, but it's not the State's job to feed the Danes with red steaks that have a CO2 That's why I think you should support this proposal that creates a huge CO2 So, all in all, I get discouraged that just some of the people in this country who could do something radical in terms of limiting CO2 2 I would like to remind you that the scientific reports from among others. The UN says that the climate situation is worse than initially thought. We have to do more than we thought we should do first. We are, for example. in writing. - (DE) In this situation, I think that the government's support parties are allowing totally obvious opportunities to save CO2 and I find that deeply disappointing. Finally, of course, I would like to thank the Free Greens for being ready to try to negotiate how we could meet on a type of proposal such as this in a committee procedure, but I have to say that there is not much support for the proposal, so unfortunately this will not be a reality. Thank you, President.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173011	Thank you. First of all, there is a brief comment from Mr. Carl Valentin, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173015	I just think it is important for me to say that I am quite happy that the alternative has put forward this proposal, because I think it raises an important debate, and we would really like to do so. We just think it's some other handles we should turn on. I mean, it's about the fact that if you introduce a high meat tax, it's gonna hit beef and lamb really hard. If binding climate targets are set in public kitchens to reduce their emissions, then they will also drastically reduce the consumption of beef and lamb. It is about offering plant-based food in all public kitchens. So we have plenty of other solutions, even if we do not think that exactly the model presented here by the Alternative is the right one. So let's try jointly to pressure the government and the rest of the Folketing on this, because I kind of agree that you could go a lot further in here to ensure that we get more plant-based food served in the public kitchens of this country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173112	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173113	It's the same place we want to land. So, as far as I understand, SF has tools they want to use to ensure that we don't have beef and lamb left in the state canteens, like that. That's where we're gonna end up. We could then work together in the name of the climate and say that we are in favour of the SF's proposal and the SF is in favour of our proposal because we want the same place. And there I just sometimes lack consensus; that, instead of it being absolutely one party's proposal or the other party's proposal, we make sure that it is done and sings in chorus. Because that's all the government can understand.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173152	Sir. Carl Valentin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173200	Well, that wouldn't be done by the SF specifically supporting this proposal. I mean, there is no majority in favour of it at all. That is why I think it makes sense for us in the SF to say what is our policy and what we are going to do. And I believe that our policy will be at least as effective if not more effective than this, but much more feasible and much more strategically wise to fight for, because I believe that it will create less resistance. I am not trying to talk down the alternative's work or proposals. I think that we are doing a good job and I think that we are raising an important debate. But we must also consider that we are dealing with some legislation, and that is why we are trying to support what we think is the right way to go, and that is where we have some rather different solutions from those put forward by the alternative here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173244	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173246	Well, all SF's tools and all their policies don't go through either. I can say exactly the same to the SF. After all, none of our policies do. That's why we don't have to suck it up like this. It's about supporting each other's good suggestions... and then we're two, and maybe we'll be three, and maybe we'll be four. But it's always such a piece of talk about us wanting the same thing, but we don't want to support each other, because we want to do it in a tiny bit different ways. And while the Earth is warming up, we are on our way to some conditions that will probably make us wish that we had collaborated more.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173323	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Susanne Zimmer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173326	Thank you and thank the rapporteur for the proposal and for the speech. If we take the SF's proposal for a climate target, I do not see that one excludes the other. But would the rapporteur think that a level of ambition with a 25% reduction in 2025 was satisfactory?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173353	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173354	Well, this is the food strategy that we have implemented in Copenhagen ourselves, which our cultural mayor has carried out in Copenhagen for the municipal food schemes, but we always raise the bar. We do what we can, and then we raise the bar, and then we want to move on. We have succeeded now, but it is not enough; we must move on. The UN keeps saying that the climate is deteriorating faster than we thought.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173426	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173428	Well, exactly, things are evolving. I assume that the climate objective in the City of Copenhagen is a few years old or more, and since then it has come in with reports that show that this is so urgent, so the more things need to be done now. However, many of the other rapporteurs say that there is a problem with putting some demands on the public kitchens, such as: not serving meat or red meat. Is the rapporteur afraid that this could backfire? In other words, will people not think that if there are any good alternatives, that is fine, or what does the rapporteur think about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173511	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173511-2	I believe that the politicians who stand here and say that we should not use bans are themselves using bans in a wide range of areas. I don't understand why we can't do this. I think it's gonna be a scam. I cannot imagine any better place to phase out anything and apply bans than when it comes to reducing climate problems, natural problems, environmental problems, animal welfare problems and health problems.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173536	Thank you. Then no one else has asked for the floor. The debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on the Environment and Food and, if no one objects, I consider it adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173552	The debate is open, and this is the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421173619	First of all, many thanks to the Members of Parliament who tabled this motion for a resolution. The opportunity to discuss Danish farmland and what we do to engage more people in the agriculture we have is something that is extremely relevant. Far down the road, too, we on the part of the government agree with the issues raised by the resolution and with the intentions contained in the proposal. I am, for example. agree that Danish agriculture must adapt in a green and climate-friendly direction. I also agree that we are facing a generation challenge in which Danish agriculture must be able to appeal to new generations of climate-conscious and entrepreneurial young people. At the same time, I agree that there should be room for smaller herds. Finally, I agree with the perspective of new forms of ownership in agriculture. It's very exciting, it's very relevant. I and the government also have great sympathy for several of the issues mentioned in the proposal, but I do not believe that the proposal offers the right solutions. There are two reasons for this. One reason is that the government basically does not consider it appropriate for the State to purchase all agricultural land through a general option to buy. Such a general right of option would constitute a restriction on the right of farmers to dispose of their own property. It is intrusive and it cannot be ruled out that it will raise some difficult legal issues that we need to be able to resolve. The second reason is that I am sceptical about the economic volume of the proposal. To set aside a total of 90 billion. kr. until 2030 to buy up land will take up a disproportionate share of government finances. I am simply thinking, it is unrealistic, it is too large a amount, it is too violent. The Government therefore proposes that the proposal be rejected. Although I do not think the proposal provides the right solution, I would like to stress that the issues raised by the proposal and the intentions contained in the proposal are interesting. So thank you for that. In this context, let me mention that the government is in the process of taking initiatives in several of the areas addressed by the proposal. Firstly, the proposal envisages a green conversion of Danish agriculture. This is where the government is in full swing. A few months ago, Denmark has had the world's most ambitious green agricultural agreement, which strengthens the climate, biodiversity and the environment. This applies, among other things, to: a set-aside of low-level areas and a doubling of ecology and a great deal of effort on plant-based foods, as well as a massive nitrogen effort, just to mention some of the many examples from this Agriculture Agreement. Secondly, the proposal proposes that it should be easier for young people to establish themselves in agriculture. It is also a good, a sympathetic and a very relevant thought. I am also very much concerned about this. In a situation where agriculture is facing an ambitious green transition, it is essential that agriculture also has the capacity to appeal to a new, young and adaptable and climate-conscious generation, which does not necessarily have a high level of equity. That is why it is important to me that we ensure good opportunities for young entrepreneurial and visionary farmers to establish themselves as farmers. We are creating better conditions for this through the historically broad agricultural agreement of October last year. In fact, we set aside 964 million. kr. to a scheme for setting up young farmers. From 2023, young farmers can get an important capital injection of up to DKK 745,000. to create liquidity and equity when they establish themselves for the first time. This is an important step, however. With the Agriculture Agreement, we also re-prioritize 150 million. kr. from Danish Agricultural Capital to a new Green Agricultural Capital. The idea is that funds should support generational change, which should contribute to green innovation in the agricultural sector while ensuring financial soundness on farms, too, a step in the right direction. At the same time, the so-called small-scale package, which stems from the current food reconciliation, focuses on supporting small local businesses. These can help to develop completely new forms of production and products. We focus on increased help and guidance for business start-ups and on removing unnecessary obstacles and barriers. So when it comes to green transition and the generational challenge, the government has a strong focus on the very things that are also addressed here in the proposal. Having said that, it makes a great deal of sense to think further in relation to the further issues raised by the motion for a resolution. This applies both to the growing concentration of land ownership and to the need for new forms of ownership in agriculture. Let me start with the first. In agriculture there has been a strong tendency for many years to increase farms. From 1990 to 2020, the average holding area increased from 56 hectares per year. holding in 1990 to 211 hectares per year; holding in 2020. This development has also had the consequence that there have been significantly fewer farms in Denmark. In 1990 there were approx. 35,000 full-time holdings, and by 2020 that figure had fallen to approx. 8,500 full-time holdings. It's quite a fall anyway. There have therefore been considerably fewer farms and they have become considerably larger. We have thus seen that ownership of agricultural land and farms has been accumulated in ever fewer hands, or as my good party colleague Mr. Bjarne Laustsen said at the group meeting this morning: It is now the case in many cities that there are only three farms left. There are the manor, there is the poor farm, and there is the cemetery. That was, of course, humorous, but it is a very good picture of where we are with ever fewer crews. This is a development that we need to be aware of. The green transition is without comparison the biggest challenge that Danish agriculture has faced for decades. We must therefore ensure a framework and a development that does not hamper the green conversion of agriculture. The fact is that large and smaller farms can do something differently, and perhaps they can also play a different role in the green transition. Large farms allow economic economies of scale. Each farmer can produce more efficiently. At the same time, small farms offer better opportunities to establish more niche production. New experimental forms of production can also involve small local food companies and the sale of food on local markets. Both will be needed in the green transition, I am absolutely sure. That is why it is important for me and for the government that there should be room for more types of holdings, and we must create a framework for that politically. We're gonna play more horses. Finally, there are the new forms of ownership in the agricultural sector. Interesting things are happening here. Let me mention, for example, cooperative farms. The aim here is for Members who want a green farm to pay quotas. For the quotas, cooperative farms and farms are bought around the country, which are leased by young climate- and ecology-oriented farmers. Very exciting and positive. Something that can engage people, something that can involve people. Very good. That development is visionary and furiously interesting because it does three things at the same time: it challenges the trend of growing concentration of agricultural land on fewer hands. It opens up agriculture to a new and young and entrepreneurial generation, and it pushes for a green conversion of agriculture. That is why, in my opinion, we politicians should go into the think box and consider whether there is even more we can do to support the fact that there is room for other ways of farming in the future too. That's an exciting thought. This is an exciting opportunity. It's something that can be committed. I would like once again to thank the Members of Parliament who tabled this motion for a resolution. It's thought-provoking. That's interesting. There are also elements of vision in what can inspire, but I still think it goes too far. The government will therefore reject the proposal for the reasons I have mentioned. Instead, we will look into how we can help to achieve the good intentions of the proposal, because there are good intentions in it by God. These are just some other methods to use than a total state takeover and spend so much money on something that, in my opinion, can also be at the edge of the inviolability of ownership. So thank you for the floor. I look forward to the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174619	Thank you. Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174622	Thank you. And thank you to the Minister for the speech. It is true that there are many good initiatives under way, but right now we are in the situation that over the next five years there are expected to be 3 000 changes of ownership or generations and, as the Minister says, is the very large agriculture we have, so who can afford to buy that land? Right now we're up to that 2.5%. of our land is actually owned by foreign companies or owners, and that development can be feared to continue. So how will the Minister, in the real world, with the large sums of money it costs to take over a property, ensure that we get in the direction that the Minister himself has mentioned, with less land and with another form of cultivation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174714	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174716	Thank you very much to Mrs Susanne Zimmer for this relevant question. Well, we are in a situation where relatively few Danes own very large areas of our farmland. So there is a great deal of concentration here, and when there is a change of generation, it is also a very large amount of money that you have to get rid of in order to take over. And this is a challenge we need to look at. I now mentioned some of the initiatives already included in the Agriculture Agreement in order to ensure that younger farmers can get on the ground. In the past, initiatives have been taken to ensure that capital funds and others can go in and make economies of scale, which also makes it possible to speed up in relation to the green transition. But finally, there are these opportunities to think differently and new. There I mentioned my speech co-operatives, which I think is an element that is exciting. I have also seen that some organic farmers work to share equipment. There are, among other things: This phenomenon of milk sharing, where milking equipment is shared, to help younger farmers get started without having to get rid of so much capital. There's a lot of interesting thinking, and we're gonna have to put on turbos.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174822	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174823	Yes, there are a lot of good ideas, but it is really small-scale, so when we talk about these many generations that need to be, it can't happen by taking over from co-operative farms, and young farmers can't buy those farms. However, something else is also the removal of low-level soils and the securing of our drinking water in well-stocked protection areas. It's not working out. What are we doing about it, in other words, to ensure that we continue to have clean drinking water, that we continue to have good soil, which can also be run by the next generations?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174857	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174859	After all, we have made a very broad agreement on agriculture, which we were pleased to see that virtually all the parties in the Danish Parliament at Christiansborg supported. I know the Greens weren't in it. However, there are a number of initiatives that make it economically attractive for pilots, for farmers to take out low bottom soil and flood it and thus encapsulate CO2 We are happy to look at whether there are even more things we can do that way around. And otherwise we're working on how to develop these new forms of ownership. So there are many interesting things we need to put turbo on, and we are happy to discuss that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174939	Thank you. There are no more comments to the Minister, so we are starting with the rapporteur's series. Sir. Brian Bressendorff, Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421174949	Thank you for the floor. First of all, I would like to thank the authors of this proposal for the creation of a state farm fund. In the Social Democratic Party we are very much in agreement with the issues that the resolution seeks to resolve. At the same time, we also share the intention that Danish agriculture should be converted in a green and climate-friendly direction. There is no doubt that we are in a situation where Danish agriculture does not sufficiently appeal to the new generations of more climate-conscious and entrepreneurial young people. We also agree that there are good democratic prospects in increasing opportunities to spread ownership to the land, so that in future there will be better room for smaller herds and new forms of ownership in agriculture. We have great sympathy for the issues raised by the proposal. Nevertheless, we do not entirely believe in the solution proposed by the proposal. There are two main reasons for this. One is that we do not think it appropriate for the State to buy all agricultural land through such a general option. This will restrict the right of farmers to dispose of their property. Then it is also because, as is stated here, the proposal will take up a very large part of the state's finances. It will cost around 90 billion. kr. until 2030 to buy up land of that magnitude. However, despite the fact that we do not believe that the proposal provides the right solution, I would like to stress that I think that the proposal addresses some rather important issues, and I can assure you that the Social Democracy has focused on both the green transition and the generational challenge in agriculture. Fortunately, we are in full swing through other tracks. A few months ago, we concluded what is perhaps the world's most ambitious green agricultural agreement with a large broad majority, which strengthens the climate, biodiversity and the environment. Here, among other things, there were: This appropriation is intended to cover commitments remaining to be settled from the 2000-2006 programming period. kr. I think it would be a good idea if we were to set up a system of setting up to make it easier for these young, entrepreneurial, visionary farmers to set themselves up. For there is no doubt that it is a very important prerequisite that agriculture can appeal to a new, young, ready-to-change and climate-conscious generation. This is crucial if we are to succeed in such an ambitious green conversion of agriculture. Having said that, it makes a great deal of sense for us to think further in relation to the problem of increasing the concentration of land ownership and the need for new forms of ownership in agriculture. This is a development that we need to be aware of and therefore also some rather important issues that we would very much like to discuss further. To sum up, the Social Democratic Party will reject the proposal on the basis that I have already mentioned, because we do not think the proposal provides the right solution, and that is so, despite the fact that we believe that some important discussions are being raised in what we would like to discuss in the future. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175304	Thank you. Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175306	Thank you and thank the rapporteur. The rapporteur mentions that there may be a problem in granting the option of buying up land to the State, but there is, of course, in the proposal that it should be the market prices that are, so what does it matter to the farmer whether he sells to a state fund which subsequently leases the land out, or sells to another farmer or some big company that buys the land and joins it with other farms? What does that mean for that farmer? What does he lose or she lose?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175348	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175351	That is exactly what the legislation already contains. This is a general buy-in right, which will just eliminate some of the market that will be for these properties and these lands. So I really think it is quite different from what the rapporteur is saying here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175413	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175415	Does the rapporteur agree with me that land prices have escalated dramatically and that this is one of the reasons why it is actually really difficult for farmers to make surpluses on their farms?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175428	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175429	I agree that land prices have risen sharply.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175438	Thank you. There are no more comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Erling Bonnesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175454	Thank you. In the Left, we are not in favour of the state buying up land for many, many billions of dollars, which, incidentally, we can read out in the proposal is completely unfunded. The proposal is a frontal attack on the industry and also an attack on the current development of the entire agricultural and food sector. We think that's bad. It will then also have very major consequences for rural areas and our economy. I can also hear from the debate that has been going on so far that it may even be at the edge of the rules we have for private property, etc. I shall not go further into that now, but it is certainly a concern that I can hear there. It will also have major consequences for rural communities. We simply cannot have that. In the Left, we are in favour of the free market and do not believe that anyone here in Christiansborg should begin to conceive of the idea that they can drive agriculture and the land better than those who already own and run the land and who put a lot of effort into it. Having such a great desire for control as we see in the proposal here is, in fact, almost directly frightening to such a liberal Liberal Liberal like me. Against this background, we in the Left are voting against the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175615	Thank you. Then it is Mrs Susanne Zimmer who has just made a brief comment. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175619	Thank you. Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. The rapporteur says that this could cause problems in rural areas, but it is precisely in this that we need less farms and more people in rural areas. Then it doesn't help create life in the countryside instead of the three farms now I don't remember what it was, cemeteries etc.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175646	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175647	Well, as a Liberal Liberal, I have a clear position that there should be room for both large and small farms, because that makes it possible to achieve that great variety of agricultural and food production, of which we are also very proud in Denmark. So what will also strengthen rural areas in Denmark is the freedom to put together its own farms, both large and small. And we can see around that there are also many niche productions, farm shops, regional specialities and different sizes of farms, so there must certainly be room for both large and small.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175723	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175725	Thank you. It is true that there are many small farm sales, and often it can only generate profits for the one who lives on the farm. But the fact that land prices have risen so much makes it very difficult to be a farmer now, and the freedom you really should have, of course, very many do not have. Freedom is actually in the credit union. So, does the rapporteur not see that there could be an advantage in having this bought up and then having prices lowered so that we find a proper place for land prices?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175807	Thank you, and here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175808	As I have already indicated in my rapporteur's speech, we are totally opposed to the approach to what is being proposed here. That is where we think we should go quite different ways to ensure, one might say, better development opportunities for the agricultural and food sectors. There you can look at the general framework conditions on another occasion. But the proposal here would actually tear away the carpet during the industry instead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175835	Thank you. There are no more comments. Then it's mr. Rasmus Nordqvist, Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421175843	Thank you for the floor. We are dealing here with a matter which in many ways actually points to a lot of real problems: how do we do something about the big task of generational change in Danish agriculture? How do we do something about taking out low-level soils? How do we ensure clean drinking water, that is, our groundwater? And how do you support many more and new ownership forms?We can't support this proposal, because we don't think it's the right answer to the challenges of creating one big central fund that will then buy all land and start being a tenant. We are, in effect, pleased with many of the measures we have taken. In relation to low-level land outlets, where it has previously gone very slowly, new things have been started now, which actually show that it has begun to go faster. After all, we decided precisely to set up this group, which is examining how we can put even more turbo on the good results that have been achieved lately. We have just adopted a rather significant drinking water fund with the 2022 Finance Act to ensure our drinking water, etc. So I think we do a lot of these things. The challenge that I think would actually be interesting to discuss is this with new forms of ownership and how we support it. The proposal points to cooperative farms, etc., and the Minister also mentioned this. There is something there that I really think could be interesting if we in the committee could start to examine how we can support new forms of ownership in agriculture instead of thinking that it should be a state fund that should then start owning the land. So we reject this proposal, but we really hope that it will give rise to a committee discussion of ownership forms so that we can find out how we can support this shift in agriculture. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180040	There are a few brief comments. Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180046	I am surprised that the SF is rejecting this resolution, because if you look at what SF has meant over time, you were looking at a large report back in 2001, suggesting that you should prepare for a state farm fund, and when you look at what it is based on, you will see that it refers back to proposals from the SF from 1980, 1983, 1988 and 1993, and then you have the proposal that led to a preparatory work. Then, unfortunately, it happened that Anders Fogh became prime minister, and then it was not used, and then we are here today discussing a state farm fund. So I can't quite understand why SF is now against it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180141	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180142	Well, it's kind of because we're doing a lot of things, and you're gonna have to dump all that because you're gonna have to set up a new central fund now? Fortunately, things have evolved since 1980, 1983 and 1988, and we have, in fact, moved on. In fact, I think that the work we have done with Enhedslisten, about a drinking water fund, is worth being both proud of and happy about, in other words, that we have been given money to go in and support municipalities and water plants in how they get land taken out or they get afforestation etc. In these areas. To start wanting to put 90 billion. kr. of up to 2030 to create a central government fund to own this land, I don't think that's the answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180222	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180224	It can be done in different ways. It may also be a model that Enhedslisten has previously proposed, just as you have the Danish Green Investment Fund. You can do something where you don't have a very close government management of it all. But with everything we need to convert to more forest, take out so many of the low bottom areas, I think there is a need for more instruments. I have noted that there are good smaller initiatives, yes, that is when you have an ecological agricultural fund that may have invested in 100 hectares, because then there will have to be a lot of such things to achieve, and that is why I think there should also be a state farm fund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180304	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180305	In the agricultural negotiations we had, we were very open to discussing the solutions that Enhedslisten offered, but I do not recognise that this should be Enhedslisten's proposal, that we make this fund with the money in it. But it may be that the rapporteur can make us wiser when he comes to the platform. In fact, when I wrinkled at the fact that the questioner was talking about minor measures, it is because I think that the drinking water fund that we managed to create with Finance Law 2022 is a very important tool and not a small tool in ensuring clean drinking water in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180339	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Susanne Zimmer. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180342	Thank you and thank the rapporteur for the speech. In other words, the rapporteur is very much involved in saying that it is good to look at new forms of ownership, but could the agricultural fund just not make it easy? Because what's happening right now is petty. I also think I hear the rapporteur say that leasing is not a good way to do it, that is to say that it will be state-owned, but it will have to be rented out in smaller lots with some criteria on how it is to be cultivated.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180413	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180414	But I just think that what I am saying very clearly is: how can we support new forms of ownership? I'm not saying that things are going well as they are now. I say that there is a problem there which we must examine and which I actually hope we can enter into the work of the committee. Then it is right that it is the state that must own it in order to lease it out, but the solution that you come up with here in this proposal seems to me to have so many weaknesses in relation to the challenges we face today and the solutions we have made in recent years that I cannot see the reasoning in it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180449	Thank you. There are no more comments. Then it's Mrs. Zenia Stampe, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180507	Thank you. This proposal is all good intentions. And if we were in 2001, I might not have been as dismissive as I am today. I think I would have a certain scepticism about going in and buying up so much land and renting it, that is, almost nationalising so much of our land. But by that time it would probably have been very favorable if we had looked at our land and taken a position on how it had been most appropriately used. Instead, 20 years have passed, when agriculture has been centralised. The Minister for Food himself mentioned the many acquisitions that have taken place and how many fewer hands and owners are actually in agriculture and how difficult it is for new farmers to enter the market, so to speak. Twenty years ago, perhaps we could have done more to ensure better land use in terms of protecting the environment, climate, biodiversity. So I can really understand the idea of seeing it all in a wider perspective and planning how we use our land. But I must also say that right now, right now, when we have so I am afraid that it would significantly delay that process if we had suddenly to think it through completely in the context of a lot of other issues. Having said that, there is no doubt that it makes sense to cross some of these issues. I sometimes wish that we had just one place where we did it, one place where we looked at all these considerations at once, rather than that it is in a hundred seventeen different aid schemes. I just don't believe that we would find a more effective and faster solution by throwing it all up in the air and then putting it all into a new big, huge fund, where I am sure it would take a few years before we could get off with it properly. That is why we are voting against the proposal. We also have the criticism which is recurring in relation to many of the resolutions we are discussing here in Parliament, namely that we should also like to look at where the money comes from. And compared to 30 billion. kr. kr. And I think that is a tiny bit irresponsible, frankly, when you sit and negotiate money for the Finance Act once a year, that it is not there that you make that demand. We actually came up with a demand and for more money for the removal of low-level soils one year, where I think Enhedslisten made a demand, I don't remember whether it was nurses, educators or teachers, and it was also very sensible. But that is also where we have to bring in those priorities instead of thinking that, with a fingertips, we can find them when dealing with a motion for a resolution in which we have not even taken the trouble to indicate where the money is to come from. I just don't think this is a serious approach to a crazy big and important problem that requires concrete and, above all, rapid solutions.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180929	Thank you. Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421180931	After all, it is not the Enhedslisten who has tabled this motion for a resolution, but we really do not have to go back more than 5-6 years, when we had our own motion for a resolution to create a state farm fund. And we really need a lot of tools. We also have a Climate Forest Fund - it does not do everything alone; it has a limited number of millions to start investments with. We have been set in motion by means of financial laws, which could end up with green bonds, which could of course be something that provided funding for something like this 10 million. kr. in the last Finance Act, in preparation for something to create more afforestation. So, yes, we have something in process, but it is not something that means that we should not do any more. So I would like to appeal to us to be open to that. And what will the rapporteur do on the day when suddenly Chinese or Russian capital is invested in Danish agricultural land? What will be done at that time? What's the countermove to that? Could it be a government land-use fund?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181032	Thank you. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181033	I would like to start by making an apology: I actually thought that the resolution came from the Enhedslisten, because Enhedslisten has argued so diligently for this when we have sat together and discussed agriculture. But I understand that it has been put forward by the Greens. That also explains it a little better, that is to say it comes from the Free Greens, who are not in the financial law negotiations. So I'm sorry. I am well aware of Enhedslisten's preference for this solution, but it is not the Enhedslisten who has brought it forward today and thus put a resolution to 90 billion. kr. in the Parliamentary Chamber without a bid for funding. And that, in the end, is what it stands and falls with. It is a lack of funding, but it is also that it will take a process that we are quite busy with and in which we are doing a lot of different things that unfortunately run in different tracks and are not always coordinated. But sometimes, unfortunately, coordination is also what takes extra time, and we are very busy not least when it comes to the removal of low bottom soil.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181140	Sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181141	Yes, but does the rapporteur not see that if we were to accelerate some afforestation in Denmark, it could be an instrument? In other words, we already have state forests, and we also have municipal forests in some places, and if we are to give priority to this, it is probably not more advanced than that we could create a state fund that buys land and that could set up forests. It could also be that agricultural land was leased out. That is not contrary to our policy. But does the rapporteur not see that this could actually be a way of accelerating some things?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181210	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181211	I can see that. We ourselves have proposed a climate fund, and we would like to see a massive investment in forests. And we will continue to fight for this; although we have already achieved results in various negotiations, we will then continue to work and fight for even more money to be set aside for land set aside, forest planting, etc. etc. What we are against is the construction, and then it is putting a motion for a resolution at 90 billion. kr. without specifying a financing.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181244	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181246	Thank you and thank the rapporteur. Now it's 90 billion. kr. over 9 years, that is now 8 years, and money comes in at the same time as you lease it out. So the amount is not really that big, but you have to know what kind of capital you have to work with as a starting point. There are probably a lot of investment companies that want to shoot in money, because right now many companies want to market themselves as green. This gives us the opportunity to draw on the development we would like to see in agriculture. So my question to the rapporteur is: is the rapporteur satisfied with the pace at which low-level land is being taken, converted into ecology and converted agriculture into more regenerative agriculture, so that we have some land that is fertile also for the next generations of farmers?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181334	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181336	No, we are certainly not satisfied with that, but we finally managed six months ago to land an agricultural agreement which would like to speed up these processes after we have been waiting for us to negotiate agriculture for one year. So the agricultural agreement was the culmination of many years, when it has not gone fast enough, but also the culmination of quite a long wait to start negotiations at all and find concrete solutions. That's where I think this is a beautiful thought, but it's also a bit of a roadside bomb compared to the work we're finally getting started and which we've got to do, I can't curse very busy getting to the finish line if we're going to solve the climate crisis. And I do not see there that such a huge nationalisation model, which has many different considerations at one and the same time, should be able to bring us to the goal faster, and we are in a hurry. In many ways it might create a more beautiful solution if we had it all together and planned it out of a hundred seventeen bottom lines at once, but we just don't have time for it right now. We're in a hurry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181448	Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181449	Yeah, that's exactly what we're in a hurry. And what is happening now does not seem to us in the Greens to be busy enough. Right now we have the problem of soil prices. In other words, does the rapporteur not think that they are too high, and is that not what can make us risk getting even more foreign investors, which means that we are losing control of our Danish country, where it is suddenly in foreign hands, as the Enhedslisten's rapporteur also mentioned? Then I would say that we have a tool in dealing with this, because some experience has been gained with multifunctional land distribution. Good experience has also been gained with this. So it's just a matter of getting started and releasing it in many parts of the country.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181533	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181534	But it is precisely multifunctional land distribution that I am thinking of when I say that, on the one hand, it would be fantastic if all considerations could be thought together, but, on the other hand, I am not sure that we have time to do quite as thoroughly as we would like. For it takes time, and very little land has been taken in connection with multifunctional land distribution, unfortunately. So I am not fully aware of the impact that it will have on prices if the state goes in ahead and says that you have to invest 70 billion. kr. in agricultural land. I guess that's hardly going to bring down prices. It would then make it even more attractive to get hold of the land that is actually being offered.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181620	Thank you. Then there's no more comments, and then it's sir. Søren Egge Rasmussen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421181633	In the Enhedslisten, we are in favour of the creation of a state land user fund. We ourselves proposed this back in 2017, and there we had a good debate on it. The details of it can then be different. In our model, we had to make it like the Danish Green Investment Fund and thereby allow for the purchase of agricultural land, and it should then be leased out on ecological principles. Since we made our proposal, the climate agenda has moved up even higher, so I see even more good reasons why you should have an extra tool in the toolbox to buy land that you think is attractive. It could be land where you would like afforestation to ensure our groundwater, it could be massive to buy low bottom land so that we could get turbo on that set-up of low bottom land, and it could be areas that you could see had some special natural values and that could make us have very large coherent natural areas in Denmark. Our proposal had so little other concept than what the Free Greens are now proposing here, because it is defined as a pre-purchase right for agricultural land, and that is something a little different. In other words, we want to see legislation in place to ensure that we have the right to buy what comes for sale. I think that there were a great many good intentions in the report that was made back in 2001, and it was certainly a pity that a bourgeois government came along instead of concluding the report and perhaps setting up a government farm fund at that time. Because there must have been a reason why SF, through a finance agreement, got in some text that then made such a dike's report on the possibilities for it. If you look at what is happening in Denmark, the agricultural law has been liberalised, so everyone can buy up farmland, you just have to have a Danish company, and there is a certain purchase of Danish farmland. To a certain extent it is Dutch people who then settle in Denmark, but it is also participating in different parts of Europe that buy it. When we went through all this with mink substitutes, it was found that there was also a Chinese who had mink farms in Denmark. We actually have legislation, so that if China really wanted to buy agricultural land in Denmark, they could do it, or Russia could do it, and I think that the Folketing will wake up on the day when massive purchases of Danish farmland start. It is a bit grotesque that we have a good cottage rule, so that an EU citizen cannot buy a holiday home in Denmark, but you can buy a coastal goods. Where is the reasonableness of that? I believe that too much has been liberalised in relation to agricultural legislation. So our basic view is that we see opportunities in having a state land user fund. It is a huge task that we face with the climate struggle, to secure our groundwater and to ensure that more forests are coming in Denmark, and it is good that there are private initiatives that have made funds, among other things. on Samsø, to buy farmland. There they have a concept that they want young farmers to move to Samsø and establish themselves, and it may be easier if you do not have to There is another initiative, Dansk Ekojord, which buys both organic and not organic land and leases it out on ecological terms. But this is perhaps 100 hectares, as is the case with the last example, and so, somewhere we need something bigger, and it might well be something that is based on last year's Finance Act that we will have a drinking water fund with some kind of funding, and we are, in fact, open to the fact that if the government provides a good financing model for it, it is being pushed forward. However, we need to do more and faster, so I am not quite mad that the Free Greens have stolen parts of our policy and made this proposal. We have some other wording in our weighting of a land user fund, but to have the debate on this is, in my view, important.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182113	Thank you. Mrs. Susanne Zimmer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182116	Thank you to the rapporteur. It's nice that it sounds like we can find a common stand here and work on it. Then the big challenge will be to get some with us, I hear. We're gonna have to take that fight. Thank you to the rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182132	Thank you. Then it's mr. Per Larsen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182142	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to Mrs Susanne Zimmer from the Free Greens for making this proposal. I do not imagine that the proposer has any illusions that we should vote in favour of this proposal. This is clearly not something that we can support in any way. We have, of course, not so long ago reached a very good agricultural agreement, broadly based in the Folketing. The Enhedslisten and all sorts of good parties have been able to see themselves in a very good agreement, which ensures a good framework for agriculture and ensures stability precisely because the agreement is so broadly based. So the proposal that the state should have granted the option to purchase agricultural land at a pre-determined price of about DKK 150,000. would be killing. The credit associations, and who else has financed agriculture, would have to tremble to such an extent, and many would certainly go to the bottom of their heads if they were going to pay their mortgage, because the prices on the land would have simply fallen. I can tell you that prices actually increased by 8.2%. in 2021, and it would have some major consequences if someone then bought right here at the top and then was about to pay off because the land prices would then fall. Nor do I see any serious funding in the proposal put forward by the Free Greens. So all in all, that is quite problematic. Then there's this indictment that the generational change is supposed to be a huge problem. I do not know where the proposers are from. It is not the case that there are large and efficient production buildings around which are not operated. I know that all the farmland around us is being driven and the production properties that are being put up for sale are being bought quite quickly and the generational shift, and I do not see that there is any problem at all in this context. It is also young farmers who set themselves up on rather large farms and if they are otherwise skilled enough, and that is a great many of them, then they can get the creditor to finance those properties, so that is certainly not something the state needs to interfere in in that way. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182425	Thank you. Mrs. Susanne Zimmer, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182427	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. Does the rapporteur not think that this is a problem with rising land prices? And the next is that I think I see many places where there is a large farm that buys the land from the smaller farms, so we have a lot of small ghost farms that stand empty around.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182448	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182449	I see no problem in raising land prices. Now, of course, we have very high food prices at the moment, and I therefore expect that there will be a further increase in land prices in the coming period, because with high prices on crops there will also be a basis for price increases.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182513	Thank you. Then there are no more comments, so thank you to the rapporteur. Then it's mr. Søren Espersen, Dansk Folkeparti. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182522	Thank you. The purpose of this proposal here is to make it clear that the government must be required to set up a State agricultural fund with a right of pre-purchase for agricultural land. In the Danish People's Party, we advocate nature, biodiversity, wildlife and a lot of other areas that ensure that Denmark remains a country with a healthy ecosystem. That is why we can nod to good intentions in the proposal, but the proposal will have consequences that we have a vertical disagreement with we need because we believe in private property to such an extent. We do not believe that it should ever be the task of the state to decide who may own land in Denmark. We also want the Danish agricultural land to remain in Danish hands, but how it is to be distributed in addition, we do not want to interfere in. That is why we do not believe that a state fund should be set up to buy private land from Danish farmers who are currently fulfilling a vital task in Danish society with a producing food. It can never be the task of the state to distribute agricultural land. For us it is a thought that belongs in a communist society in which the state owns and decides and no one has the freedom to decide for themselves. We believe that there are other ways of ensuring animal welfare, biodiversity and all the other intentions behind the proposal. If local communities want to create democratic ownership and local markets based on local productions, they should of course be welcome to do so. However, it must never and never be a matter for the state to decide. As far as possible, how the Danes want to do business must always be determined by the Danes themselves. We are not living in a planned economic society, and that is not something we should want to do. We believe that a desire to do business should come from talented people, the Danes themselves, and therefore we cannot endorse the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182713	Thank you. There are no comments and there are no rapporteurs from NB, LA or KD, so that is why it is Mrs Susanne Zimmer, the rapporteur for the proposers. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421182732	I miss the fact that we are showing some political courage. I am sorry that we are stuck in a way of thinking about politics and social development, which restricts us to solving the problems we face. Today, it is about the Free Greens' proposal to set up a state farm fund which could be a tool for converting our agriculture into smaller farms, for better agriculture and for more democratic agriculture. At the same time, it is a tool for giving nature more space and also getting more forests. In fact, if I am going to say so myself, I think it is quite a visionary proposal. It is a proposal which shows a little political courage, at least by comparison with the immediate positions we have heard today from the established parties. However, I am quite convinced that the rest of the population is quite a lot ahead of us in here when it comes to political courage. There are ideas and initiatives outside these walls where you are much more prepared to take a proposal like this seriously than we are in here. There are several funds which already have the same thinking going on. I have two reasons for this belief that someone outside is ahead of us. Firstly, the most progressive things we have adopted in this Parliament come from pressure from the population for a long time. This is true, for example. The law on climate change and the law on consent, political measures such as those we have often been sceptical about, which seem much more self-evident and necessary in the public. Secondly, the citizens' thing for the climate area, which represents a representative sample of the population, came in February of this year with a catalogue which recommends to us politicians that significant steps be taken to change our society, among other things. a reduction in animal production. Something that I overwhelmed and was very pleased with when I read the recommendations from the citizens' thing was that there was an overwhelming majority who lacked political courage and a Parliament that takes responsibility for the climate crisis. One example is that 85%. considers that the State should force the conversion of agricultural land and the conversion of land into forest. It doesn't seem like we're sneaking up on the 85% when we look at our conversation today. It is a recommendation from a citizen's thing and we are clearly inspired by that proposal, and that is what we are discussing today. Of course, we are also inspired by grassroots movements around which citizens come together in communities and take the land back and cultivate it more gently and with room for biodiversity, more than before. It happens both at home, but it also happens in our surroundings, abroad. We are also inspired by the work launched by the Socialist Government around the turn of the millennium, which was to examine how best to create a state farm fund. Then Anders Fogh Rasmussen came to power, and the idea was put in the drawer, and there it has been ever since, unfortunately. Agriculture is in crisis. Let us fix it by doing something better and providing a community that we want to see. The United Nations Climate Panel, our own Climate Council and experts repeatedly emphasise that we need to fundamentally transform our entire society if we want any chance of mitigating the ecological crisis. Part of this has changed land use and the way we use our land, more nature and less and better agriculture. We have multifunctional land distribution and we have some good experiences from there that we can easily spread across the country. If we are to have any hope of reversing developments with the loss of nature and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, we need to do something fundamentally different. Exceptional challenges require extraordinary efforts. Couldn't this be a way to do this? That is what we in the Free Greens think, and although we have not received much support for it today, I would nevertheless like to express my thanks for the debate. As rapporteur for the authors of the motion for a resolution, I would like to make a motion for a resolution on the creation of a State farm fund, and I would also refer to the comments accompanying the proposal and point it out to the goodwill of the House.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421183221	Thank you. No one else has asked to speak, so the debate is closed. I propose that the draft parliamentary resolution be referred to the Committee on the Environment and Food. And if no one objects, I consider it adopted. It's agreed. We are waiting a little, because we need a minister to the next point, and that is quite essential.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421183541	The debate is open, and I understand that Mr. Martin Lidegaard, Radical Left, has come to an agreement with the other parties because of the urgency that he is allowed to come first. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421183543	Thank you very much. Let me start by thanking my colleagues very much. This is the second time I have taken advantage of this good co-operation, and I very much regret that, but this time I am going to the evening show, and the whole agenda has been written up for two hours, and that is why I am in this situation. Thank you very much to the Social Democratic Party, the Left and the SF for allowing me to speak only today. It can be said that the foreign and security policy statement this year is unusual. We are in a situation where it is the tectonic plates throughout our security policy universe that change with the tragedy in Ukraine and, as always, when the tectonic plates move, it is difficult to know the conclusion in advance. We don't quite know what kind of world we're looking into. We know which world we would like to look into, but unfortunately it is not always the same. However, I think there are some new elements of Denmark's foreign and security policy on the horizon, which we at least in the Radical Left feel makes sense that Denmark is pursuing. Because when the tectonic plates move, when the earth, if I may say so, shakes, then the possibility of influencing the direction that the world takes is also greater than so many other times. The three elements that we believe Denmark should pursue in this situation, almost regardless of how Ukraine ends up, are the following: First, Europe can and should take greater responsibility for its own future and its own security. We can no longer take for granted that the United States can and will be the guarantor of our security. We must do what we can to preserve the transatlantic bond; we must try to build a NATO based on two strong pillars, a European and an American one which is mutually supportive, interconnected and which makes the overall NATO alliance stronger than ever before. And one example of how this is happening is that there is much evidence that Finland and Sweden may come to the conclusion that they must be part of the alliance in the future. But it also requires Europe to take greater responsibility because it is our neighbourhood, it is our geography. This applies both to the East, to the Western Balkans, to Russia, to the South, to the Middle East, to North Africa, and to the North, to the Arctic. In all these places we have an interest in strong cooperation. This is also closely linked to the second element that I think is already emerging, namely that security policy is obviously more than defence policy. It is also defence policy, and it is also stronger military capabilities that are obviously necessary in this situation, but it is just as much an energy policy that does not help feed Putin's war machine, which ensures a clean and climate-friendly energy supply, and which therefore also vaccinates us against the greatest security threat of all: climate and global warming. And it is also a development policy in which we are trying to lift northern Africa in order to stem uncontrollable migration, because terrorism, trade policy, economic policy and control of technology, and, above all, to link our defence policy with all these other elements of security policy, so that they are thought together across, and that we can work together for a stronger and more complete Europe, which also fights for our values, for the welfare and democracy and security of the rest of the world and for peace. Thirdly, there is something that suggests that Denmark should focus even more in the new picture on the elements that we are strongest at, and I think that when it comes to the Arctic, we are looking into a stronger kingdom community or a stronger partnership... you can call it many things... where the three countries that are today will hopefully be able to strengthen cooperation on, also in a wider Nordic context, if Finland and Sweden come along, to ensure what I feel is a common vision for the Arctic, namely a peaceful, sustainable and also a more prosperous society to the benefit of all the people living in the Arctic. Another element, which will be a Danish speciality in foreign and security policy, will be green energy. We are the best in the world for this, and we must be better at spreading and exploiting this, including security policy, including foreign policy. It is not a small thing, it is not a detail, but it has become a major policy, and coupled to technology ownership and technology development in our supply chains it will be one of the major areas of the future. Finally, linking development policy and foreign policy will be a strong Danish theme, where we could also have strong Nordic cooperation in the future we are looking into. There are many questions that remain unanswered, there are many things we cannot know today, but that is in these three areas: thinking Europe into a stronger role, thinking security wider so that we have both a military component, an energy component, trade, economics, development policy, migration, the cyber area, etc. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184129	Thank you for the rapporteur's speech. There are no comments. Then you can get to the Dinner Show. Then it's Mrs. Annette Lind. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184152	Thank you for that, President. This statement has been a long time in the process. First there was an evacuation from Afghanistan, then there was a pandemic, and most recently there was an invasion of Ukraine. So we canceled and had to hit it again, and now we have the chance, so thank you for that. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this foreign policy strategy. I fully understand that we are now setting the course for Denmark's role and commitment to the world in a completely new way in the years ahead. There is no doubt that we generally live in an increasingly unpredictable and uncertain and complex world. With Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine, Europe is currently in one of the most serious security policy crises since the Cold War. In such landmark moments it is absolutely crucial that Denmark takes the right side of history, stands with our allies and stands up for our values, even if it has a price, and it requires a value-policy compass. The world order created in the wake of World War II is increasingly being challenged. We saw this already before Russia's attack on Ukraine on 24 February, and that must be clear to everyone. The binding communities and the rule-based international work that we as a country enjoy can no longer take for granted. The world is in a global battle of values that challenges security and Denmark's interests. That is why, with the new foreign policy strategy, the government has presented a new compass to show the way forward when it comes to difficult choices to be made so that we know what we are fighting for, who we are fighting with and what we are fighting against. This is how we best promote Danish interests in a troubled world without fixed points of reference. Concrete challenges and threats come and go, but our values remain. Our values and interests are inextricably linked. That is why we must fight for our fundamental values together with our allies. Denmark must shoulder its responsibilities and contribute actively, also where it is difficult, and we do so; Denmark takes the lead. I would like to commend the Minister for the ambitious strategy that has been put forward. The strategy is based on a very comprehensive, thorough and thorough analysis of the whole composition and economy of the EEAS. In this case, a thorough examination of the challenges facing Denmark has been carried out in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It has also been mapped out how the EEAS funds are being used today and examined whether they can be used more effectively. This is new, which is why the strategy has been under way for some time now. The way forward is based on three key words: Values, reality and means of action. The strategy is based on all that Denmark stands for and must safeguard: the welfare society and the Danish model, human inviolable rights, freedom and equality and democracy, binding communities, right and duty, security and social mind and cohesion. At the same time, the strategy identifies the foreign policy reality in which Denmark finds itself today, the challenges that Denmark faces and the opportunities that we also have to seize, and then presents the strategy with the tools and measures that we need to use to make a concrete difference to Denmark and the world. The strategy consists of five pillars. I am now usually the first rapporteur, which is why I usually explain a little what it is in the papers. It is a value diplomacy in which Denmark must become more involved in the defence of democracy and binding international communities. It is a security diplomacy to strengthen the Danes' security in a troubled world with an increasingly complex threat picture. It is a climate diplomacy in which Denmark must take the lead in raising the global green ambition level. It is a migration diplomacy in which Denmark is fighting for a fairer asylum system. Finally, but not least, it is an economic diplomacy where we ensure a strong Danish economy with several Danish jobs and promote Danish sustainable solutions worldwide. Of course, if we are to achieve the goals of the strategy, we need a Danish diplomacy capable of fulfilling the task. That is why the Socialist Government has carried out a comprehensive structural restructuring of the External Action Service. At the same time, we have made up for many years of green harvesting savings. In a troubled world in which Denmark finds itself, we simply cannot afford to save on our diplomacy. At the same time, the strategy is based on a recognition that we need to use diplomatic forces where we can most effectively promote Danish values and interests. Therefore, the funds must be given priority in particular to strengthening Denmark's multilateral representations in NATO, the EU, the UN and Arctic diplomacy. For the value struggle that is taking place in the world requires strong Western unity, where we cooperate and fight for our common values and the rule-based international work. Denmark must be at the heart of the European Union and at the heart of NATO, take the lead in the United Nations and safeguard close transatlantic cooperation. The extensive restructuring of the External Action Service has also meant that funds have been redirected and closed down some of the Danish embassies in countries where Denmark has been present for many years. I am thinking here, among other things. in Argentina and Tanzania. I myself had the opportunity to speak to the Argentine ambassador before he went back to Argentina. This should not be interpreted as a political signal, but as a desire to use the forces where the need and effect are greatest. Overall, Denmark will come with the new strategy and transformation of the External Action Service to have more diplomats in the world, and this is so needed at a time when the world is breaking up and when the fight for our fundamental values is harder, but also more important than ever. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184811	Thank you. There are a few comments. Sir. Karsten Hønge, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184815	Thank you to Mrs Annette Lind for one, I think, both fine and visionary speech. There was a word that naturally echoed in the rapporteur's speech: value, which is also a key word in the strategy. But how can this emphasis on these Danish values be linked to the fact that the government is now proposing that the poorest countries pay the bill for accepting Ukrainian refugees?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184841	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184843	I do not think Denmark has anything to be ashamed of. We are the country in the world that meets the expectations of paying the price that has been agreed internationally. It is the case that we are in a crisis now that has never been seen before in our lifetime well to notice. That is why we are receiving very, very many refugees right now, and this is one way to do it. And it's a crisis, and that's why it's done this way. But I do not think we can get beyond the fact that we have a value-policy compass. When we meet enemies in the future and now we have to think about who we are fighting for, who we are fighting against, and what methods we are going to do it with, from time to time, because the enemy image is not the same as it was in the past. Therefore, I think it is so important that we use the Danish values that we all think are right, both at home, but also when we are out.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184942	Sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421184943	Oh, well, honestly, Danish values that we all think are right? I really must now ask Mrs Annette Lind to calibrate her value-policy compass, as was mentioned. How can one ever say in this government and as a Social Democrat that we are indeed facing an extraordinary challenge and extraordinary expenditure, but then look around and then take the money from where you are most poor? What is the explanation for this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185008	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185009	All in all, Denmark pays a lot of money for the development work. We are actually paying the 0.7% which is the target. Not many countries really do. What we do is that we are now helping in a crisis where we get really, very many people across our borders, who must be in our welfare community and who hopefully must have a job and also be happy to return home if it is the case that they have to be joined together with their family. But right now, we need the money.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185037	Thank you. Then it's mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185040	I would also like to thank Mrs Annette Lind for her speech. It is absolutely right, as Mrs Annette Lind said, that we need a strengthened foreign service. All honour and respect for the fact that a green harvesting method has been stopped, which has been for too many years under changing red and blue, but what has not been done is, for example, what has been done. to support around it, such as: The Left Party made a final financial bill, namely to present a concrete plan for more money to the External Action Service, so that instead of closing embassies and moving embassies, new embassies open up embassies in, among other things. The Caucasus and other places where it is needed and where we do not have any embassies today. So a specific question, because now we are united on a more strengthened one, must we say foreign policy in relation to referendums and 2-percent targets and all sorts of other things: will the Social Democracy also be ready to follow what the Left has asked for, namely that we should have a strengthened foreign service and therefore more embassies?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185137	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185138	Now Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen just as well as I have said yes to 2%. of our bnp on the defense budget. Of course, it is distributed in many different ways, but what is the difference and our method of doing things is that we have stopped the green harvesting method. What the former Left Government did was to take a little everywhere according to the salami method, and I have been a school teacher and head of school, and I know how hard it is for everyone working with a green harvesting method, and that is certainly not the right way to go. The 2%. I mean, it's gonna fall off our stuff out in the world, too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185222	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185224	I don't quite think that was an answer to what I asked. I asked if the Social Democracy would be ready for us to have a strengthened foreign service and therefore more money for the External Action Service, so that we can open more new embassies, and then suddenly we got something about a 2-percent objective for the military. I don't understand. I know it's the last of the night, but that's where the question is. And I have to admit that if the answer is no, which I must interpret as such, then I have to say: I do not understand that. For the whole of the speech by the Socialist Foreign Minister was that there are concrete threats to Denmark, and it is to be expected that we will have a strengthened foreign service.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185304	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185305	I guess it's only little parents who think it's at the end of the evening here at 7:00. But it is the case that we are strengthening in a great many ways, and I am quite sure that in this troubled world in which we are, we will also strengthen the External Action Service. I think that the rapporteur should put the same question to the Minister when he comes to the floor. I am quite sure that there will be strengthening, including in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185330	Thank you. Then it's mr. Søren Espersen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185333	Thank you. I shall deal with the subject of diplomacy and foreign service in a little more detail in the next statement, No. R 14. But I would just like to ask: if you want a strengthened foreign service and you know that it is out there, where you have eyes and ears and can see what is going on, why is it that you engage in the service I know that other countries have done it too, to expel Russian diplomats, and then we get a whole lot in the head here at home? It kind of puzzled me. I know that all countries did so, but there is something wrong with the fact that there is no possibility of hearing exactly what is going on in that country at the embassy in Moscow. Now they have gone home and there is not the same feeling among those who then come home or are going home; I do not know how it works. But every country did it, and I think it's so wrong. Should we not always hold on to our embassies abroad with full staff instead of what has happened here?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185428	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185429	I fully support the expulsion of those diplomats. Sir. Søren Espersen and I are both in the jury and have been given the explanation there. After all, the ambassador has not been expelled, and so is our ambassador in Moscow. It is important for Denmark still to have an ambassador in Moscow who can speak up for the Danes, and that is how it is. But if it is the case that there is someone we suspect not to do things according to the Danish order, I think it is appropriate to send people home.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185501	Sir. Søren Espersen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185502	But suddenly in 27 different countries you find out that exactly at their embassy there are 15 men who are spies, and then show them all out, sounds almost too imaginative to be right. I believe that the sanctions, and I will deal with this later, are good, our trade sanctions and all this, but diplomacy is held to the end. Well, the U.S. had full diplomatic service in Berlin right up to Pearl Harbor. Then, of course, they could no more, but there were full staff, because that was where they learned what was going on in Nazi Germany. So I think it's an interesting phenomenon. We should not throw out diplomats unless they are notoriously spies and have been to the detriment of Denmark; that is a completely different situation. But that's not fair.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185553	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185554	I have enormous confidence that our intelligence service knows what they're doing. This isn't a political decision alone. It is, of course, on the basis of an assessment, and I have great confidence in it. I think it's right what you do. The ambassador is still here, and we still have an embassy in Moscow where we can work from.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185618	Thank you. Then there's no more comments, and then it's sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421185630	Thank you. First of all, thank you to the government for giving us the foreign policy strategy and full understanding that it was delayed, because the whole idea was, of course, that it is really, really difficult when there is much else to do in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, that is a little surprising, because what the Socialist Foreign Affairs rapporteur forgot to tell us was that we had actually been promised that it would come after the Arctic strategy had come out. And it may be that I have not been awake enough at my e-mail inbox, but I have not yet seen the strategy on the Arctic, which is why I look forward to when the Secretary of State comes up and hopefully can tell you that it is just on the stairs. Because I think I am speaking on behalf of all parties when I simply say that it is really, really important that we very, very soon discuss the whole situation in the Arctic, and that is why, of course, I also expect what the government is saying to be that they think so and that, therefore, this strategy on the Arctic should come very, very soon. So it must be right on the stairs, expected in a few weeks or something, and I look forward to that very, very much, so we will also have a discussion on it. Then, of course, it is difficult to start anywhere other than with the situation in Ukraine. It is, of course, one of the things we need to say very clearly, namely that it is actually nice that we in the Danish Parliament, across ideological divides, are completely united in turning both strongly against Putin's aggressiveness, but also at the same time supporting Ukraine in their needs, both in terms of arms aid, military aid and other aid, but also in relation to what is at least crucial on the left side, and that is that, when we hopefully also stay one day after the war, we are equally clear in terms of reconstruction, so that Ukraine can come up and again become this emerging European democracy as they were until Putin began to destroy that dream. And then it is just important that we also at the same time find out how to hold onto the pro-European approach, because, of course, we should not create some kind of hasty fast-track solution for Ukraine so that they can join the European Union before they are ready, we are quite in agreement on that, but on the other hand we also need to find a solution so that we can at least be guaranteed or guaranteed as well as guaranteed their safety, so that hopefully they will not get back into the same situation and at the same time also help them in all the necessary ways. Then there is the question of China. China is a greater and greater threat, and I must admit that I believe that here too I share what many others probably share, namely the fear of what China can do in relation to Taiwan. Now I have the exquisite honour of being chairman of the Danish Parliamentary Network on Taiwan here in the Folketing, and therefore it is very, very important for us in the Left that we do everything we can to clearly draw a red line in the sand in relation to China's possible desire to exploit that the Western world is looking a lot at Ukraine at the moment and then can abuse it to go in and make an aggressiveness, perhaps a direct invasion of Taiwan. That is where we must support everything we can in relation to the fact that international law also applies. Although it is far away from us geographically, it is certainly an area that we need, and we support everything we can at all, and I believe and hope that the government will agree with that. One of the areas that I also think is very important is, of course, also to look back on Afghanistan. A great deal has been said about this, but I will not continue to do so, even though we can discuss what went wrong and did not go wrong in relation to the evacuation from Afghanistan. Our position on the Left side is clear: we think that we were late in the evacuation process, but what is important in this context is the discussion about what we are doing now, and it should just sound rock-proof on the Left side, that it is one hundred percent important that we do not go out and make a de facto, indirect or direct recognition of the Taliban as a government. For all that, we have to say the PR show that they did after they had taken over power, that they were the Taliban version 2.0, we start to see the evidence on was vertical lie and vertical lie. After all, we see that the repression of both women's rights and all kinds of other rights has started, not least in the cities outside Kabul, and that is why it is important that we do not go in any way and recognise this medieval regime of terror, as unfortunately it is, but rather look at whether there is in any way an aid to emerging pro-democratic forces, which we are beginning to hear a few, I recognise that it is few, yet optimistic, assessments of which may be fertile. We had the opportunity to meet with some pro-democratic forces, rebel movements, call it what you want in the Folketing some time ago, and I think that if it is true what they say, namely that they have the opportunity to build up an alternative to the Taliban, then Denmark must also be ready, just as hopefully many of our friends are ready, with full support for it, so that we can build up an alternative to the Taliban terrorist regime. In my questions to the Socialist Foreign Affairs rapporteur, I was referring to the fact that, on the part of the Left, it is crucial that when the world becomes more dangerous, we need a strengthened defence, which is why it is good that the government finally agreed to what the blue bloc had demanded, namely the advance of the defence negotiations and an objective of 2%, so that is a good thing, thank you for that. However, what we are still missing is a complete clarification of how we can bring about the enhanced foreign service, which is also part of the agreement. That is why I put forward it in my question, because it is very, very clear from the Left that we want more embassies. If we compare with the Nordic countries, we have far too few embassies and there are definitely black areas around the world where we are not present but should be present. So this has to be seen very, very much, I think, sincerely and as an outstretched hand on our part, in that in the negotiations that have already begun, it is certainly our wish that the strengthened foreign service translates into several embassies around the world. That is a good thing, and I think we should take this opportunity to mention that the common agreement between the old parties on security also includes a vote on our defence reserve. And, of course, we clearly support that we can become part of enhanced European cooperation in this area. Because whether you like it or not, we just want to be in a new world picture where the Americans are pulling more and more into themselves. This will happen both under a Joe Biden administration, but of course it will also happen at express speed if there is a Trump version 2.0 administration, and therefore it is important that Denmark is also fully and wholeheartedly involved in European cooperation. Then it is also very important that we do not forget an area where we have also been active, but which is unfortunately moving a little away from the media agenda, because unfortunately there are so many other areas to focus on, and that is the Middle East. It is the fight against the Islamic State, where unfortunately we are again beginning to see very, very alarming reports that the Islamic State has too strong a power base to be able to build away something that can both harm the people who live in the area, but also on the long track can be detrimental to us. That is why I just have to repeat what has been a mantra for the Left for a very long time, at least all the years I have been a foreign rapporteur, and it is now a few years, and that is that we will have to give more direct help to those who are on the ground and who are fighting for us. That is, the Kurds. I know that there are all sorts of geopolitical considerations, I know that the Turkish Government will do everything it can to make it difficult, but if we want to ensure that there is something that is just like stability and, above all, that the Islamic State is being defeated, then we will not get around the fact that the Kurds are the ones who must have the bulk of that responsibility, and they can only do so if they also receive help and support from us. That is why it is really, really important. I can at least promise that this is an area that we on the Left will pursue more and more, so that hopefully we will also get the government to agree that we can start giving direct help to the Kurdish people, and I call them allies in this important fight, because it is so important. So all in all, there is enough to tackle, one certainly cannot say that being the Foreign Affairs rapporteur has become more boring, at least in relation to last year, unfortunately, but that also means that there is enough to do, and we will then try to do so in the future.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421190634	Thank you. Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no brief comments. We move on to the SF rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421190648	It is good with the great focus on IT security, cyberattacks and hybrid wars. We need to focus much more on digital security in critical infrastructure, as well as the increasing number of attempts to undermine democracy through, for example, Fake news. SF supports Danish armaments in that area. In addition to defending Danish interests in isolation, we can also assist our allies now, but especially in the future. It is a clearly better investment for Danish foreign and security policy than the military adventures in which we have participated, among others. in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, I believe that the Danish people have remained wondering about what Denmark was doing in the wars in which the militaristic foreign policy sucked us into. The government should take a clear stand against the unilateral militaristic focus of the last 20 years in foreign policy, when the government still wants new lines. A modern security, defence and foreign policy is much more interwoven with other policy areas than in the past, which is why we need to back up hardcore military defence with climate, energy and supply policies and with aid and food security. Sustainable, renewable energy is freedom energy. In fact, we must free ourselves from the energy supply of foreign powers: it is also a genuine security policy. Then I would like to say that I am very pleased that the climate struggle, women's rights and the building of democracy and the rule of law take up a great deal. We share that priority. But we must be very keen on where and how. In Afghanistan, we built girls' schools, and now they're in gravel. We have been to Mali and now we have been kicked out of the military junta that seized power along the way. The whole region is now under pressure from Islamist terrorist groups and Russia. What really is the government's evaluation of the years of effort? And what is the government's conclusion to Esbern Snare's search for pirates in the Gulf of Guinea? I also lack a clearer recognition from the government of where and how Denmark can actually make a humanitarian difference in the world. After all, the government is now calling for us to be, as it is said, at the heart of NATO and at the heart of the European Union. This is certainly a new course since Denmark joined the so-called savings gang in the EU in the summer of 2020. And I guess the whole thing can't seriously be caused by the war in Ukraine. 96 times in the 31-page strategy, the word value is mentioned in some context. In comparison, the word interest is mentioned only 31 times. I think that the government should make it clear that this battle of values, which is called for, is not equal to the values that in the 00s sent Danish soldiers into hopeless, hopeless desert wars rather than to defend real Danish security interests. The situation in the South China Sea, where the Chinese fleet is under very strong construction, is dangerous. The same can be said when Taiwan is constantly faced with threats from Fastlandskina. The area will probably be the next major conflict area where the United States is engaged. How does the government view Denmark's role in that area? Is it Danish security interest? I don't think so. For we must actually have more focus on the obvious Danish interests, on Europe and on the Arctic, on our alliances and on those areas where we can do something in advance in terms of competence, especially when it comes to the climate struggle and IT security. In these cases, we must equip with drones, radars and IT equipment. We must work together where we have clear interests: the Kingdom Community in the Arctic; the European Union in Europe; NATO in our military security; the United Nations and the OSCE in the field of peace and stability in the world. And that applies to trade, because if we do not pay a fair price for tomatoes from African countries on the world market, then their young men will, as it were, be on Europe's labour markets. It is good that the government has stopped the recurring and almost automatic cuts at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it is actually necessary to move in the opposite direction, so that we have a clearly stronger foreign service. The climate crisis could end up as the overriding security policy problem if we do not put turbo on the green transition. The strategic partnerships that have already been concluded should be greener. As part of the empire, the Arctic regions form an almost eeriely perfect background curtain for Danish armaments in the fight against climate change, also on the world stage. Moreover, the Arctic fills very little in the strategy, but this is probably due to the delay in the common independent strategy for the Arctic, which we are to develop together with Greenland and the Faroe Islands. To put it briefly, SF's military focus is on our immediate own interests. Denmark must not participate in any more desert wars unless it is humanitarian action at the request of the United Nations. We need to get more climate, democracy and the rule of law into our priorities. And to put it another way, the desert boots have to be replaced with snowshoes. We must have a critical focus on China and Russia and their roles, i.e. how we best protect ourselves in Denmark and for the benefit of our allies. The whole world must work together to resolve the climate crisis, but democracy and human rights are not negotiable.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191413	Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191414	Thank you to the rapporteur for the very interesting perspectives, but I cannot help noticing that the rapporteur called the Danish military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and so on. for fairy tales that were not really in Denmark's interests. I would remind you that there have therefore been a large number of terrorist attacks here in Europe directly linked to the Islamic State and also inspired by the Islamic State. We have also had terrorist attacks here in Denmark. Does the rapporteur really believe that the operations we have been engaged in in these countries for example? to defeat the Islamic State, had not been in Denmark's interest?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191452	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191454	I must say, then, that I have every respect for those people who have helped to resolve the conflicts. I have every empathy for the families who have lost a relative. That is why it is hard to say, I really think, when you look back at 20 years, that although we can say that the education that some girls have been given, you cannot take away from them. I am in on it, we must all say that it was a failure and not just a failure, but a tragic failure, because it now turns out that it is all in ruins. That's how you have to look at it. I would also like to say, given that Mr. Marcus Knuth takes in the Iraq War that precisely the illegal war in Iraq, Denmark's completely hopeless involvement in an illegal war to stand as close to the United States as possible, was one of the foundation stones for the Islamic state to be formed at all. We helped destabilise and destroy both Iraq and Syria without having an alternative to it, thus making the future very difficult for ourselves by laying the foundations of IS.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191557	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191558	I can at least admit that we look at history and that perspective very differently. If we look forward, Islamic State is still a threat in the Middle East. Michael Aastrup Jensen also mentioned the fact that, despite Ukraine, we should not forget the other threats that are in the world. So does the rapporteur think that if the Islamic State again grows larger or remains a threat to the interests of Europe and Denmark, is that not something we should do about?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191621	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191623	We have to do something about that. However, I think we need to look at the experience we have. And what are the experiences of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya? Are they that it's a military response? There's no sign of that. The challenge is obvious: the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but at the moment perhaps just as serious in the Sahel, where Islamic terrorist groups are growing large. Should the response to the challenge that may come for Western Europe both directly through terrorism, but also through the migratory pressure that may come, be a military involvement in the Sahel? I find that hard to see.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191702	Thank you. Then it's mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191704	I need to get some clarification on that. In other words, the SF's response to the concrete threat posed by the Islamic State terrorist movement is that we should not respond back militarily. Should we send a delegation of diplomats to the Islamic State and try to negotiate with them, or what exactly does the SF think we should do, other than fight them militarily? Because this is a terrorist organisation, and so, I admit, I do not dare to take down such a negotiating delegation to the Islamic State. I do not think that much will come out of it, and that is why I still want to hold on to the fact that when it comes to some terrorist organisations, there is only one answer, also for the sake of our security, and that is military. Doesn't the SF agree with that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191743	Sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191744	Well, instead of having some theoretical discussion about what our answer should be, let's look at what we've been involved in. Can anyone point to just a small success story with regard to Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and the Sahel? No, in fact, there is not when the answers alone are the militaristic foreign policy where the answer is additional military. So you can only see that it has not succeeded, rather the opposite. We have made a lot of sacrifices, and again I want to express my deepest sympathy for the people who have sacrificed their lives and their families, but we just have to say that that was not the answer. And I would say that the liberation of Afghanistan will be the work of the Afghan people themselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191824	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191826	So SF's answer to Islamic State is that we're not doing anything. Well, I just have to stick to what happened in concrete terms. It was because we and other allies went in and stopped the Islamic State from taking over Baghdad. They were standing in Baghdad's suburbs, and it was first that President Obama woke up. That is why the Islamic State was allowed to grow large and strong. It was because red lines and everything else were broken, so that the pro-democratic forces that were in Syria at that time were slaughtered without any movement anywhere in the Western world. Apparently, it's SF's cup of tea, because apparently that's what SF says. That is what our response to Islamic terrorist organisations is: we just stay at home and hope that they do not hit us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191906	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191907	I think that for many good reasons we should be happy that it is not Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen, who sits in the White House, and he certainly didn't do it at the time. Anyway, this isn't the first time we've seen that Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen is smarter than anyone else in the world, and you can just say that I still lack the hint of evidence that Denmark through military involvement should be the answer to knock down the Islamic State. After all, we fully share our common hatred of the Islamic State and of Islamist terrorist groups, including those in the Sahel belt, but there is probably no one who believes that the answer should be that we should now perhaps send soldiers to the Sahel. It's not.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191940	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the SF rapporteur. Then it is Enhedslisten's rapporteur. Here you go, sir. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421191955	Thank you to the Minister for the statement on the government's foreign and security policy strategy. I am very, very much in agreement when it is stated at the outset that such a strategy must set a course after a quote from the value policy compass. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Because as the Minister himself writes, we know what we are fighting for, who we are fighting for and what we are fighting against. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, So let me start by pinpointing four of the Enhedslisten's policy points. Firstly, ensuring a sustainable future for the entire earth's population. It is about stopping man-made climate change, it is about full turbo on the green transition, and it is about help, unconditional aid to developing countries, in order to adapt. Why? Because we have a climate debt. We have that CO2 It is not developing countries. It may be that some of them emit more today than we do, but historically we have a debt. Secondly, defend democracy, human rights and the freedom of the individual. It is a fight against all forms of oppression and discrimination. We must always stand on the side of the persecuted in speech and action and also apply it when it costs. Thirdly: ensure social development for all • against exploitation, increased inequality between countries and between populations • because inequality creates conflicts, inequality creates flows of refugees. That is why it is so important that we maintain development aid for the poorest regions of the world. And fourthly, secure peace and people of self-determination. No to intervention wars, armaments and threats of nuclear war. The 1800s were marked by colonial occupation. The 1900s were marked by the battle with them and the East-West conflict, where countries were described as backyards, and then since the Second World War the threat that even smaller wars could develop into nuclear wars • unconditional defence of the peoples' right to self-determination! Why is the above so important? It's not of goodness. It's not for the sake of anyone else. It is for our own sake and for the sake of the world, because these principles, because these pointers and their adherence in practice are actually essential for us to be sure that civilisation has a direct future at all when we talk about nuclear weapons, when we talk about climate change, and indirectly through all the consequences and wars, etc., that can come if we do not ensure more equality if we do not guarantee self-determination and democracy. What does it take to get in that direction? We believe that we are actively involved in international organisations. We believe that there is far too little priority for the United Nations. There is a lot of talk about making soldiers available for one thing or another. What about Denmark's contribution to making soldiers available to the UN? Is not the reality that the United Nations is standing before the door of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs begging that we make more available, but that they get a no every time? In any case, I would urge the Foreign Minister in his reply to tell us how many soldiers we have deployed in the service of the United Nations today. I think it can be counted on two hands. I think it can be counted on two hands. Then we want binding international cooperation based on minimum standards wherever we are. For Enhedslisten is not an all-or-nothing party. We have our criticism of the European Union, which is based on the four freedoms, which are not freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and democracy, but something about the free movement of market forces, etc., but we must, where we are, also in the European Union, work to comply with those points. As I said, we want to work wherever we are. Then we must create coalitions of the willing. I recognise that the word may have gotten a bad ring because of the Iraq war, but it is sometimes necessary to bring together those who are willing to resolve a particular effort. Then we need to focus on prevention and prevention, because prevention is cheaper than repairing. That is why it is not very wise for the government to have removed 2 billion. kr. from development aid to finance aid to Ukrainian refugees. This means stopping peace and stability efforts in areas with huge problems. What does that mean? Is that where the next wars are created? Is that where the next dictators are created, which oppress people, etc. And then, for everything in the world, we must avoid double standards. There is nothing worse, in my opinion, than having a standard for someone and a different standard for some others. We have a standard that is based on our pointers, and we're judging everyone on them. And then I think it is particularly important, in conclusion, to say that a country like Denmark must have what has now come to be called strategic autonomy in the European Union. This means that, to a large extent, we must be able to confront others if they violate what are our principles, understood in such a way that they cannot shut down our gas, shut down oil or whatever can happen. So is that the line that has been, and is that the line that is added up? Yeah, you can hope that's the line that's being set up. But if we look at the line that has been, it's everything but what we've seen, for example. To close your eyes to Putin for years. It's like Putin's come to power recently. We know that Putin's war in Ukraine is waged with the war chest he built from oil and gas he has sold to our part of the world. I'm sorry! We were warned, weren't we? Now I am here with a quote from Mrs Mai Villadsen from 30 October 2019, where she says that with Nord Stream 2 we are increasing Europe's dependence on Russian gas, but Russia should not be rewarded for its aggressive behaviour around the world; it is important that Denmark and Europe become independent of fossil fuels from a brutal regime like Russian. When I read it, I thought I'd seen it before. And then I went in and Googled Søren Søndergaard, Putin, gas, and then I found a quote from 2011 from a speech in the European Parliament saying that the EU and the countries that rely on energy from Putin's Russia are deeply naive or deliberately support his authoritarian regime. Well, it's not like you haven't been warned. You've been warned, but you've done, what should we say, money interests, what do I know, laziness, I don't know, go ahead. Another example: Turkey. While we're sitting here, there's an attack going on in Northern Iraq. Turkish forces have crossed the border with Northern Iraq. Turkish forces bomb massively among the Yazids who have suffered more than enough from the Islamic State and among Kurds in refugee camps. That is what is happening at the moment. It's been announced, and it's nothing new. It follows the attack on Rojava in 2019. It follows the attack on Afrin in 2018. And what was it that the Danish government said about Afrin in 2018? Turkey's legitimate security policy interests should be remembered. I am really glad that we do not have a situation today where there are some parties that stand up and say: let us just remember Putin's legitimate security policy interests. Because attacks into another country, bombing of populations is in any case unacceptable. And what is the result of our closing our eyes to that? That the repression of human rights continues in Turkey, the repression of its own people supported by the European Union, and that, under the cover of it, the Islamic State is growing. The Islamic State is growing up and has hardly stood stronger in recent years than they are in the area today. Very troubling. Again an example of the fact that if action does not follow words, it comes with a price. And the last example I would like to mention is Tibet. Well, we've gotten the Tibet case in which some poor cops first got blamed for breaking the constitution by pulling the tibet flag, and later it became clear that it was a culture that existed among political leaders and official work in Denmark that such things were accepted against China. How could things go so wrong? Not only did we accept oppression in China, we also accepted oppression in Denmark to please China. How could things go so wrong? The world pays a high price for indulgence in those areas, and the price can be even higher. I think it is good to have a value-policy compass, but then it must also be followed. Otherwise, we're gonna end up like a windbag.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193020	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193023	As far as I can decipher the political banking sounds of the Enhedslisten headquarters, it seems to me that NATO is a very good idea, at least at the moment. That's why I'd like to ask Mr. Søren Søndergaard tells us: What is really the best thing about NATO?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193040	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193041	The best thing about NATO at present is that it helps prevent a conventional attack on certain countries that are on the brink of Russia and belong to former Soviet republics. It's the best thing about NATO.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193101	Sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193103	So Enhedslisten now thinks that NATO is both a fire-good idea and can also highlight things that are good about being a member of NATO. I understand that Enhedslisten's policy continues to be such that a dramatic disarmament of Denmark must be started, perhaps more than a halving of military expenditure. How's sir? Søren Søndergaard wants Denmark to be part of an association which even provides good things and which you are very happy about, while at the same time paying far less than half of the quota that the association requires of its members?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193131	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193133	I think, sir. Karsten Hønge, that we have to realize, when we talk about these problems, that they are more complicated than that you can just say what's best, and when you've said the best, you don't say any more. What is our starting point is that if we thought that Denmark should be withdrawn from NATO tomorrow, then we would probably have put forward proposals for it in the Folketing, and we have not. But it is absolutely right that we have a fundamental criticism of NATO and NATO's intervention wars outside Europe, among others. in Libya, a completely fundamental criticism. And it is quite right that we do not see NATO as the solution to the necessary security structure in Europe, because it shows that there are some blocs and that security structure must be the basis for that. I think that is our major task.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193216	Thank you. Then it's mr. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193218	Thank you to the rapporteur. I just want to hear very briefly whether the Enhedslisten will welcome it if it is the case that Sweden and Finland apply for membership of NATO.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193226	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193228	We have a fundamental view, as I said before, of the right of nations to self-determination, which means that it is up to Sweden and Finland to decide whether they want to be members of NATO. So that is their decision, just as it was Ukraine's decision to apply. Of course, once they have made that decision, we will deal with it; that is clear.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193248	Sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193249	But can the rapporteur not come a little closer to that than it is going to deal with it? My question was: if they apply for membership, will the Enhedslisten welcome it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193258	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193259	No, I cannot get any closer, because it requires them to do so before we decide on it. Well, I understand the logic of all of us saying that it is a very good idea for them to do so, but that of course they decide for themselves. We say: they decide for themselves, and then we decide what they have done. But we see it, of course, in the light of how we help solve two problems. That's where it's gonna be difficult, sir. Karsten Hønge. We need to deal with a current security threat, while at the same time leaving some clues to a future security architecture that is not based on the fact that there are blocks in Europe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193340	Thank you. Then it's mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193341	You want to ask so many questions when Enhedslisten is here in relation to foreign and security policy, so I ask two questions. One question follows on from what Mr. Marcus Knuth mentioned it. As far as that is concerned, this also means that Ukraine must seek NATO membership, I assume, and that means that the Enhedslisten will say that they are, of course, fully entitled to do so, and that therefore it is not something that Putin should interfere in at all. I guess so. That was question one. Question two is that the Enhedslisten has previously spoken for a Nordic defence alliance. I assume that if Sweden and Finland join NATO, then that means that a Nordic defence alliance can at least not be made up of very many countries and that it must therefore be recognised that only NATO can function or what?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193427	Sir. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193428	In other words, it is absolutely right that if Sweden and Finland join NATO, the basis for imagining in the short term a Nordic defence alliance as an independent thing is gone. That goes without saying. You don't have to discuss that. In relation to the second question, I would like to say that, of course, the Ukrainian people have the right to self-determination. That was the whole content, the whole basis of my speech. They have the right to decide to seek NATO membership if they wish. Something else is, of course, what is wise, and they must discuss and decide that with themselves, and then we must decide what we say to that request. That is also the case with the European Union, and I believe that I agree very much with Mr Tugendhat. Michael Aastrup Jensen says that we must do a great deal to help Ukraine develop democracy, so that if they wanted to, they could join the European Union. However, we must also bear in mind that we do not want to create an EU for countries that are extremely corrupt or where democratic rights do not work as we want them to work.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193532	Sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193533	Just so I understand: that means that when the Nordic defence alliance cannot be done, there are only two alternatives. This means that you either stand alone in the world or you are a member of NATO. So what does the Foreign Affairs rapporteur for the Enhedslisten want from the scenario that Denmark is mutters alone in the world or member of NATO?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193556	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193556-2	I mean, it's kind of uninteresting what the Foreign Affairs rapporteur for the Enhedslisten wants. What is interesting is what Enhedslisten wants, and there it is, then, that we take a position on it at an annual meeting, and this point is put at our annual meeting. That is where we will discuss it, of course we will do it, even in full transparency. I mean, that discussion is going to be there, and I'm sure it's gonna be called split and that sort of thing okay, okay, but there's gonna be another discussion. 'Cause I think everyone's a little surprised at what happened to Putin. Because if you're not surprised, it's that you've been pouring money into his war chest for years, after all, a crime. Then it's not just naivety or stupidity, it's a crime.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193640	Thank you, sir. Søren Søndergaard. There are no more brief comments, and that is why we are going to go to the rapporteur of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go, sir. Marcus Knuth.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421193652	Thank you, President. I am here with my speech to R 11, which I had planned to hold back in February when the statement was scheduled to be debated for the first time. In fact, it has been planned several times. In fact, I do not think I have seen a statement rescheduled so many times. One of the times was just about 24 February the day when Russia invaded Ukraine and the speech that I had planned to give back then was such an elaborate comment on the government's foreign and security policy strategy from January this year. It's a strategy that goes across the board. I don't know if it's new terms... value diplomacy, security diplomacy, climate diplomacy, etc. That was a great way to use some new terms. In general, therefore, our idea was that it is a fine strategy, but there is not much new in it, and there was not much new about funding either. But common to both my speech and the strategy of the government was, of course, that they were written at a time not very long ago when we naively assumed that the kind of brutality that Europe experienced during World War II, the kind of thinking in which one simply invades with violence another country one wants to possess, was something that belonged to the past. In the strategy and in my speech, of course, we were concerned about Russia's threatening behaviour, and this was also reflected in our debates on the Arctic and Ukraine, etc. I do not think that many of us had imagined in our wildest imagination what came after 24 February: the new world order that we are facing now is a world order in which Europe is at war, Ukraine is being bombed and where we truly fear the use of nuclear weapons on European soil. That is why I am actually sincerely pleased that Mette Frederiksen has just visited Ukraine to see for herself the Russian aggression and to offer even more Danish assistance to the Ukrainians. I had the opportunity to visit Kyiv myself almost two weeks ago with Rasmus Jarlov and a delegation of approx. 30 Members of the European Parliament. I hope and also have the impression that the message we received two weeks ago from the President of the Ukrainian Parliament is the same as Mette Frederiksen (Third Vice-President, Prime Minister)... the Prime Minister, thank you, President, has now returned, and that is what the Ukrainians say over and over again: that they need more weapons and stronger weapons. It may sound primitive, but having experienced Ukraine, it is the only right thing to do. To be precise, the President of the Ukrainian Parliament said to us: the best emergency aid Ukraine can get is arms. A lot of Ukrainian men want to fight, to contribute, but even something as simple as small arms is not enough for all men, not to mention more sophisticated weapons against aircraft, ships, etc. So I will not use this speech to talk about climate diplomacy and security diplomacy, and it is not to blame it, but right now we are in the midst of a crisis. I place particular emphasis on arms supplies for the reason that back in March, about a week into the war, when Ukraine asked Denmark for weapons, our government could not find as much as a hand grenade. We had several debates about it, and it was only when we were several parties and rapporteurs who also know a little about the defence that pushed and reminded us that Denmark was among other things. has an extensive stockpile of armored weapons that the government managed to find anyway, I think it was 2,700 older armored weapons that have then been sent to Ukraine • usable armored weapons, but not as sophisticated as that, for example. Britain and the United States have delivered. Meanwhile, over the past few weeks, more NATO countries have sent far more weapons, much more sophisticated weapons than those supplied by Denmark, and our NATO allies have done so, as Russia's brutality, violence just grows and grows. This also increases the willingness to support Ukraine even more. Today, the Prime Minister has announced an additional contribution of 600 million. I really hope that we will do what our allies do just to look into weapons systems that are as sophisticated as possible and listen to Ukraine in terms of what they need. The older armored weapons we sent were very good, but we need to keep up with the pace at which the war is developing. Now I have spent part of my speaking time talking directly about Ukraine, although of course it is an overall statement on the government's foreign and security policy strategy. I would also just like to remind you that, in a conflict that we are in with Ukraine, we should not forget the other areas in which Denmark's security policy should be razor sharp: Arctic, Greenland, Baltic, Baltic, where there are Danish soldiers, Afghanistan, as Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen mentioned. I also met with the delegation from, I think, the remnants of the government we had supported for 20 years. It was sad to sit before them and personally know a number of those who fled and who, fortunately, are still alive there are also some who are not it and sit back with the feeling that we let the Afghan Government burst together, where we might have done something more to help them survive, because we can see what the result is. That said, I am glad that the world we are in now, a world that is quite different from when I wrote my original speech, has resulted in, despite the fact that the backdrop is a terrible war in Ukraine, that the Social Democracy, the Left, the SF, Radicals have come together in a massive increase in Danish defence over the coming years, and that at long last, well enough in a while, we are going up on the almost magically 2%. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. Martin Lidegaard is now here so he no longer said he was happy that Europe takes more responsibility. I share that. He also said, and now I have to be careful how I quote Martin Lidegaard, something like that we should not necessarily be able to count on the United States for all time and eternity. I do not agree with that view. The United States is a cornerstone of NATO, and I hope it is forever and ever. In any case, I would like to express my thanks to the parties supporting the huge boost that we are now bringing out of our defences, which I hope will also be reflected in our foreign service, which the Left is very much aware of. We owe this to our partners in NATO, and that is something for which we, at least conservatives, have been fighting for a long time. So thank you to the parties that support the agreement and thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421194319	Thank you, sir. Marcus Knuth. There are no brief comments. So here it is, sir. Søren Espersen from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421194333	Thank you, and thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his statement, and I look forward to a good discussion today. I think it is already in progress. People & Security had a very interesting review this weekend of how bad it really looks for Denmark's defence in all areas, i.e. ships, submarines, tanks, fighters, infantry vehicles, military service, reserve units, air protection, where they have been cutting down and cutting down for decades. The same thing was also discovered suddenly in Sweden, where the Chief of Defense could no longer keep his mouth too heavy and clean in an interview made it clear that if the reduction policy continued, in 10-12 years' time there would no longer be a Swedish defence. It made an impression in the Reichstag, where a large majority reversed the course and started cleaning up and provided the necessary funds. Norway had long since set in motion and announced that two per cent had now been achieved effectively. We have always known what this is all about in Finland. You know that when you share a 1,300 km long border with Russia and know your history. Note that everything I list here took place long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In Denmark we are not so bold and foresightful, so we waited until the Russians had attacked Ukraine, and then we thundered towards the 2%. Or did we? No, we didn't. Because we have to wait 10 to 12 years before we reach the target. The Germans didn't need that long. You can settle for two years, and I must confess that I do not understand what it is that means that the Germans are so much faster. We are as advanced technologically and economically as the Germans are. But now something has been set in motion, and the forthcoming defence settlement will then show where we stand. The Danish People's Party proposed almost a year ago that we set a completely new course for how to make defence reconciliation. We proposed innovation, vision and purpose. As you know, a defence settlement sets the framework for defence, preparedness and the work of the Home Guard, but just as important is a power arrow for what we want with the country's security response. We must also mentally adopt a new approach, an approach in which the fighting force of defence is no longer determined by the Ministry of Finance, but instead we ask ourselves a fundamental question about what should clearly be the primary task of the defence: how long should Danish forces be able to defend the country independently against an enemy attack until our NATO allies can come to our aid? In this way, we want the order of the day turned upside down, where the defence today must confine itself to defining and fulfilling its tasks within an economic framework assigned to the defence before looking at what tasks the defence should perform at all. In our view, Danish forces should be able to defend Denmark for perhaps 2 to 3 weeks until our NATO allies can come to our aid. Then we will have to calculate how many soldiers and how much material it takes to achieve this ambition. Danish soldiers solve the tasks they are assigned to, but the question is whether the defence will be assigned to the right tasks. Every defence's most important task should be the defence of the homeland. For Denmark as a member of NATO, this means that we must be credible in defending Denmark together with our allies. The defence cannot today, as NATO has also concluded, and certainly not independently in the 2 to 3 weeks that we want the defence to be able to hold an invading enemy rod. Because we need soldiers, more resources and more material. The defense now consists of relatively small highly specialised units, which can be sent at short notice to distant skies. The expedition defense was a logical consequence of the first 1990s scaling down of defence from the extent and robustness it had during the Cold War and the subsequent extreme specialisation. For the uncertainty in Europe is back, and the carefree 1990s and the belief in an eternal European peace, which was the reason for the disarmament of the defence up through the 1990s and the 00s, got a serious jaw rattle with first the blossom of Islamic terrorism and then with Russia's peculiar act in its vicinity and thus relatively close to Denmark's borders. First it was Crimea, later Ukraine and with real threats to the Baltic States and Georgia. For a long time, airspace violations and very large Russian military exercises had been part of the order of the day, so we knew what could come and, as mentioned, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Finland did something about it while we waited. A natural question then is what it takes to achieve that level of ambition. Yes, to answer that, we can of course look to other Nordic countries such as Sweden or Finland or NATO member Norway. The experience of this clearly points to the need for much more conscripts, a longer period of military service, calls for larger mobilization forces and more equipment in stock, so that the mobilization forces have weapons, vehicles and equipment. In short, it is a question of vitalising what is today called the total defence system, which is made up of reservers and the Home Guard respectively. In addition, the defence needs capabilities that can contribute to the defence of the entire kingdom. These are investments in several naval vessels with a potent armament, many more combat aircraft which can also operate under Arctic conditions, and possibly also the restoration of the submarine system, which will also strengthen our ability to operate in the Baltic Sea and in Danish waters. So we in the Danish People's Party want a significant shift in defence policy from an expedition defence to a genuine territorial defence, which can contribute to the deployment of self-propelled brigades to the assistance of NATO partners, but which can also contribute to a credible defence of the kingdom of Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421195002	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you, Mr President. Søren Espersen. And then we reached Aaja Chemnitz Larsen from IA. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421195019	Greenland must be opened up to the outside world, there is no doubt about that. We are citizens of the world and we also want to take part in a global responsibility. I have just come from Alaska and from Karasjok in northern Norway, where I met a large number of our Arctic kinsmen. It was extremely exciting, and here I was confirmed in that we must strengthen our international role in Greenland. We must cooperate with like-minded countries that respect democracy, a rule-based world order and international commitments. The war in Ukraine puts our cooperation to the test, not least in the Arctic, but we also know that the climate crisis cannot wait for the rights of indigenous peoples to wait, and we know that there is a need for economic growth in Greenland, which cannot be slowed down by the war either. That is why we also need to find ways to continue dialogue and efforts in the Arctic, but without Russia. We have to do it bilaterally, and we have to do it between the other seven Arctic states. For Greenland's importance in the world community will continue to increase and it obliges us to act with a high degree of responsibility when developing the Arctic in a sustainable way. Denmark's foreign and security policy strategy almost only mentions the Arctic under security policy. What about the climate diplomacy, which is so obvious in relation to Greenland? Or what about increased common economic diplomacy? These are some questions that I think we also need to ask ourselves. Yes, I think that we are all waiting for the Kingdom's Arctic strategy, and on 1 April 2022 Greenland started its negotiations on a broadly based foreign and security policy for us in Greenland, which must lay the foundations for a common strategy. And it has to be said that it is urgent. I therefore share the impatience that I also hear in this Chamber today. And I heard here recently that India has actually also developed an Arctic strategy and that we are actually some of the only ones in the world who do not have an Arctic strategy. So this underlines the need for us to get into work clothes. In Greenland we are to participate in negotiations on the Arctic and Greenland. Nothing is to be negotiated about us without us. We must have an independent and decisive negotiating position in our own region. Therefore, it is also good that the government has opened the way for Greenlandic and Faroese MPs to participate in the conciliation negotiations on the Arctic. That's right. In Greenland we are role models for indigenous peoples around the world, and we must represent ourselves with clear, self-conscious and enlightened demands, not only for ourselves, but also in solidarity with other peoples in the Arctic, not least indigenous peoples, who make up one eighth of the 4 million who live in the Arctic. Greenland is both part of the Arctic and part of the Nordic Region, and we must take from both regions to help create development in our area. A central focus of foreign policy is trade and business policy. The increased international interest in Greenland must be used to create new free trade agreements, trade opportunities, and in particular help to ensure increased exports of Greenlandic goods, including food products, which contribute to strengthening the economy. In Alaska I could hear that the United States is almost becoming the largest export market for Greenland in relation to the fishing of shrimps, and it is of course interesting how things start to turn around. And 14%. of Greenland's exports have gone to Russia before the war in Ukraine, but we stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the kingdom community. In many ways foreign policy is also about promoting domestic political interests, and in concrete terms we think it is important to focus on Greenland's economy and to replace parts of the block grant with increased trade. Domestic political stability and perseverance are essential for attracting external investment. We must attract investment from both Denmark, the EU and the United States, which are some of the closest allies to Greenland, and Greenland is open to cooperation and trade. Investments must take place in sustainable business development and be based on the visions of Greenland as a self-sustaining energy island. We find this quite interesting, and a great deal of effort is being put into doing what you can in order to increase the use of hydropower in Greenland. It is interesting to see how we can supply ourselves and perhaps also help to export energy forward-looking. Greenland must be a green developing country. It is also important that we develop the digital infrastructure, and not long ago I read that the European Union is showing interest in developing the digital infrastructure in Greenland or in the Arctic. And I think it is super interesting, because it is a hugely important prerequisite for economic growth that we have easier access to the Internet, that it is cheaper than it is today, otherwise it is an obstacle to creating the development we need. It is also important that we strengthen our cooperation with the International Inuit Business Council, which is a new organisation in the Arctic, and that we do what we can to strengthen cooperation with the Arctic Economic Council, to strengthen the Arctic as an attractive region to invest in. Stable and credible management of the country is important in ensuring that confidence is there to invest in Greenlandic society. Greenland is a very central player in the Arctic, and it must reflect our position in the Arctic Council, which we also want to strengthen in the coming years. In the past, I have made a request or a call to look at whether the Nordic countries, which are about to take over the presidency of the Arctic Council, could perhaps come together to have some Nordic values that could be promoted in the Arctic Council; at least I think that makes enormous sense. As part of a major foreign policy role, it is also important that we bear in mind the strengthening of research diplomacy. In the Folketing we have helped to allocate money to Arctic research hub. We have helped secure money for Nasiffik, a foreign and security policy centre in Greenland. And it is important that the competence building in Greenland takes place strategically, so it helps to ensure that we also have more knowledge about foreign and security policy in Greenland, so that it is done on a more enlightened basis. Culture also promotes Greenland and the branding of Greenland. The dissemination of culture should also be part of our foreign policy at home in Greenland, I believe. Culture creates debate, culture creates bridges, and we have a lot to be proud of in relation to Greenlandic culture, which can also be seen as an opportunity to brand Greenland, but also an opportunity to perhaps create an increased interest in Greenland in several different ways. There is no doubt that the Arctic is getting more attention and that there is greater interest in the Arctic, and with that interest there are also increased opportunities for conflict. And at the heart of the policy that Greenland must pursue, it is still gone to maintain low-voltage through constructive cooperation, through diplomacy. Peace is an important prerequisite for the development of Greenlandic society, and maintaining peace and low tension is a fundamental principle for Inuit Ataqatigiit. That is why new military initiatives must also be taken on the basis of a contribution to maintaining low-voltage. And there are many who find that hard to hold onto when we know that there is war in Ukraine, and we are also challenged in the Arctic because Russia is so central part of the Arctic. What we are going to point to in the forthcoming defence settlement negotiations is increased monitoring, and sovereignty enforcement must be developed within the Kingdom community and in cooperation with the other countries in relation to NATO, with the focus on ensuring this low-voltage. In addition to a closer involvement of Greenland in foreign and security policy matters, close and constructive cooperation with Denmark, the Nordic countries, the United States and the European Union must continue in order to ensure a defensive security policy where the objective is precisely to maintain low-voltage. The agreement of principle between the government and the State of Naala to preserve Kangerlussuaq is something we also need to have clarified. It is both at home in Greenland, but it is of course also in Denmark that you have to decide what you really want in terms of preserving Kangerlussuaq, but it is a great wish of many, I know, among others. in Sisimiut, where I've been not so long ago. At the very end I just want to pop a little with the flag of the Greenlandic veterans, which I think we should also bear in mind. There is an association in Greenland, and I know that we have had a new piece of legislation in this area, which I am very, very happy about, but it is also an area on which we have not had much focus. So I would just like to highlight that here at the very end. With those words, I just want to say thank you very much. Qujanaq.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200021	Thank you to Mrs Aaja Chemnitz Larsen. There are no brief comments, so we move on to Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam, the rapporteur for Siumut.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200041	Thank you. Today we are speaking from the platform of foreign policy, and as we are an autonomous part of the realm, it is my firm belief that the voice of the Kalaalit is heard, understood and implemented in all the circumstances relating to the foreign policy messages of the empire. When we talk about foreign policy, we quickly become technical: a contact committee, diplomatic embassies, a handsome heather in a suit, sitting at a round table with many different countries' fine table flags. Too many people will soon seem quite distant, as something that does not have a direct impact on the everyday life of the general family. But suddenly everyone could feel what a difference it makes when a worldwide pandemic arose. Suddenly we could see the effect of diplomacy on international cooperation when war arose in the neighbourhood. Russia's invasion into Ukraine is a terrible war which Siumut strongly condemns. Regardless of the motives, an attack on a sovereign nation cannot be justified in any way. Ukrainian civilians lose their lives every day. Both countries lose soldiers every day; young boys who have had to be soldiers. Ukrainian and Russian parents, siblings, friends lose their loved ones in a completely empty war. Despite the fact that it does not go unnoticed that all war refugees are not always supported on equal terms, it is still very touching to see how neighbouring countries in Europe stand together to help Ukrainian war refugees and to help with what they can, in the hope of ending this cruel war. These days we hear about the importance of having close relations with our neighbouring countries and how important it is to conduct diplomacy. Foreign policy, which can sometimes be felt remotely for people, can suddenly be felt very closely. And it is not only during war that we are reminded of the importance of foreign policy. With the worldwide pandemic, we also saw the importance of globalisation, and we saw how there was cohesion between countries in order to find a vaccine and combat the virus. Because in a globalised world in which we now live, foreign policy is no longer just diplomacy between countries. It's a sudden exchange of knowledge between people, it's history, it's cultural narrative, it's when we make trade with each other, and it's when young people choose to take an education elsewhere in the world to expand the horizon and be formed. My speech today is therefore about the importance of our contact with our neighbouring countries and about Greenland's great desire to be part of the globalised world. In this regard, I would like to tell you about a 19-year-old inuk woman named Nivi. Nivi has chosen to continue training in Greenland's neighbouring country of Canada; a country that also has an Inuit in the country, whose language and culture are very similar to that of Greenland, in the same way as Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are similar. In Canada, Inuit like Nivi can be given the opportunity to have better resources to complete its education, including: Because you want to be free of formal land borders, which have in the past separated the Inuit people in the Arctic. All she needed was proof that she's inuk. Yet there was great confusion in Greenland about who actually has the authority to declare Nivi as inuk. In the fact that all Greenlanders automatically have Danish citizenship, the Canadian authorities could not demonstrate that Nivi should be inuk, since Greenlanders are Danish on paper. That is why we also have a specific problem where foreign policy, which for 300 years has been governed in and by Denmark, does not always offer the same opportunities to Greenlandic inuit that wants to interact with the globalised world and with neighbouring countries such as Canada; Canada, which is just 16 km away from Greenland, which corresponds to the total length of the Øresund Bridge. Nevertheless, we have not ensured better diplomatic ties for inuit from both sides to have the same opportunities. That is why I also chose to put a committee question to the Prime Minister, who was subsequently also forwarded to the Foreign Minister, in order to clarify who or which authority has just the power to declare people like Nivi and all other Inuit in the Danish kingdom as being inuk. Denmark has for several hundred years built and established good, solid networks for countries around the world, and especially for Denmark's neighbouring countries, i.e. to countries in Europe and the Nordic countries. Freedom of movement has been created, opportunities to work and training opportunities for other Scandinavians between countries. When Greenland is 3,500 km away from Denmark, and when we have an Inuit-aleut language, we have a different geography and demography, it is no less than obvious that we are also taking advantage of the same opportunities that you Scandinavians have also taken advantage of when you created the Nordic co-operation because you are a neighbouring country. Naalaksuisut can speak about foreign affairs when it comes specifically to taken-over areas, but it still requires to this day that it is not contrary to government policy. In other words, it is about Denmark giving the green light for Greenland to go out and negotiate with other countries. I can talk about things I have mentioned before, the establishment of interparliamentary parliamentary councils in the Kingdom, the strengthening of the Contact Committee, full foreign policy competence for Greenland, all that is still relevant, but I thought it was time to bring this issue up, the time for us, Kalallit inuit, to have the same opportunities to interact and make relationships with our neighbouring countries as you have with your kinsmen. In 2022, the final decision on foreign policy room for manoeuvre we have in Greenland, despite autonomy, is still something that should not go against Denmark's policy, and that is why I would like to urge that a single kingdom also support Greenland in creating these relations with neighbouring countries, that the Greenlandic Inuit people should have the same opportunities to create these close relations with other inuits in order to combat these border barriers and create greater knowledge development, education and training with each other. Qujanaq.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200729	Thank you. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200732	I am genuinely interested in the history of Nivi, and I fully agree that we must be much better at making exchanges within the Kingdom community. So we are in complete agreement with that. To make sure I understand the problem correctly, I just want to ask about the very fine story about Nivi who was going to study in Canada: Isn't it true that it is Denmark that pays for her education while she is training in Canada? I guess it is, huh? It is quite true that we need to be better at accepting Greenlandic students in Denmark. Is it not true that Greenlandic students are admitted to Danish universities with a lower average than that demanded by Danish students and that they are provided with cheap housing in Denmark and receive full su?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200814	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200815	It's a little bit to dispute the truth if you can put it that way. But if we go back to Nivi, it is quite important to point out that Nivi pays for his education in Canada because you do not have the same conditions. This is precisely why Inuit in Canada has been given some financial and resource scope so that Inuits in the Arctic can easily take an education so that one can take an education even if one's parents have not taken an education and even if one's grandparents never took an education. But Nivi doesn't have the same options, because there's no one to prove that she's inuk, even if she is. That is a bit where we stand now that we have a concrete example of strengthening foreign policy in some of these areas.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200909	Sir. Karsten Hønge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200910	It ended in such a major ethnic analysis. That's not really what I was so interested in. I think it would be fantastic if we could have even better cooperation in the field of education. But it is surely true that Nivi does not pay for all of his education and all the costs associated with taking it in Canada. It will be paid by Denmark, as I understand it. Something else is that I am completely in favour of Greenlandic students being admitted with a lower average than Danish students in Denmark, but not with a reference to the fact that they have had some particular difficulties. We do not say that children born of cash benefit recipients in Denmark are admitted to universities with a lower average. So we do not do so, although they may well have some difficulties. But I would like the rapporteur to confirm that we actually have the kindness that means that you are actually admitted on a lower average, that you are provided with cheap accommodation and that you receive full payment from Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200953	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421200954	First of all, there is no provision for cheap accommodation. That is incorrect. Secondly, it is also the case that you only have one chance once in your life to take an education, but you might never have the opportunity to take it, even if you have the same citizenship, if it can be said that way. But it is also because our history is taken into account. It is taken into account that there are very many who do not have parents and grandparents who have taken an education. We do not have exactly the same conditions. And it's just to strengthen this. As far as Nivi is concerned, education is an area that has been repatriated, as I was, in a sense, also mentioned in my speech. It is from this that support is given, not from the Danish state. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421201039	Thank you to Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam and we have reached Mr Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam. Edmund Joensen from Sambandsflockkurin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421201053	Thank you for the floor, and thank you to the Foreign Minister for the statement on the foreign and security policy strategy. The world is on fire, Europe is at war. Who would have thought that by 2022 we would see war on European soil? The fact that a free and democratic country should be invaded by the world's largest country, which is also a nuclear power, is frightening. The traditional warfare that Russia is currently conducting in Ukraine is horrendous, it is undoubtedly the worst form of war in which cities are being bombed and how many people, military personnel as well as innocent people are losing their lives. Unfortunately, we have seen far too much of this in the last two months since Russia invaded Ukraine. From Ukraine I will now move home again. Indeed, I would like to focus on the new threats facing the Kingdom, which are also described in the statement on the foreign and security policy strategy, the kind of threats that are equally dangerous to our society, but where human life is not directly at stake, the kind of threats that cannot be seen with the naked eye but that are taking place around us and that are being prevented almost on a daily basis, namely cyber and hybrid threats. The spyage threats are greater than ever, hacker attacks are more pronounced, and as one of the world's most digitized countries Denmark is particularly exposed, as the statement shows. But one cannot say Denmark without also saying the Kingdom Community, and I feel convinced that the Faroe Islands and Greenland as part of the Arctic area are also exposed to their part of cyber threats and attacks • attacks, which can be difficult to identify and protect themselves against due to the changing and sometimes uncontrollable nature, and not everything can be discussed here in the Parliament Hall, especially when it comes to the security of our Kingdom Community. I am convinced that there is a lot going on in both the government and the various security services that we do not know about, and I hope that the attention paid to cyber threats and attacks against the northern parts of the kingdom community is as great as it is in Denmark. Let me therefore breathe a thought now that the threat of cyberattacks is as great as we are constantly reminded of: could it then be imagined to strengthen cybersecurity in the Faroe Islands? For basically, we have both Faroese and Danish responsibilities in the Faroe Islands to be protected. Of course, I do not know how best to handle this strengthening. There are professionals who have better control than I do, but I know that it is important to make a problem visible before considering how to solve it, and I hope that attention to these new potential threats is also great in the Faroe Islands. It is of the utmost importance that people in the Faroe Islands are prepared to understand these threats and attacks when they arrive. This applies not only to the security of the Faroe Islands, but also to the security of the whole Kingdom community. I will end by saying a sentence which I have said many times before. Our kingdom community is a unique construction that many parts of the world envy us, but we must be careful not to create the slightest vulnerability in the Kingdom community that can quickly be intercepted and exploited by foreign powers that do not want us well. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421201625	Thank you, sir. Edmund Joensen. There are no brief comments, so we have now reached the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421201638	Thank you for the floor, and thank you to those who have given good input to the government's new foreign and security policy strategy. I should like to begin by regretting the fact that I had to postpone the debate on the report on two occasions, as several people also noted. Today's debate is, of course, marked by the war in Ukraine, Putin's unprecedented and unprovoked war of aggression, and the consequences in both the short and the long term for Denmark. When we launched the strategy back at the end of January, Russian troops had already marched along Ukraine's border, but with Russia's invasion on 24 February everything was changed, as several have pointed out, and yet it is as if the war in all its horror has highlighted critical elements in our strategic starting point and priorities: that the world in which we live has become more raw and more unpredictable, and that geopolitics is back with a struggle between democracy and autocracy also here in Europe. Originally, we should have had this debate on the back of a strategy launch in August 2021. We had to postpone it because of the Afghanistan evacuation. The discharge turned into a good debate over the autumn and winter. It was an important reflection process in relation to the many different aspects of Danish foreign and security policy and the crises and challenges that Denmark faces even though we could not foresee that only six months later we would face the most serious security crisis in Europe since the Second World War. I would like to thank the foreign policy rapporteurs for having also been involved in the process towards the final creation of the strategy. The crises and challenges of the world order that we built up have come to stay. This clearly shows that we are in the midst of a global battle of values that pushes Danish core interests. Ukraine and other Eastern Partnership countries are currently fighting an important fight for democracy and freedom. That fight is more important than ever, and it is very much about security and stability, but also about the fundamental values on which our society is based, and that is why the war in Ukraine is not just an expression of a regional conflict, but reflects a greater clash between democracies and autocracy, and here is Putin's enemy number one. It is a global competition for influence and values and for the nature of international cooperation and our common ground rules, and we have shown that we are ready to take that fight. Denmark has shown our determination and our unity with the EU, NATO allies and partners, and that a strong West is ready to defend our common values. The situation thus puts a thick line under the importance of the direction marks given by the government's foreign and security policy strategy. We have been very clear in our line: no less, but more Danish commitment; no less, but more responsibility; we must stand firm on our values; we must be at the core of binding communities, first and foremost the EU, NATO and the UN. Denmark must take responsibility for our common security. The government and the parties behind the national compromise agree on this. We agree on a significant historical boost to our defences. We agree that we must live up to the two per cent objective of NATO and that we must get rid of the defence reserve. Time calls for a gear shift. We must enter fully into the EU's security and defence policy cooperation. So let me briefly, and it will be very brief, because we have a good debate, I think, sum up some significant cuts in the five main points of the strategy: security, climate, integration, economic diplomacy and value diplomacy, and first a few comments on the diplomacy of values. The strategy, as several have noted, introduces a value-policy compass, which Mr. Søren Søndergaard also mentioned. Values and value policy are drawn more clearly across the different areas and cross Danish foreign policy. I would like to make it clear that we are fully aware that we do not make an easy choice when we choose to draw Danish foreign policy in a value-based direction. And everyone in this Chamber knows what I am thinking of here. We must not end up in a false contradiction between values and interests. We must and must have both parts in the equation. The vast majority of times we are most effective when we are together with allies, and that is also quite clear in the current crisis. Denmark must be at the heart of the European Union and work for close transatlantic cooperation because we believe that a strong Europe gives us a strong West. Allow me to take a closer look at the relationship and role-union between the European Union and the United States, which are also the subject of many discussions, with an EU that strengthens its defence and security policy profile and with a Danish referendum on the abolition of the defence reserve. The United States is more oriented towards China, towards the Indo-Pacific region. They must, and this is not bad for Denmark or for Europe. On the contrary, we are fully in line with the United States when it comes to our Chinese policy and the global value struggle that is taking place here. I was last year in Indonesia and Japan, where I participated in a number of good dialogues on, among others. the work on peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, with increased geopolitical competition. At the same time, however, the United States is deeply committed to European security. We are also seeing this right now, and together with Europe, with partners and allies, the United States has made transatlantic cohesion, NATO cooperation and the defence of the transatlantic European security order one hundred percent firm vis-à-vis Russia. We are negotiating with the United States a new bilateral defence agreement. We are now in the process of doing so. This confirms our close cooperation on Danish and European security. But we also believe that we in Europe must take greater responsibility for our own security. Mr. Martin Lidegaard mentioned at the beginning that we have a greater security policy commitment in Europe, in line with the Americans, who have long been calling for it. We must therefore make a commitment here, and Denmark must have an active and committed role in this. We must participate fully and therefore the time has come to abolish the defence reserve. Just a word about the security diplomacy, which is also included here: we are working for a safer world that provides security for Denmark and security for the Danes, and to protect our democracy from external pressures. There is so much reason for this. It is also about the defence and deterrent profile that I have mentioned, and Denmark is sending a very clear signal in this connection. Denmark is a nuclear alliance in NATO and we contribute substantially to security in the Baltic Sea and the Baltic. In fact, with the envoy of up to a thousand soldiers we are now engaged in, we have not had major operations outside Denmark, apart from Afghanistan, and that is really significant. Just as we on the Danish side were at the forefront when the Baltic countries, Poland and other countries wanted to become part of the security community that NATO is, we are also at the forefront when there are threats to our security. This also applies to new threats. Several have mentioned them: cyberattacks, espionage and influence campaigns. Here, in particular, we have good tools, including in the area of EU cooperation. Sir. Karsten Hønge mentioned it. Denmark has taken initiatives, including: with Tech for Democracy, where we also want the tech giants, civil society and governments together to protect our democratic values from those who try to destroy them from the outside and from the inside. To conclude this with security policy, I would like to highlight our UN commitment. This is an absolutely crucial battleground for value policy, as we are now seeing with the Ukraine crisis. Here, together with all those who support a rule-based cooperation, Denmark must take the lead. Denmark has also announced its candidacy to the UN Security Council in 2025-26. Just a few words about the climate diplomacy: the reason why I want to emphasise this is that it is a crisis that we notice, as several of you note, that we are in the middle of and that we must not fail to do anything about. This is a crisis which is a climate crisis for the whole world, but it is also a crisis if democracies do not take the lead in the fight to deliver on the Paris Agreement and deliver a climate that we can be familiar to future generations. So this is also a completely central area of foreign policy to focus on. It is strong and it has never stood as strong in Danish foreign policy as it is now. Denmark as a green forerunner and the fact that energy has become security policy and climate policy are inextricably linked, not least because, as several of us have mentioned, we are all too dependent on gas, oil and coal from Russia and elsewhere in the world. It is also just to say that Europe is also a solution here. There were others who mentioned it, and I think that Mr. Søren Søndergaard again referred to the concept of strategic autonomy in Europe and Denmark. In order to be able to do so, and therefore also to have an opportunity to avoid dependence on others who can limit our actions, we must have strong communities and the European Community is absolutely crucial. It is also an appeal to Enhedslisten to help lift this, because Denmark cannot only ensure strategic autonomy. We can do that with others, and that is what makes us strong, especially when it is a community based on common values of the rule of law and democracy and the defence of the values enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. For reasons of time, I do not want to go too deep into migration diplomacy here, but it is also essential that we have a fairer, humane and realistic migration policy that we have mentioned. Then there is economic diplomacy, and I would just like to say a few words about that, also because it has not filled so much, but it is important. For we must address some of the basic reasons why this world is constantly struggling with conflicts, with what is causing the flow of refugees, and with what makes societies collapse or makes them develop in the wrong direction, then we must also focus on economic diplomacy. Inequality in our society is a source of instability, and therefore, just to emphasise it, we also have quite a focus on the triple bottom line in relation to economic diplomacy, so that we must of course both help our companies create jobs in Denmark, but also contribute to the green transition, and not least, with Danish solutions, among other things. strengthen and focus on good working conditions and lift the conventions that help regulate it, including in our trade policy. That is absolutely crucial. Then several people have mentioned the strengthening of Danish diplomacy. It is true that the government's foreign and security policy strategy is based on a fundamental review of Danish diplomacy, which was carried out in 2021. Here the government decided to cancel the re-priority contribution for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and we have actually done so in all the years we have been in government, 4 years if you count from 2020 up to and including 2023. Along with a large number of re-priorities, therefore, this means that in the years to come we will be faced with an overall addition of more than 40 years' work at home and at home and a strengthening of 16 representations, including, in particular, Mrs Annette Lind also mentioned NATO, the European Union, the United Nations, in other words, the multilateral is what needs to be strengthened where we also have to take part in the fight here. So with the strategy we have set a clear line for Denmark, where we take responsibility. We don't sit back and let the big guys solve the world's problems. We take responsibility ourselves. I would also like to thank Mrs Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam, and also Mr Høegh-Dam. Edmund Joensen for the perspectives they bring here. I think there is a value in the fact that we, as small nations, as small countries, stand together and defend the values that I have spoken about here. That is absolutely crucial. Sir. Edmund Joensen concluded so elegantly by saying it so precisely that if we are threatened from the outside, we stand together as small nations about our sovereignty, about our integrity, about our values. And, yes, from day one, the government has set up a cooperation in which we are equally inclusive of the common challenges of the Kingdom community, and we intend to continue to do so. A number of requests were made, including: Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen is what happens to the Arctic strategy for the kingdom. We know that there has been a change of government in Greenland, and I think it is quite natural that in the spirit of cooperation we have, we respect the fact that the different parts of the kingdom also have the opportunity to do their jobs and take up the discussion before we conclude and get a new strategy. In fact, I think the process is an important part of getting a proper strategy. And it is not the case that because we do not have a strategy that has yet been adopted, we do not have an Arctic policy. We showed this by May last year when we had a meeting of the Arctic Council, where we, of course, together participated and presented the views of the Kingdom, both with the participation of myself, of course, but also of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. However, we are working hard on this, and I welcome everything we can do to strengthen our cooperation, both between governments, but also between parliaments, what several people have pointed out is really, really important here. So just two last remarks for me: I think that today's debate also shows that the values that we are talking about, and which we are also talking about in the strategy, we may have taken everything, too much for years, that is self-criticism. We, who were young there and who have a political commitment defined by the end of the Cold War with the fall of the Wall in November 1989 and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, hoped, believed and insisted that now it was a peaceful and democratic Europe that had grown out of it. It has to be said that what happened to 24 February this year, but also before that in 2008 in Georgia, in 2014 with Crimea and East Ukraine, just shows that the world is brutal and that we must not take our values for granted. We have to fight for them every day, because if we don't, we're gonna start losing them. I am proud of the will, which I think there is, also in the Danish people, to take responsibility in this situation. I also think it must be said, when you look at the Ukrainians, that they must be a model for all of us. They stand up and are ready to fight to the death for their own country, for the values they believe in, and they do not submit to Putin and his dictatorial thoughts. I really think that's impressive. The second thing I want to say is that freedom has a price • it has a price. That is why we must also increase our defence costs. We must, of course, be fully involved in European cooperation in the field of security and defence. We must take responsibility, and we must take that price. But I can promise you that the price of not doing anything or doing too little will be much higher, and the conscience that we will bring to future generations will not be good if we cannot stand up for our freedom today. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203239	Thank you to the Secretary of State. There are a few brief comments. First, it's from sir. Michael Aastrup Jensen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203244	Thank you, Minister. One of the areas that the Minister did not address safely due to time constraints was the question of the Islamic State in the Middle East and, above all, what we are doing to combat them. On the left side, we clearly indicate that we very, very much want the government to cooperate with us other parties and simply make a significant contribution! It may be that the Minister can then come up with other solutions, but I do not see how we can ensure that this area becomes stable and therefore more secure if we do not have the Kurds to take on the bulk of the responsibility. That is why we are obliged, even if it is geopolitically upset water, to go in more strongly and support the Kurds. Does the Minister agree with that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203338	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203339	Yeah, basically. And I just want to say that we have to remember what the situation was if we just don't go back a decade. There the Islamic State controlled that which corresponds to a geographical area the size of Britain, with their most disgusting, terrible, medieval Islamist ideology, which was a disgrace to this world. That is why it is right that we should support everything we can to prevent those forces coming back and fighting them with the whole palette of funds, including military means, as has also been discussed in this debate. I myself take part here in May in the coalition of countries from both Europe, North America and so on, but also from Africa and the Middle East, against ISIL and against terrorist groups in general. And that coalition has never been greater, and it has never been stronger, but we must not forget that it is important for our own security that we continue that fight, including with support for, for example, North-East Syria and Iraq to bring stability there. It has also just adopted a new programme for this purpose.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203445	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203446	And we have been there all the way in relation to the support that exists for the Kurdish allies, but we also need more, we have to say, concrete help, other than just programme support, humanitarian aid, etc. So we are also talking about strengthening the military capabilities of the Kurdish forces that ensure the fight against the Islamic State on earth. And that's what I'm actually trying to ask the Minister. Is the Minister prepared that this is also one of the areas we are discussing? At any rate, I can say from the Left that we are more than ready to discuss with the government. So this is a show of hands... no, it's called handshake. I've revealed that I'm a baby's dad, so this is late at night. But this is a helping hand on the left side.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203529	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203530	Thank you. As another child parent, I would also like to say that it is late in the evening. I look forward to further discussion and discussion, not least in the area of foreign policy. We have delivered, as we know, a large package of support to North-East Syria in various ways as well. We support the fight against Islamic State in various ways. And the elements of that we are discussing in the right forum.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203555	The next brief remark is to Mr. Karsten Hønge. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203557	After all, the Social Democratic Foreign Affairs rapporteur chose in the debate to talk consistently about the subject when the government's cuts in development aid were made, which is why I am going to take it up again. When the Minister says in his speech that the strategy is based on the fundamental values on which our society is based, I would just like to ask: where on earth has the Minister found the value in Denmark that the world's poorest should pay for Europe's challenges?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203639	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203640	Thank you. Just to knock a stake through the misunderstandings, I would like to say that the government has not cut back on development aid. Denmark is one of the few countries that delivers 0.7 per cent. of our contribution to development aid and has been doing so for many decades, and it has been important for the government to ensure that the re-priorities that have taken place in terms of helping refugees from Ukraine are done in the most gentle way. For example, we have completely released our neighbourhood programme and we have released the humanitarian framework, but it is true that we have re-priority some funds to help refugees. These are funds that went to fragile states, neighbourhoods and migration, but one can safely say that with the war that is in the midst of Europe there is a need to help, even in the middle of Europe, and that is why we have chosen to do so.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203725	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203726	Why don't you stick to your politics? Don't make such a news talk about no, it's not a cut, it's a re-priority. The result is the same. It is, of course, that the poorest in the world are being allowed to pay for the challenges that exist in Europe. So defend it instead of covering it in a fog talk about that it is not a cut, but that it is almost just a re-priority. The result for the world's poorest is at least the same; it is a reduction. And then you can choose to use such a good old-fashioned expression that most young people today do not know: there you fix for blacksmith.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203756	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203756-2	It was the claim that the government cut down on our development aid that led me to say that no, we give 0.7 per cent. of development aid. That's the way it is. However, I would like to stress that we have a very special situation, and it is true that some of the money we spend the first year helping refugees can then be counted as development aid. We will have huge challenges with that task, and it is important that we resolve it. I'm glad we're in this together. I am proud of Danish society and that we can also take this task on us, and we will continue to provide development aid, also in the coming years.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203832	The next brief remark is to Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203836	I've noticed several times when we're talking about these values and of course we have to go for the values that sometimes it can also be so a little difficult for people to put it into practice, you might say. Another value, for example, is. that, if we look into the self-government law, it says that cooperation between Greenland and Denmark in relation to governments must also be carried out on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and that is also a value. However, I would like to hear from the Minister whether he could give some words about how we are doing this in practice in order to create cooperation based on equality and respect.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203919	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421203920	Thank you to Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam. It has been my approach as Foreign Minister and the government's approach from day one that in the Kingdom community we have respectful, equal, inclusive cooperation on the things we share, qua that we are a kingdom community. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, that in the world we are in, with the pressure that is against us, against the values we stand for, among other things. the values which Mrs Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam so vividly described about self-determination, sovereignty, the fact that we as people can live freely, must work together on them. That is my approach to it, of course within what is the framework of our Kingdom community, and we will continue to do so, and in concrete terms I myself have given priority to cooperation both with Greenland and the Faroe Islands by being involved several times. Now there have been various representatives in the field of foreign affairs, Naalakkersuisoq, and there has also been a new one, and I will look forward to having a meeting with the person concerned tomorrow. I look forward to that very much.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204023	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204025	Thank you for your answer. One of the things in which we are also united was, among other things, the fact that we are in the same position. with the Ukraine crisis, where Greenland, despite the fact that we are not members of the European Union, also agreed to EU sanctions because of the common value base we have. But one of the other things is also the climate, and I have noticed that the minister was not alone in saying that the cold war that you grew up in has also had an impact on how you had hoped to prevent some of these existential crises. But one of the crises that we are also experiencing as young people in the world is the climate crisis, which we see as as as powerful as a war, because we see it as an existential crisis in which we are really so worried about our future. What about our cooperation?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204117	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204118	This is a crucially important point, and that is why we also appointed the first climate ambassador when we arrived as a government, and we have made 15 climate front posts in the world and have an ambition to create green strategic partnerships with the largest economies that destroy the globe with the emissions of CO2 We also have the whole focus on getting Danish green companies out on our export markets to contribute there, and we also do so in close cooperation with Greenland, and we also have a good dialogue here. And if there's any place you feel climate change, it's in the Arctic.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204153	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mr. Søren Søndergaard. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204156	Thank you. I fully agree with the Minister that the challenges we face come up with a price, and that will be a great price. The question then is how to spend the money that needs to be invested. Maybe we don't quite agree on that. But I have another question for the Minister. Fortunately, we have had a very broad consensus on condemning Russia's invasion, demanding the withdrawal of troops and supporting the Ukrainian people's right to self-determination. But we have also seen that we are now experiencing a nuclear threat or an increased talk about the use of nuclear weapons, which we had never imagined, hopefully, would come to light again. That is why I would just like to ask the Foreign Minister whether he thinks that what we have here, written before the latest developments, is adequate or whether there is a basis for some new initiatives in this area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204302	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204304	Thank you for the question. There are two answers to that. First of all, it is a strategy in which we set a compass, as Mr. Søren Søndergaard mentioned this, so it is something about values, and we do not need to remind each other that the crises are currently queuing a corona crisis, Afghanistan, and now we have a war on European soil that we have not seen like since World War II and it is important that we navigate with the compass. That said, there is, secondly, disarmament policy and it is an important part of what we want and what the government wants, and it also says in the strategy that it is an important part of creating a more peaceful and safer world. So we want to cultivate that and now I can say it as it is: when I came to as Foreign Minister, there was really no work left on that front, sorry to those who are my predecessors, but that was the truth, and now we have given priority to disarmament work, and I think that only becomes more important. We should also like to include China in this, in addition to Russia and other countries, so that we can create a safer world, control the weapons, stop the proliferation, not least of nuclear weapons, as Mr. Søren Søndergaard has mentioned this.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204407	Here's the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204409	Thank you for that answer. Then I just want to hear what these contexts will be, where the Folketing will have a discussion of it. So, is it something where the government will present a statement, or is it something where we should call for a question debate? Will it be in the nickname? Where will it be? What is like the organisational framework? Because hardly many people believe that Russia, regardless of Putin's wishes, has a capacity for conventional military attacking all the countries of Europe. It doesn't exist. But he's got a nuclear threat, and it's serious, isn't it? And you can hear how that rhetoric really gets turned up. So where's the frame where we can discuss these things?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204448	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204450	I think that is quite natural in the Parliamentary Chamber, but of course also in the Foreign Policy Name and elsewhere. I can say that the review conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty will hopefully be this summer, I think the next time is, and it is important that we participate and are active in putting pressure on all the parties here. It is also important, and we support this, that there is a strategic dialogue between the countries that are nuclear powers to ensure non-proliferation, but also to avoid the use of nuclear weapons. In other words, we really want a world without nuclear weapons and an important part of, for example, a world without nuclear weapons. NATO cooperation is indeed arms control and non-proliferation, it is work for control and transparency, and we will continue to do so. However, let us take up the discussions in this Chamber, but also like to take up the issue of foreign policy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204540	Thank you very much to the Secretary of State. There are no more brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204548	The debate is open. The first rapporteur is Mrs Annette Lind from the Socialists. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421204606	Thank you for that, President. In this debate we are going to discuss and talk about selected international organisations such as the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Baltic Sea Council. We have been discussing this for many years, and sometimes we have had the debates together, and sometimes we have had them separately. This year we'll take them together. I would like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his statement to Parliament here. I would also like to do it a little more overall than I have done in the past. What has stood in the sign of the past year is Covid-19, and then it is clear that Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine on 24 February has now completely cleared the table and, of course, has also influenced the work of both the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Council of Baltic States. I think all of this will be done for some time to come. I look forward to the annual opportunity to discuss Denmark's commitment to a number of very important international organisations and reflect on the year that has passed and the work that lies ahead of us, although this is in the shadow of a very, very serious, sad and worrying situation for security in Europe. Because we are living at a time when there is again war on European soil. I do not think that any of us could imagine this last year when we discussed the cooperation of the three organizations. It's hard to comprehend. Europe is facing the greatest security policy crisis we have seen since the Cold War. It is a rule-based international cooperation that we have been building up laboriously since the Second World War, and it is seriously under threat. Putin's attack hits Ukraine first, but ultimately, yes, it hits all of us. On the Danish side, we have worked to secure the toughest possible sanctions against Russia, and we have isolated Russia in all international forums. This also applies to the three organisations we are discussing here today. We have pressed for Russian violations of international law and human rights in Ukraine to be documented and prosecuted, because Putin must be held accountable for its brutal acts. We actually talked about that yesterday when we talked about eco-mortage and the criminal court. The only bright spot in this serious crisis situation in which Denmark and Europe find themselves is the strong and unbreakable European and transnational cohesion. Together with our allies, we are clearly opposed to Putin in both words and deeds and have introduced historically tough common sanctions. We have stood shoulder to shoulder in Europe and in the West and given our full support to Ukraine. This applies to military, economic, humanitarian and, above all, to the many Ukrainian refugees. Both the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the Baltic Sea Council have distanced themselves very clearly from Russia, as has been done both in the European Union and in the United Nations. And it is absolutely essential that Western democracies stand together in the future and speak out clearly. Putin wants to tear us apart, and he must never succeed in doing so. As far as the Council of Europe is concerned, we have excluded Russia, as all other Member States have also supported. In fact, it already happened on 25 February, the day after Ukraine was invaded. Although some of the countries have supported Russia in the past, an exclusion has been supported. Putin has in many ways violated the Council of Europe's fundamental values of democracy and human rights, and that is what we cannot accept. Unfortunately, there are also several countries within Europe where the development of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and so on. has gone the wrong way. The Council of Europe and the Court of Human Rights continue to play an important role here. With both the Council and the Court, it also needs modernisation, revision and efficiency. And Denmark must continue to push this forward. In relation to the Baltic Sea Council, Russia has also been suspended from participating there. For us in Denmark and the other Member States, the Council remains an important forum for regional dialogue and cooperation in the Baltic region. It is therefore essential that Russia should not have the opportunity to obstruct good cooperation. As far as the OSCE is concerned, it is primarily intended to ensure dialogue, including in the area of conflict management. OSCE cooperation with Russia has been reduced to an absolute minimum. It is clear that the invasion of Ukraine has basically challenged the OSCE's objective of security dialogue and conflict prevention. However, even before the war broke out on 24 February, Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and efforts to uphold our common principles have been at the top of the OSCE agenda. In other words, cooperation has been challenged for a very long time and has now become even more difficult. Nevertheless, the OSCE has an important role to play and is a cornerstone of our common European security architecture. Organisations have a comprehensive toolbox, which we must use in every possible way to promote stability in Europe and our neighbourhoods. So, despite the fact that the OSCE is a unique and important forum to promote dialogue and cooperation, it is clear that the OSCE is a unique and important forum because of the major challenges in the field of security. In a situation of war on European soil, it is more important than ever that we maintain dialogue, including between the warring parties. Unfortunately, however, until now Putin has not wanted to go down the path of dialogue. The world has changed dramatically since February 24th. We have now said this incredibly many times here from the platform. More than ever, we need to move together with our allies and fight for everything we believe in and everything we love and to uphold common ground rules. And that is what we do in NATO and in the European Union, but also in all other international fora where Denmark plays an active, constructive role. On the Danish side, we must continue to engage and do what we can to promote our values, interests and priorities through the cooperation of these three organisations. Given the serious security situation in which Denmark and Europe find themselves, the importance of diplomatic work can hardly be emphasised enough. And then I just hope that the world looks a little brighter when we have this debate next year again. We must believe and fight for that. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421205305	Thank you very much to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next speaker is Mr. Michael Aastrup Jensen from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421205318	Thank you. It is true that I, and I cannot understand it myself, have been a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for 15 years now. I am counting on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give the cake and for the last two years to be chairman of the Council of Europe Monitoring Committee, so much of my speech will of course be on that basis, precisely because it is there that I sit on a daily basis. But before we get there, I also think it is important to stick to the fact that, in relation to the Baltic Council, it is the position of the Left that it was right to suspend Russia's membership, but at the same time it is also the case that, when a new day comes, hopefully, it is a council that we should relaunch so that its importance can grow and so that there is also a body for an area which, no matter how we turn and turn it, could potentially become a very, very hot high-voltage area very quickly. So we want to do that. As far as the OSCE is concerned, we cannot exaggerate its importance, because it is a very, very important organisation. I myself, years ago, have had the opportunity to sit in the parliamentary part, and at least I fully agree that we must ensure that the OSCE has the necessary instruments for, when peace is hopefully achieved, for them to be able to make a similar mission in Ukraine, as they have done in the past, and as they do elsewhere. Then to the Council of Europe. If I were a worse person than what I am, I could start by saying what I said. Because for many of the 15 years I have been a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I have repeatedly said that Russia cannot be trusted, that Russia is an aggressive state and that Russia should not be a member of the Council of Europe and, at least, should be severely sanctioned. I was, in fact, the initiator of the sanctions imposed on Russia following the annexation of Crimea, for which fortunately there was a majority in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. I was the instigator of this, but it was at the same time shameful to see that years later there was a majority who thought that we should remove the sanctions and who said that it may be that we get through with diplomacy towards Russia and that we should perhaps remove all the sanctions and hope for some miracle. So what did they do? A majority in the Parliamentary Assembly removed the sanctions relatively recently because they thought: now there is hope. But excuse me, what kind of hope is that? What happened? What happened was exactly what we had all been talking about, namely that Russia cannot be trusted and that Russia understands only one thing, and it is hard to deal with hard • also diplomatically. That is why I hope that there are a lot of people sitting with red ears, because we received lots of warnings from our Baltic friends and from the other countries of Europe who had felt how and how Putin's aggressiveness had already resulted in the occupation of parts of three European countries. It was from our Georgian friends, our friends from Moldova and, of course, from our Ukrainian friends. I just have to admit that some of what is at least my lesson in relation to the Council of Europe is that the Council of Europe must be a body that is not a mini-UN, where all countries can be members and where there must also be minimum rights in those countries. Fortunately, we never allowed Belarus to go from trial membership to full membership, as in never, let Russia come back before Russia is a democracy. I also hope that the government will respond today, that is to say that Russia must of course not rejoin the Council of Europe until Russia is a democracy. That is certainly the clear position of the Left. In relation to the Council of Europe, we must also say clearly that, in addition to the very terrible war in Ukraine, there is enough to address, namely the whole issue of the Court of Human Rights. I think that we are all really, really happy with the idea of the court and, above all, happy with the hard work that the judges are doing, including the Danish judge. However, it is important to stick to what is the Copenhagen Declaration as a whole and to ensure that the Court continues its reform work. That is why we in the Left are very curious to see what Britain is getting through in relation to the analysis work started by the British Government on how and how to demarcate the European Court of Human Rights from what should be British legislation. That is why one of my questions to the Danish Government is this: have you reached out to the British Government and the analysis work they have started with there? Then we can cling to it, and if Britain finds a golden middle ground, we can adopt the approach in Denmark, where we recognise both the European Court of Human Rights and the whole idea that there are minimum rights for European citizens, but at the same time ensure that we have the policy that the majority of the Folketing wants in the areas that have now been in place, we must say fair discussion over a long period of time. That is my question. Then I will conclude with something that I think is really, really important, and there I actually think I am speaking on behalf of those of us who sit in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, some of whom are in any case present, and that is to thank for the cooperation with the Danish representation in Strasbourg. It is probably not always easy to sit there, but I have now had a collaboration with changing ambassadors, and I think that cooperation is excellent even when there is a red government, it is a really, really sensible cooperation. So thank you very much for your cooperation with the Danish representation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210016	Thank you very much to the rapporteur of the Left. Sir. Søren Søndergaard for a brief comment. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210026	Thank you for your speech, which I broadly agreed with. There is one thing I do not fully understand about the position of the Left, and that is the perception of the relationship between the Court of Human Rights and what is decided in the national parliaments. I have to explain why I do not understand it: you agree to a convention, you even help to choose the judges, you have a democratic influence on who has been elected judges, so it is quite unique, it is almost American and what you then give in return is that you respect the judgments that are coming, precisely to ensure that if something is passed in the national parliaments that goes against what you have originally committed to and the minimum rights that you are applying to, then you are maintained on what you have subscribed to. Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210128	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210129	Yes, and what I was actually trying to say was that I recognise that there must be minimum rights when you are a European citizen. I think it's really, really important that there is. However, the whole discussion I recognise is a discussion, and I also tried to clarify this in my speech, which is where the balance is between what the European Court of Human Rights should take care of and what the national parliaments should take care of. This can quickly become a discussion, just as it is, of course, a discussion with the European Union, what they need to deal with in relation to the national parliaments. The only thing I actually asked for, sir. Søren Søndergaard, was not that we should copy and immediately take over etc. from Britain, but it was that we had to work together with Britain in the analysis work that is there, and then we'll see what they're going to find out. I don't know what they're gonna find out. It may be that they find it completely impossible, because it will be a breach of the Convention or anything else, and then we are against it. Then we are violently opposed to it. We support the Convention. But I do not know, and that is why I want to link myself to the analysis work that is there. It's my only wish.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210227	Here you go, sir. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210229	More than that, however, is the division of labour between the European Court of Human Rights, on the one hand, and the national parliaments, on the other, the division of labour between the Court of Human Rights and the national courts on the other. Because we do have a need, so to speak, to set limits on politics. I know they say no-one and no-one next to the Parliamentary Assembly, but I remember that this Parliament has also been intervened by the legislature, so I suppose there must be limits.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210304	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210305	Of course the necessary balance needs to be struck, and it is therefore only a very sincere wish on my part that we should simply look at whether a solution can be found. I myself remember too well that it was not so long ago when we discussed the Copenhagen Declaration. Here, too, we tried to find all sorts of solutions and we could not really find them. So I am glad to acknowledge that it is uphill and I say: if it is actually the analysis work that I demand that we therefore have to connect to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210335	Thank you very much to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no more brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Rasmus Nordqvist from the Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210343	Yes, thank you. I do not know why we should always have the statement on these three organisations very late on Tuesday or Thursday evening, because it should actually be a party day when we have these debate on the statements, because they are three important organisations in their own way. Firstly, it is worth saying that, of course, in these organisations too, Russia is a great deal, and it is nice to see, I think how quickly all the organisations reacted on top of the attack and also nice to see that the Danish Government has been very active in that work. There is, of course, a great deal of work for the OSCE in collecting documentation and so on. In relation to the things that are happening at the moment. in Ukraine. But what I also need to talk about in relation to these three organisations, and what I really think I am going to spend my speaking time on is everything other than Russia. Because I do not think there is much to question in relation to what is stated in the statement and what is being done. But I also think it is important that these three organisations do not stop all the other work. Because, for example, if we do... the Council of Europe that it is not, after all, because there is no violation of human rights and there is no need for strong monitoring of many Member States. Some Member States are good at introducing legislation that you can sit and put your legs on, but then they are not so good at complying with it. A special focus that I have had in the periods when I have been in the parliamentary part of the Council of Europe has, of course, been on the rights of students, and there are a number of countries that have gradually begun to follow in terms of legislation. They can sit nicely, but when you talk to people from the countries in question, then their rights and security are not guaranteed by the states, and that is one of the things we need to be aware of, namely that we are taking this step forward in our work with the Member States and in their speeches. There is also another leg that I think is very important and on which, fortunately, the Council of Europe is also using energy now, and that is the whole link between the biodiversity crisis, climate crisis and human rights, in other words the human rights violations that are taking place in this area. This is something that cannot be stopped now, even though we have a terrible situation in Ukraine. I can say the same with regard to the Baltic Sea Council: it is a good thing that decisions have been taken, but the rest of us must continue to work because there are important things to do. The Baltic region is not doing well, and that is why we need the work that has been decided on in relation to sustainable conversion and the green development of the region, and we should really put turbo on it. Because I think that what we can learn right now from what is happening with Russia's attack on Ukraine is that the way we move closer together should also be used in all the other contexts. Then I would like to respond a little to the speech of the previous speaker, my good colleague from the Left. Because I remember when the Left was in power in this country. Fortunately it was a long time ago, and I sat in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe together with the previous speaker, and I remember that the Prime Minister of that time was down and speaking and putting the same questions to the Court of Justice and how much it had to interfere with a competent and virtuous country like Denmark. And I remember how our colleagues from the other countries, who themselves were nice bourgeois politicians from the Scandinavian countries, were sitting and shaking their heads. They were shaking their heads at the start of challenging the Court of Justice in this way, because the countries we know of that normally do not want to be compared to anyone. And I think it is a pity that this is again what you want to use energy on, i.e. time and again to stand and challenge that part of the work when we have such great challenges as we currently have. in relation to human rights, the rule of law and democracy in Europe. It was a pity that this was done at the time, many years ago, when the Left was in power, and I do not think it is something to be hoped that the present Danish Government will use energy on, because there are many, many other things to be spent on in the Council of Europe in these years. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210835	Thank you. This gave rise to a brief remark by Mr Beyer de Ryke. Michael Aastrup Jensen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210837	Thank you to the current speaker. After all, I would like to acknowledge that I have been in the Folketing for many years, so for me it doesn't feel like so long ago, but it probably depends on how long you've been in here. I just have to insist that the premise is, of course, who should have power in some key areas. Is it the national parliaments, or is it the court? That's what this is all about. It is simply a question of whether we should have the court going in and being politicians in some areas, for example. in the field of aliens. It is just my position and the position of the Left that we are still leaving, as we have reservations about the European Union, that the Court should take care of what the Court is good at, namely ensuring minimum rights for European citizens, so that they cannot be shrouded in dictatorships and the like, but it should not take over as a sort of overjudge for all parliaments in all key areas. That's where the difference is.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210942	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421210943	After all, this is not about the fact that the court will sit and write the Danish immigration policy. What the court wants to ensure is that the countries comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, and when the court goes in and makes an appeal to a country, it is because it does not comply with the Convention on Human Rights. Then I know you're talking about it being activist and what else you've used in terms of the time around the various courts. I just have to say that I am glad that we have a court that has actually developed, because otherwise we would not be where we stand today in relation, for example, tolgbti rights. This is precisely because there is always a development in how to read these paragraphs.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211023	Here you go, the questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211025	Yes, because it is also factually difficult to deny that the court interprets broader and broader • let us put it that way • in relation to when the convention was written. That's why you have to hold on to whether you think it's okay. That is a perfectly fair political point of view; it is just not our political point of view. In other words, our political view is that the Court must uphold the Convention, not least in relation to the countries which deny the Convention daily, but at the same time the national parliaments must also have the opportunity to conduct their own policy, and that is the balancing that is difficult; I recognise that, but that is the balancing that is necessary.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211107	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211108	Once again, I must say that I am very pleased that the convention is actually being interpreted, because if you followed it as the words are written, it was not good for people like myself and our rights in this society. So it's a good thing we have a court that follows time.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211127	Thank you very much to the SF rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. The next speaker is Mrs Anne Sophie Callesen from the Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211143	Thank you for the floor and thank you to the Minister for the statement, and I would also like to thank the rapporteur from the SF for his very clear speech and many points of view which I fully share, not least in relation to the Court of Justice, but I will actually come back to that. I would like to start by saying that I am focusing on the Council of Europe in my review here. That is where I myself recently entered the Parliamentary Assembly as an alternate. My first meeting was the extraordinary meeting to decide whether or not to exclude Russia. After all, it confirmed in every way the importance of the existence of the Council of Europe and also of the Parliamentary Assembly. And it was not because it was an easy choice, because it is clear that excluding Russia comes with a price, and it comes with a price for the ordinary Russian who loses access to the Court of Justice. At the same time, however, I do not think there is any doubt that if not attacking a country in this way and with the war crimes and the totally unprecedented aggression that Russia has shown against Ukraine is a red line, what is? And if you can continue to be a member of the Council of Europe with that behaviour, when else can you be thrown out? It was a meeting which was very landmark in many respects, and it was also moving to see the Ukrainian members who were present. As I have said, this confirmed to me the importance of having a strong Council for Europe, and now we have to take the consequence of the fact that we have thrown Russia out, and also from Denmark, I believe, increasing our financial support for the organisation, which is absolutely necessary now that Russia cannot continue to contribute financially, because they are no longer there. However, it is clear that, as others have said, we must not forget the other human rights problems which also exist among several Member States. It is absolutely crucial to stick to it while Ukraine is paramount, but it must not be so overshadowing that we do not focus on, among other things, Ukraine. Poland, Hungary and Turkey in particular. In conclusion, I would just like to say that I am glad that the statement does not state that there is any dissatisfaction with this alleged judicial activism on the part of the government. However, I am still a little concerned when, on the one hand, you say that you want to focus on the rule of law and, on the other hand, you want to influence the interpretation of the Court of Justice in Denmark's direction. I will then be a little worried about what exactly that means, but I would certainly be glad that you do not choose to criticise the case law of the Court of Justice. With those words, I would just like to thank you for a good debate so far.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211511	Thank you to the radical rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Søren Søndergaard from Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421211524	Thank you. I would also like to thank you for your statement. I think that, when you read the statement, you can see and it is quite natural that it has been written relatively shortly after the events that have taken place in Ukraine, with Russia's invasion, which means that it has not quite settled what it is actually going to mean, and that means that that discussion is going to take place. I think that Russia's invasion has in various ways raised some very fundamental questions at the OSCE, at the Council of Europe and at the Baltic Council. Overall, the reaction to the invasion has been beautiful and fine. In the OSCE, the invasion was condemned by a large majority of the countries, and resolutions have also been adopted in the Parliamentary Assembly with largely unanimity, and that is very, very clear and fine, great. It has not been possible to rule out this type of decision because it has to be taken unanimously. In the Council of Europe, 42 countries out of 47 in the Committee of Ministers supported a suspension, and there is the possibility of suspending, and when we had it in the Parliamentary Assembly, it was a clear decision. I think it is worth noting that there are people sitting from the extreme right to the extreme left, and it must be understood quite literally, this is a consensus parliament, in relation to what it is like in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and a unanimous decision was taken to support the suspension of Russia. And then there is the Baltic Council, where all the Member States, except Russia, which has shown 10 in addition to Russia, have agreed to suspend Russia. So the reaction has been as good within the framework that exists as it could possibly have been. However, as I mentioned, where the Council of Europe and the Baltic Sea Council have condemned and ruled out or suspended, Russia continues in the OSCE, and this is because of the various roles, consensus, which is part of the basis of the history of the OSCE, that it should be decided by consensus, and so to speak, that the organisation has been established to engage in dialogue with Russia or what was before. It was like the CSCE process that was about this dialogue, and so it can be said that if you like to remove that leg on the chair, what is left? I think that this situation raises the issue of the relevance and ability of the OSCE to function. After all, we can already see that the work of the OSCE has deteriorated over a long period of time. There have also been conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have been unbearable to listen to, at least in the Parliamentary Assembly, I do not know what it has been like in the Committee of Ministers. As of 2014, however, following Crimea, we have seen a blockade in a number of areas. We have had vacant posts in central places, and it had to be adopted unanimously, and it has simply been blocked, and for long periods there have been no central posts in the OSCE. After all, this process is further deteriorating by Russia's invasion. What will be the consequences for field operations to be supported by unanimity? What will be the consequences for the budget, which must also be adopted unanimously? What kind of situation do we look forward to, then, is Russia having to accept these things about the budget and all the things that are being done for the budget, in the tense situation that exists? I think this suggests that this is going to be very difficult. At any rate, I would call for no concessions to be made, for a compromise not to be reached and then we ignore it, and then we do not investigate it, and then it is all right that we do not send election observers, everything that could now be of this kind to ensure that there is a consensus organisation. Then I would rather you say that okay, we shut it down so to speak and turn it into a purely sleeping organisation, don't call meetings, and then hopefully we wait for better times when a new regime comes in Moscow when Putin is gone, and some others have arrived, and then you can try to revive it. What must not happen is that you compromise it, because you compromise it, you compromise an idea, and then you compromise the possibility of doing something afterwards. It can be said that things are different with the Baltic Council and with the Council of Europe, because they have tasks that are completely independent of Russia. I'm sorry to say this, but it doesn't matter if Russia is involved. It would be very good for Russia, and especially the Russian people, for Russia to be part of the Council of Europe, but there are many years that they have not been part of the Council of Europe, and yet the Council of Europe has some central tasks, even some central tasks, in relation to what was previously part of the Soviet Union, but which are now separated from Russia's grip: Moldova, Ukraine, etc. etc. What does this lead me to? This brings me to the point whether the task is not to give priority to the Council of Europe, in other words to recognise that some of the tasks, election observation etc., missions, monitoring, which has been in the OSCE, must be transferred to the Council of Europe, because how can they be carried out in the OSCE without making concessions to Russia? And what does it mean to give priority to? Yes, that does not mean that we should accept anything in the Council of Europe; the red line is that if we do not comply with the Court of Justice's rulings, we must ultimately get out of the guard. However, priority matters partly with the tasks, and it also means something at the economic level to replace the situation that has arisen after Russia, which has made a contribution, is pulling out. And I think that the Foreign Minister has received a letter from the President, the President we call it, from the Parliamentary Assembly, calling precisely for the first step to be taken to cover the losses caused by Russia's withdrawal. For that means downgrading the Council of Europe if that money is not covered, and the letter refers to the fact that the German Bundestag has given a guarantee that they will help to ensure that there will not be a financial damage, that is, the financial destruction of the Council of Europe, and as far as the letter here says, it also applies to France and the Netherlands. I would like to ask the Foreign Minister directly: will the Foreign Minister agree to this initiative and ensure that we do not have a reduction in activity due to Russia's exclusion? And there may be more, because there are other matters which are currently being brought to an end, but we will see that. The second point I want to ask the Minister directly is whether the Minister will take the initiative to have a discussion on whether we should simply move tasks from the OSCE to the Council of Europe or how we tackle the situation that Russia, as long as it exists, has a right of veto. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421212332	Thank you to the rapporteur for the Enhedslisten. There are no brief comments. The next speaker is Mr. Marcus Knuth of the Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421212346	Thank you, President. As I said in my speech before, we have been overtaken by reality, and that is also the case here. I had prepared a speech on the OSCE and the Council of Europe, etc. back in February, and I will be honest and say that that speech was quite similar to last year's speech and that of the previous year, because so much has not changed in relation to these speeches. But it was so until we were hit by reality on 24 February, as several speakers have said. I think there are many who can now see that the Russians probably expected that the West would not stand together if it were so that they invaded Ukraine that they could roll into the country without our various forums and communities so really would respond. And that's what we can see fortunately didn't happen. For it is precisely these communities where we have worked together for decades that immediately proved their worth in the days after 24 February. The OSCE immediately stopped negotiations with Russia on membership, and indeed in the run-up to, among other things. With the Polish Presidency of the OSCE, the OSCE was used as a very good platform to try to stop Russia's marching along the border with Ukraine. And at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Europe, just mentioned by the rapporteur for the Enhedslisten, 42 out of 47 Member States voted to exclude Russia. It has only happened once in the past that the Council has suspended a member; it was in 1969 on the basis of Greece's military junta. And I noted the fine statements made by the Foreign Minister, not in relation to Greece's military junta, but in relation to Russia's exclusion, where the Minister said that we must use all the forces we have in the European Union to isolate Russia globally. And, of course, that is also in the light of the sanctions against Russia, where we have stood firm and united against Russia. Similarly, the Baltic Council has suspended the participation of both Russia and Belarus here. Now it has been a long evening with some of the same issues that we also addressed in the debate before, so I would like to conclude by saying that I am just glad, although the backdrop is terribly sad, to see that our international forums have entered into force so effectively and immediately in relation to Russia. Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that I agree with Mrs Annette Lind in the hope of • although it is probably a very naive hope that when we stand here next year, we are back in some of those more standard speeches we usually make here, and that the world is a better place where we do not have to focus on all the terrible things that are happening.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421212628	Thank you very much to the Conservative rapporteur. There are no brief comments. That leaves room for the next rapporteur, who is Mr. Søren Espersen from the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421212637	Thank you very much, and I will be brief. I just want to talk about diplomacy, which I announced earlier in the evening. It is clear, as the Minister knows, that in principle the Danish People's Party has never been a sworn supporter of sanctions in general, but if it is a question of sanctions, for example. in relation to the ability of Russian individuals to travel and maintain connections and to freeze funds, it may be a very strong weapon, and I think that is already being quite visible. Analysts point out that all these economically strong people are getting tired of what is going on, and when one further senses that leading Russian officers are in the same way deeply frustrated that one does not seem to succeed in a military way, and that a rushed invasion was amateurish in its execution, we have a cocktail of military leaders and wealthy men who may be able to make life even harder for President Putin and even take power away from him. Well, let's hope that's what's gonna happen. However, one place where I do not agree with the mark on Russia is when it comes to the expulsion of a number of diplomats. I believe that in Denmark there was a question of 12. The expulsions seem clearly coordinated with a large number of other countries which took the same steps. I guess it ended with hundreds. In any case, the explanation was that the diplomats had engaged in espionage. It was a little weird, you might think that all of a sudden in all countries and at once you found out that there were a lot of spies exactly at their embassy and of course there was. There is always espionage from the embassies, and I should be very disappointed if one day it should turn out that Danish embassy people did not. It depends on how to define espionage, and the definition has a broad framework. Russia is responding again. It will soon come to us too by expelling and also by repatriating Western diplomats. But when I do not like the expulsions, this is because we are getting everything back from our counterpart, so to speak, and this will mean that our ability to gather information in Russia and get a comprehensive picture of what is really going on in that country is getting worse, and what have we actually gained from it? Having a sense of what is happening in Russia has passed away. United States diplomats remained in Nazi Germany until Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to war against both Japan and Nazi Germany. It is clear that when there is a state of war, the direct link must stop, at least officially. Because there were unofficial meetings between the US/England and Nazi Germany throughout the war. They were then just via neutral countries such as Switzerland and Portugal. I would like the Foreign Minister to have a discussion of principle one day, because something similar can happen one day, of how wise it is to expel whole groups with the somewhat sought explanation that espionage is. There are many things from the Minister's statement that I would have liked to have mentioned, but I think I am going to leave it at this, not least because we have already addressed a great many of the issues under R 11. So I will stop here and just thank the Minister once again for a very good statement. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421212959	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. This means that the next person on the platform is the Secretary of State. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421213026	Thank you very much, President. First of all, thank you for your contributions, and also congratulations to Mr Seligman. Michael Aastrup Jensen for the 15th anniversary of the Parliamentary Council of Europe. In fact, I think, and I would like to say this here, that the debate we are having at this late hour should be held at another time, because what we are doing here is insanely important. When we also talk about strengthening our multilateral cooperation and promoting some of the things we stand for, these organisations are, of course, tools for that, where we can be active both as a government and, incidentally, also as parliamentarians. So I don't think you can give enough priority to that. That's it. But there have been other matters on the agenda today in the Folketing, I can see. Of course, as in the previous debate, the debate has focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and here I would just like to say a few words about our response to the international organisations in general, and then I would just like to say a few words about my expectations of future work, specifically of course in the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Baltic Sea Council. Russia has brought the war to Europe with unimaginable and tragic consequences. The pictures from Butja also show us Russia's brutality in the war. Many Ukrainians have been killed in the defense of their homeland, even more have been wounded. I think we are up to about 5 million refugees fleeing their country of origin, and we are now facing the greatest security policy crisis for decades. We also face a serious threat to the rule-based world order that we have built up since World War II and the fundamental principle of the right of all states to self-determination. Russia is seriously violating international rules and has not wanted to go down the road of dialogue. If we let it go unanswered that Russia, in violation of international law, is attacking a sovereign neighbouring country, we will erode the very basis for cooperation in international organisations. Therefore, since the invasion, we have been offensive, as several have noted, in our efforts to isolate Russia from the international community. We are doing this together with our partners in the European Union and with equal countries from the rest of the world and, of course, with Ukraine. At the same time, we are particularly aware of preventing our efforts from undermining the international alliance around Ukraine, because there is a strong alliance, because we can see that European and transatlantic cohesion has been historic during this crisis, but also global cohesion has proved exceptionally strong. It is worth noting that we in the United Nations, with an overwhelming majority of 141 and 140 Member States respectively, have adopted two historic resolutions condemning Russia's attacks and their humanitarian consequences. We also need to hold on to broad support. In all three international organisations we are debating here today, we have also clearly shown Russia that we are united with Ukraine. To various extents we have cut ties with Russia. In the OSCE, cooperation with Russia has been reduced to an absolute minimum. Russia is suspended in the Baltic Council, and in the Council of Europe we have completely excluded Russia. I shall now try to discuss some of the expectations of the future work of the organisations in more detail. In the OSCE, and many rightly affected, the Russian invasion of Ukraine obviously overshadows the normal agenda of the organisation. Ukraine has long been at the heart of discussions in the OECD, and the Russian troop building around Ukraine in December and January gave rise to a number of initiatives. The provisions of the Vienna document were called for knowledge of the Russian troop building. In February, the Secretary-General of the OSCE also shouted with the so-called early warning mechanism. The Secretary-General invited States Parties to implement confidence-building and security-building measures to prevent escalation. The Polish Presidency took the initiative of a renewed security dialogue for Europe to engage OSCE participating states in Europe's stability. None of these actions were met with Russian engagement • none! After all, on 24 February it was quite clear that Russia and Belarus completely disregarded the principles and obligations that they themselves have shared in adopting in the OSCE. That is why the vast majority of OSCE participating states have united in condemning the invasion and in supporting the work of the Polish Presidency to keep Ukraine at the top of the agenda. It is true that the OSCE, first of all the CSCE, was set up almost 50 years ago, in 2025 when we mark the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Process as a forum for dialogue between warring parties, in other words between East and West during the Cold War. A forum in which all actors sit on the same table, not only the EU countries with Russia, but also the United States, Ukraine, Belarus, the Western Balkans and former Soviet republics, and, in particular, in an armed conflict, there is a need for a place to exchange information and where the door is kept open to return to common commitments. Arms control, which we have also discussed in the past, is an important part of the OSCE's work on joint commitments, mechanisms for transparency and confidence building. This work has long had difficult conditions and it is difficult to see for itself, at least now, how to have a meaningful conversation about arms control in Vienna, while Russia is carrying out an attack war in Ukraine. But it is precisely when there is a lack of confidence that confidence building is most relevant. It is a core issue for us to maintain and modernise the European security architecture. I therefore hope that the OSCE can once again become the central framework for these discussions, but it is clear that it will require a significant change in Russia's behaviour before we get there. At the same time, it is also important to stick to the value-policy action of the OSCE. Despite the challenges and sharp political dividing lines, Denmark continues to play a very active role in keeping human rights and democracy promotion high on the agenda. In view of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Denmark, together with Ukraine, was at the beginning of March a driving force in setting up an independent OSCE expert mission, the so-called Moscow mechanism. The expert mission shall ensure that evidence of Russian breaches of human rights and international law in Ukraine is provided. This is an important step in the overall effort to bring Russia to account for its actions, and Denmark has also led the last year to maintain international pressure on Belarus in the OSCE, among other things. by constantly requiring the regime to respond to ongoing and serious human rights violations in the country. I myself was the co-host of an event focusing on Belarus at the OSCE ministerial meeting in December, which I must say was very well attended. At the Council of Ministers, Denmark also took the initiative for the fifth consecutive year of a strong joint declaration on fundamental freedoms and human rights, which brought together record support from 48 of the 57 OSCE member states. At the same time, in 2021, Denmark has worked to follow up the Danish Council of Ministers' decision on the fight against torture from 2020, among others. with an anti-terrorism conference with the participation of civil society and experts. And Denmark will also continue to use OSCE structures and informal forums in the coming years to actively promote Danish values and priorities. I think this has only become more important in view of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and there is no doubt that Russian behaviour in Ukraine will make cooperation in the OSCE even more difficult, both in terms of the dialogue on European security, the fights for values and the work on conventional arms control and confidence-building measures. But the OSCE is not least important relations with the frontline states that surround Russia. For them, cooperation such as the OSCE is important not to stand alone between Russia and China. In the Council of Europe we have had to take the sad but absolutely necessary step of excluding Russia. It is an historic step, but a real step, and I am pleased that all the Member States supported it and that it did so in close cooperation, as was also noted, with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. And I hope that one day Russia will once again be able to rejoin the Council of Europe and assume the responsibilities that come with it. President Putin and the Russian leadership, with the attack on Ukraine, have deprived their own citizens of the protection afforded to them by the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights. Putin is moving down the authoritarian path at an unprecedented rate, both externally, towards Ukraine, and internally, vis-à-vis Russian citizens. This is not compatible with the Council of Europe's fundamental values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Ukraine has chosen the path towards democracy, the establishment of a rule of law and the protection of human rights. That is why, in this extremely difficult time for Ukraine, we must of course help and support as much as possible. When I look beyond the Member States of the Council of Europe, unfortunately, things are going well, and it is also important to emphasise that many places are in the wrong direction, and that is deeply worrying. We see that the judiciary is being pressed, we see that women and the rights of people with disabilities are weakening, as was also noted, among other things. by Mr. Rasmus Nordqvist, and we see that freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of assembly are restricted. We therefore want to maintain pressure on Russia here too, and although we all know that this is going to be difficult, work must be done, among other things. to provide support to civil society organisations and the protection of independent journalists. The situation in Turkey is also very worrying. We have constantly pointed out the illegal imprisonment of opposition politicians and human rights activists, and let me specifically highlight the human rights defender Osman Kavala. Already in 2019, the Court of Human Rights made it quite clear that he should be released immediately. Today he's still sitting behind bars. That is why we have put the chair at the door of Turkey and initiated the so-called infringement procedure. Right now, the case lies with the court, which is called upon to reconsider its position. A judgment may be passed this summer. If Turkey does not comply with a new judgment, we may ultimately be forced to take a position on Turkey's membership of the Council of Europe. Of course, I take this matter very seriously. In Belarus, too, developments are going in the very wrong direction. Most recently, Belarus has actively supported and been involved in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and this is, of course, reprehensible. Although Belarus is not a member of the Council of Europe, we have now suspended all cooperation with that country. On the other hand, efforts must be made to strengthen cooperation with the opposition. Unfortunately, the challenges for both an independent judiciary and other freedoms are not restricted to countries outside the European Union. We thought that the principles of the rule of law were safe in the European Union, but unfortunately we are also seeing a decline in EU countries, and here too the Court of Human Rights, the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe monitoring mechanisms play a valuable role. This also applies within the framework of EU cooperation. The Council of Europe is not just a protection of existing rights; we must also use it actively when we see the need to develop citizens' legal protection in new areas. That is why we decided last year to launch work on a new legal framework for the use of artificial intelligence and the protection of human rights, and we are intensifying that work now. In other areas, too, such as: I see opportunities for greater momentum for women, girls and Igbti people and cooperation with civil society, as Russia has in many cases held back developments in this area in the Council of Europe when they were members. The Court of Human Rights, which has also been debated, is a cornerstone of the European human rights system. It is the courts that are the ultimate guarantee that fundamental rights are respected in all Member States. The Court of Justice has done a great deal of good for the development of human rights in Europe, but sometimes, and this has also been noted, it also goes too far. And from the Danish side we are therefore still aware of the development and interpretation of human rights. We are therefore constantly assessing whether we should go into other Member States' cases in so-called third-party interventions. This applies to cases where we see the risk that the court might go too far in its interpretation, but that applies, for example. Also, cases where European values are at stake are basically at stake. And to give an example, last year we entered into a Polish case in principle concerning the independence of the courts, in which Poland was, in fact, recently convicted. It is important for Denmark that we have a well-run Council of Europe. We do, but it can be even better, and that is why we also support the work on radical reforms in the Council of Europe. We have, among other things. done with the 2018 Copenhagen Declaration, just as we do in these years with the Danish Presidency, in fact, and the Council of Europe's budget group. At the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Turin in May, this is just about here, we must ensure that, after Russia's exclusion, the Council of Europe also plays a central role in the development of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and from Denmark we will support the democratically elected government. Support for it in Ukraine is, of course, central. Finally, allow me to make a few comments on the Baltic Sea Council. We have also suspended Russia from participating in the Baltic Council, as we have with Belarus, which is an observer state, as you know. For Denmark, the Council remains an important platform for regional dialogue and cooperation in the Baltic Sea region. It is therefore important that we do not allow Russia and Belarus to sabotage Baltic cooperation through their aggression. Parts of the practical cooperation under the Baltic Sea Council have become even more important because of the war in Ukraine. This is true, for example. cooperation on trafficking in human beings and the protection of vulnerable children. The Council's Committee of Officials is currently working on adapting the organisation to the suspension decision. We can and must continue to work, but we must not let Russia's invasion go unnoticed. It's still too early to assess the long-term consequences of the decision for the organization, but the government's starting point is that we should try to build on the most valuable part of this cooperation. Norway's Foreign Minister, Norway, has now invited the Presidency to a meeting of Foreign Ministers in Kristiansand on 24 and 25 May, and the meeting, which will be the first formal Council meeting since 2014, thus gives an opportunity to signal that the Council, even without Russia, remains an important platform for regional dialogue and cooperation in the Baltic Sea region, and this is, of course, a meeting that I intend to prioritise. So thank you for your comments. Several questions have been asked to which I would just like to make a few comments. To Mr. Søren Søndergaard: I have also explained here how important both the Council of Europe and the OSCE are, and I agree that we can discuss how we handle the tasks in the light of Russia's action. This is something that we, among other things, are doing. will do in May when we have our European Council in the Committee of Ministers in Turin. To Mr. Søren Espersen, I would just like to say on the question of expelling Russian diplomats, spies, that is to say the 15 that we have shown: I think this is the right decision in the light of the aggression that Russia has made in Ukraine, and the threat to European security, the war that is now in Europe and Europe, we are at war to defend our values, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries, and therefore it is also true that we in Denmark and in a number of other European countries have taken the step of expelling those spies. That said, diplomacy is an important tool, not only in times of peace but also in times of war. That is why we have not expelled the Russian ambassador, and we also have an embassy that works in Moscow, just as other countries do, and that is important, also in order to keep track of what is going on in Russia. So that's where we stand. But it's not easy when Russia breaks all Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214742	Thank you to the Secretary of State. There are a few brief comments, first from Mrs Sophie Callesen from the Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214745	Thank you. I would first like to ask about the budget for the Council of Europe, because for a number of years there has been a erosion due to a real zero goal policy, and now we have Russia pulling out at the same time. So will the government work to help ensure that the budget is restored and that there is no continued erosion and now even more with Russia's exit?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214813	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214814	Thank you for the question from Mrs Sophie Callesen. It is clear that Russia's exclusion has many implications for the Council of Europe. You have been one of the major payers, and that is why the lack of payments will be felt, and so I hope to be able to discuss with my colleagues, as I mentioned earlier, at the Foreign Minister's meeting in Turin this May, how we are doing now, and here the Council of Europe secretariat has the opportunity to present their proposals on a way forward. However, I agree that it is important that we countries of the Council of Europe take responsibility for our having a well-functioning organisation.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214855	Mrs. Anne Sophie Callesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214856	Thank you. Of course, we will keep an eye on that. Then I would like to turn immediately to another issue which concerns Poland and Hungary, which, as stated in the statement, has attracted attention in the Council of Europe. I would just like to ask whether this attention has led Denmark, together with some other like-minded countries, to ask for a debate on the compliance of the two countries with their obligations on the agenda of the Council of Ministers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214921	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214922	Yes, Denmark has an ongoing focus on both Poland and Hungary and other countries and their compliance with obligations. I also mentioned how important the various mechanisms we have are, both the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the Venice Commission and other important mechanisms that help to monitor the legal situation, the legal developments in these two countries, both Poland and Hungary, and that is also something we are using in the dialogue with the two countries. So, yes, we focus on that, and that question is something that we work with in all organisations.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214954	Thank you. The next brief remark is from Mr. Søren Søndergaard. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421214957	Thank you, Minister, for raising the issue of the Council of Europe's economy. We look forward to coming back to that. The Minister is quite right about the OSCE that the OSCE is an extremely important organisation because of the confidence-building measures, and that is why it may be the place where you start when some things develop. Our problem is, of course, that the OSCE is more than that; the OSCE is also some very concrete activities that are taking place here and now, in other words, the field missions, the office of freedom of expression, the office of human rights, all those things where the rapporteurs are going, conferences. And that is something that is bound up with the budget, and if it is blocked, or if Russia does not want to take part in the appointment of people or demands something in return for doing so, then those things are facing weakening or disappearing. And that is why the debate is topical: how do we ensure that they survive in any case?
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215103	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215105	To Mr. Søren Søndergaard: I have also noted the question, and that is an important issue. Well, I do not think it can be ruled out that it can end up where Russia chooses to leave the OSCE at some point. At least in those countries which are very active in the OSCE as Member States, we are concerned that the organisation is working and that the mandates that you have are being followed and that you ensure that you have a well-functioning organisation that has an important task, not only in relation to Russia, but also in relation to all OSCE countries, as I mentioned earlier, including those which lie between Russia and China, and, of course, with the United States and Canada. It is, of course, a rather unique organisation in that it is not only European countries, it can be said, but also Central Asian countries. So we will continue to do so, and I agree with the view that we should not allow the standards and mandates of the OSCE to be watered down by the fact that we have a Russia which does not comply with the rules that they themselves have signed up to, and that, of course, is something we will be watching. Russia must then, if they do not want to do so, choose to leave the OSCE.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215208	Here you go, sir. Søren Søndergaard.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215210	I just want to say that I look forward to having a discussion on this. After all, there was a lot of talk about a European security structure when the CSC process and the OSCE were established, and it is of course an important discussion to discuss the link between the various multilateral cooperation forums. So I look forward to us coming back to the discussion. Because we must not get into the situation where the important tasks of the OSCE are being stopped or watered down. Then we'll have to find other places they can continue.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215244	Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215246	Yes, and this is where it is important that we have a forum for dialogue on what are common security problems and the creation of confidence-building measures, for example. weapons control, transparency. This helps to create security for all Europeans, and some of those instruments are really important, and we are about to mark, in 2025, the 50th anniversary of the CSC, for the Helsinki process, and I think it is important in the time we live in when geopolitics are back and where uncertainty is left, that we have an organisation such as the OSCE, which can provide a framework for some of these dialogues, including those with which we disagree and with which we are in conflict. So that is the balancing point, but I will continue to look forward to the discussion. We will continue to condemn Russia, we will continue to say to Russia that they must comply with the rules of the game that they have committed themselves to in the OSCE, and if they do not, we will continue to isolate Russia, and whether they ultimately choose to leave the OSCE and their obligations must be their choice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215349	Thank you to the Secretary of State. No one else asked for the floor. As no one else has asked to speak, this debate has ended.
ParlaMint-DK_20220421215400	There is therefore no more to be done in this sitting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Friday 22 April 2022, at 12.00 p.m. 10:00. I refer to the agenda set out in the Danish Parliament's website.
