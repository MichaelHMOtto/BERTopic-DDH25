ParlaMint-DK_20220602100033	PRESIDENT. - The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: 1 and 2 of a minority (V), joined by a minority (SF, RV, EL, KF, NB, FG, IA, Simon Emil Ammitzbøll-Ammitzbøll-Bille (UFG) and Karina Adsbøl (UFG)), which together constitute a majority, or on Amendment No 1. 3, to be elected by a majority (the committee with the exception of the FG)? They are adopted. I propose that the bill should go directly to the third reading without referral back to committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
