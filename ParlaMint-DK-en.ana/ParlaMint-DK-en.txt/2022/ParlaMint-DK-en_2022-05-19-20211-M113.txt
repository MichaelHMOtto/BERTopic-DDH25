I propose that the draft law should go directly to the third reading without referral back to committee and, if no one objects, I consider it adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519103752	The debate is open. First, it's the Minister of Health.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519103813	Thank you. And thank you to the SF for making this proposal, which addresses inequality in health, which we know is particularly pronounced among people with mental disorders. And statistics speak their clear language: people with mental disorders live up to 15, yes, in fact up to 20 years shorter than the rest of the population. We must now work on a ten-year plan for psychiatry, which must strengthen our psychiatry structurally and in the long term, and here we have among other things. focus on general treatment interventions for people with mental disorders. This concrete proposal for systematic judicial autopsies over a two-year period for people with mental illness is a proposal that we in the government must reject. This is because the proposers have not indicated funding. The proposal is estimated to cost 15 million. kr. It is true that when proposals are put forward, there is a price with which there are some proposals, and that is why I would urge the authors of the motion to put it in a different context; this can be done, among other things, during a two-year period. be in the context of the negotiations on what is called the SSA reserve, but otherwise, of course, also in the financial law negotiations. In conclusion, I would like to point out that in 2009 and by 2018 at the latest, the Danish Health Authority was before the project SURVIVE, but after all quite recently estimated that there are already the necessary tools that can contribute to knowledge of overmortality among people with mental disorders without the use of systematic autopsies. And the Danish Health Authority also noted at that time that the financial and, not least, the personal costs of systematic autopsies do not measure up to the knowledge that can be obtained. And that means that for those reasons too, the government is rejecting this motion for a resolution. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104038	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Trine Torp, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104041	Thank you. One is the discussion about funding. That can always be discussed, and we are, of course, open to financing it in the way we could now find out. But if we take the content: the Minister refers to the fact that the necessary tools to contribute to the knowledge of morbidity and mortality among patients with mental illness are already available without further use of autopsies, but it is on the basis, as the Minister himself says, of research findings known before SURVIVE. But why does the Minister not take a closer look at the results of the SURVIVE project? And on what does the Minister base the claim that autopsies do not lead to knowledge that is not known in advance?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104123	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104124	In the Ministry of Health we have not received any information that the Danish Health Authority has dealt with this SURVIVE project, so what I referred to was that in 2009 and in 2018 the Danish Health Authority estimated that there are already the necessary tools that will contribute to knowledge about overmortality among people with mental disorders without the use of systematic autopsies. And then the Danish Health Authority has also had these concerns where they have just noticed that the personal and also financial costs of systematic autopsies do not match the knowledge that can be achieved. We are, of course, in an ongoing dialogue with the Danish Health Authority, and if the Danish Health Authority wants to take a closer look at the SURVIVE project and ends up with a different conclusion, we have a different situation, but so far this is the Danish Health Authority's assessment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104221	Mrs. Trine Torp, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104223	Yes, thank you for that, but it is a little too bad not to relate to the SURVIVE project, given that reference is made to it in the motion for a resolution. One of the points made by the project is that there is a significant proportion of deaths among people with mental disorders caused by medication. Does the Minister believe that he can stand up to the fact that we have sufficient knowledge about whether mentally ill people die from the treatment they receive?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104249	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104250	I think we can always use more knowledge. As I mentioned, I call on the proposers to raise this point in the debates where there are means to be distributed for good purposes, and if you do so, you will also be able to get assessments from the Health Service and, for example, the Health Service. get to know if their bad judgment has been changed due to... the most recent information.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104323	Mrs Liselot Blixt, outside the groups.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104324	Thank you very much. This again shows that the government has gone out with that you want to do a lot for the mentally ill. You keep kicking everything to the corner and to a psychiatry plan that won't even see its reality in this period. Now we are talking about an area which is not equal to the autopsies of others who die at a younger age. Here it is, at the expense of the state that actually gives them medication and treatment, and then you do not actually want to autopsy them because it costs money. That is just exactly what happens every time we talk about mental illness, psychiatric treatment and what you want to do. So when will equality be achieved in this area?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104411	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104412	That is a completely incorrect description of the situation. Since this government came into being, we have given priority to the psychiatric area every year, and in the first financial law we entered into with the Finance Law parties, we lifted the area by 600 million. kr., both for more beds and for more staff and a stronger effort both in children's and young psychiatry and in court psychiatry. It is not a one-off investment or one-off, it is a permanent, lasting boost, compared to what it was like before the last parliamentary elections. So it is quite wrong to say that this government does not give priority to the area. We've got a permanent boost of 600 million. kr. Staying extra every year. This proposal is about a different approach, and there is no funding in the proposal at all, and of that principle we cannot support it here, because there must be funding. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104516	Mrs. Liselot Blixt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104517	I do not agree with the Minister. Yes, a fixed amount of 600 million has been given to the psychiatry. In the first year it was not used at all because the regions used it for everything else... to pay off loans and all sorts of other things. You haven't lifted the psychiatry like you promised. That's what we have to look at, that's the bottom line. It looks worse now than it did 3-4 years ago. So that's not true. You don't follow developments. Yes, money has been set aside, but you cannot continue to live on that every year, and when there are proposals that actually say that now we have to find out why so many people die at a younger age because they have a mental illness, you will not be there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104552	The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104553	Thank you for recognising that funds have been set aside, because there are. It must then be followed by a 10-year plan for psychiatry. Note here also the Danish Health Authority's assessment of the personal costs of such systematic autopsies. The Danish Health Authority felt that in 2018, and this is the latest thing we have from the Danish Health Authority in this area, did not measure up to the knowledge that will be achieved. It should not be forgotten that there are also some personal costs of such systematic obstructions by so many people.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104625	Then it's Mrs. Jane Heitmann, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104628	Thank you for that and thank you for your speech to the Minister. After all, the Minister himself mentions the ten-year plan for psychiatry, and there is, of course, a suggestion that we should have a thematic meeting here within a relatively short time horizon. But I would just like to ask the Minister: when will we be called for real negotiations? One can, of course, hold a thematic meeting at the thematic meeting, but I want to hear the Minister: when do we go to the bite so that we can have a political agreement on the 10-year plan for psychiatry that is really needed?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104658	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104659	This government went to the polls to take two significant steps which were about significant improvements in psychiatry. One was a promise to strengthen psychiatry by 0.5 billion. kr. annual. The second was a promise to strengthen psychiatry with a new 10-year plan for psychiatry. The first promise has been complied with; we have actually given more, because it is not only 500 million. DKK, but 600 million. kr. Every year, with which we have strengthened in relation to the previous government. It is, of course, money from the treasury, from the community paid through the tax, which we invest in psychiatry. There's really a need for this boost, which is a boost that you can't see from day one, because something requires you to expand and so on. The second element is a 10-year plan for psychiatry. Some time ago I commissioned a technical contribution from my colleague, the Minister for Social Affairs, and that is exactly the contribution that we now have, and I am pleased about that. That means that it must then form the basis for political negotiations.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104801	Mrs. Jane Heitmann.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104802	The Minister is not answering my question. Well, I hear a lot of words from the Minister about everything else, but not an answer to the question. It is, in fact, a matter for a minister, I would say, when does the Minister call for real negotiations? I fully agree that the Danish Health Authority has contributed with a very, very nice technical presentation, but to date we have not seen as much as a line from the government, in relation to which direction the government will turn the psychiatry. And one may well have the expectation that a government proposal could form the basis for political discussions. The Minister of Health will be there too). So I will try again, Minister: when will we be called for real negotiations?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104838	Thank you! Remember, we don't talk in each other's mouth down here. That is why I am taking the floor and giving the floor to the Minister for Health. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104848	Thank you. I fully follow my answer from the first round of answers, namely: we have promised before the elections that there will be a 10-year plan for psychiatry in this parliamentary term. We have also written it into our understanding paper with the parties that negotiated it, which means that the government will come up with a proposal for a 10-year plan for psychiatry, which we can then negotiate with the parties of the Danish Parliament. The academic basis for the negotiations consists partly of the academic basis of the Danish Health and Social Security Authority and partly of the thematic discussion we now have.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104922	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments, and that means that we are starting with the rapporteur's series. It's first Mrs. Julie Skovsby, the Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519104935	Thank you for the floor and thank you to the SF for raising a debate focusing on a central inequality in health, namely that people with mental disorders live significantly shorter than the rest of the population. This is a massive inequality that we have known for many years, and one of the main objectives of the forthcoming 10-year plan is precisely to increase the average life expectancy of people with mental disorders, because we basically believe that it is unfair that there should be so much difference between people in our country. In the academic presentation of a 10-year plan, one can read that mental disorders are the cause of approx. 3,500 deaths a year. It is thus the fourth most common cause of death in Denmark. People with severe mental disorders live on average up to 15-20 years shorter than the population as a whole. We can and must do something about that. More people have to live longer, and they have to have a good life while they live. That is why I am also pleased that the technical proposal contains a number of proposals for action against those who are most affected by mental illness and who live in the shortest time. I look forward to discussing this in the context of the 10-year plan. The proposal here is specifically about the need to legislate on the introduction of systematic judicial autopsies for a two-year period for all early and unexpected deaths of people with mental disorders. The aim is to gain more knowledge of the causes of the high mortality rate. As I read the proposal, we are particularly concerned to see whether medicines are helping to speed up or directly cause more of the deaths. We fully agree that more knowledge and research are needed when talking about mental disorders. It is also one of the recommended measures in the technical presentation, because the research in psychiatry has lagged behind the somatics. However, we are not convinced that the solution must be a legal requirement for judicial autopsies. The Danish Health Authority has previously reported that the necessary tools to contribute to new knowledge of disease and mortality among patients with mental illness are already available without further use of autopsies. This means that the costs of routine compulsory autopsies do not match the knowledge that can be obtained. So although we are very much in agreement with the intentions for more knowledge, we are not convinced that this proposal will be the way forward or will contribute with the new knowledge that is being sought. Finally, the proposal is not financed, and that is why the funding must be found by cutting the room for manoeuvre. However, with the assessment made by the Danish Health Authority, we cannot support the proposal. Social democracy cannot therefore vote in favour of the proposal as it stands here, but we are very concerned about the issue of inequality in health and overmortality among people with mental illness, and we look forward, as I have said, to strengthening efforts in the forthcoming negotiations on a 10-year plan for psychiatry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105338	Thank you. There are brief comments. First, it is from Mrs Jane Heitmann, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105342	Thank you for that and thank you to the rapporteur for the speech. Social democracy went to the polls at a new ten-year plan for psychiatry. We did the same on the Left side, so it is a wish that we share, that something new should happen, that more should be done. And I would just like to ask the Socialist rapporteur whether the rapporteur is satisfied that that promise has not yet been fulfilled and that there has not even been an initiative by the government. Is the rapporteur satisfied with that, i.e. that nothing has happened?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105414	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105415	I do not agree that nothing has happened and I am satisfied with what has happened. We have given priority to the extra funds every year, i.e. the 600 million. kr. extra to the psychiatry every year. And we now have the technical presentation that the Danish Health Authority and the Danish Social Protection Agency have jointly put in place together with a great many actors and organisations in the field. So we are in a very good place ahead of the negotiations, and I am glad that the Left also agrees that we should have the 10-year plan for psychiatry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105459	Mrs. Jane Heitmann.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105500	In other words, we hear time and again from patient organisations, associations and widely from all over the psychiatry that you are frustrated that nothing is happening and there is no government initiative. Does Mrs. Julie Skovsby understand the frustration of patients, as relatives, as employees, who are experiencing out there, that now the government has been sitting on government staff since 2019 and there has been no difference out there?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105537	Thank you. Mrs. Julie Skovsby, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105538	I understand that we want this area to be lifted up significantly and that the psychiatry must be given priority and treated in the same way as the somatics, and that is what we are doing. Now we have prioritised and found the means, even more than we promised in the election campaign by the Social Democrats. We are also in the process of fulfilling the ten-year plan for psychiatry.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105608	Mrs. Trine Torp, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105610	Well, thank you. Many people with mental illness have non-diagnosed somatic disorders, and there is therefore a risk that diseases affecting death will be overlooked in this context. There is also a risk that deaths caused by drug abuse or overmedication may be overlooked. Does the rapporteur not think that this is a problem of inequality in health?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105637	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105638	I am sure that there is a major problem with inequality in health, and this shows exactly what I said in my rapporteur's speech, that is to say what the SF points out. Mortality is a big, big problem, and it's unfair. The Danish Health Authority has announced that the necessary tools to contribute to knowledge of disease and mortality among patients with severe mental illness are already available. It's from 2009, and it's from 2018. That is the knowledge we must take with us, while also having to have new research and new knowledge.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105725	Mrs. Trine Torp.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105727	Well, then, we will have to look into this a little more closely and ask questions about it in committee, because there is actually a great deal where autopsy brings about a different cause of death from the one we would otherwise have expected. But if we do not have proper knowledge of what people with mental disorders really die of, how are we ever going to change the totally unjust excess mortality we see where they live 15-20 years shorter than other people?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105756	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105758	It is simply binding, I think, that we should have more knowledge and we should have more research in the field of psychiatry and mental disorders. We cannot disagree on that at all. And I am also very pleased that the SF's rapporteur says that let us now work on this in committee and delve a little deeper into the concrete tools and data that are needed in this area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105826	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we go further in the rapporteur's line to Mrs Jane Heitmann, the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519105837	Thank you to the Socialist People's Party for putting forward a relevant and concrete proposal inspired by the recommendations of the Institute for Human Rights and the conclusions of the SURVIVE project on judicial autopsies of people with mental disorders that suddenly and unexpectedly die. A psychiatric diagnosis is often associated with a previous death compared to the rest of the population. Right now men with a mental illness live on average 20 years shorter than the rest of the population, while for women it is 15 years. These are two sad statistics showing how unjustly serious mental illness is. If you want to know something about inequality in health, yes, at least here are the sad figures that speak their clear language. People with mental illness are a difficult target group to reach. Many live irregular lives on the edge of society, and many live on a daily life with high consumption of drugs, abuse, homelessness, and no fixed point or anchor in life. All this can be a shadow for somatic diseases such as AIDS. diabetes or cardiovascular disease is detected in time. There is no doubt that scientific studies on e.g. side effects of medicine and disease development in people with mental disorders will be able to bring new knowledge to light. The Danish Health Authority also points out this in its report • Sudden and unexpected death in patients with mental illness, as it is called, from 2009. And we on the Left do not disagree at all. But it's probably gonna take a little more for now and here if we're gonna break the basket. On the left side, we are quite open to looking at how forensic autopsies and related forensic studies can contribute to the efficient and appropriate provision of new knowledge and data in this field. The SURVIVE project is an old acquaintance. In autopsy of 500 people with recognized or suspected mental illness, results have been found suggesting that drug poisoning can be a major cause of early and unexpected death. As I mentioned earlier, we know that many patients in psychiatry live with concomitant abuse. In fact, more than 40,000 patients in psychiatry have a double diagnosis, i.e. both a mental illness and a simultaneous serious abuse. And unfortunately, the numbers are rising. On the left side, we would like to see a national action plan against abuse drawn up and we would like to see more people with double diagnosis treated at regional level. Unfortunately, the government is sitting on its hands, and people with double diagnosis are the losers. For they fall over and over again between two chairs in the region and the municipality respectively. It is quite incomprehensible that the government does not also have a heartfelt desire for more people to experience a psychiatry that takes care of its patients and that does not just send them around in the system of the monkey on the shoulder to the next perverse counselor or treat. The results of the SURVIVE project indicate that among other things: communication and cooperation across psychiatry and the treatment of abuse do not work well enough. In recent weeks we have heard from many corners of the psychiatry of doctors, researchers, patient associations and organizations that one wonders that the government is slow with the new 10-year plan for psychiatry. And we share in the Left the wonder. We must remember that the Socialist Government went to elections at a new ten-year plan for psychiatry, just as we did on the Left side. But it's like now that the table catches, you run away from all the election promises of a better psychiatry. I know that the Socialist People's Party is also pressing, and I actually welcomed Mrs Pia Olsen Dyhr's question about psychiatry for the Prime Minister during Question Time the other day. The answer, however, was disheartening, because it is as if the Prime Minister has not understood at all how serious the challenges of psychiatric patients and relatives and employees live with. I hope that behind the Prime Minister's vibrant answer there is not a student with that which we have heard from the Prime Minister in a completely different context. On the Left side, we are in favour of examining the possibility of implementing a system that can provide more and better knowledge of data and life expectancy, and we are not opposed to an experimental period of systematic judicial autopsies and related forensic studies. We know, among other things. from the Institute for Human Rights report on the basis of the SURVIVE project that there are many relatives who are left with questions when a mother or a father or a sister or a brother with mental illness dies early or unexpectedly. These are questions which are not being answered today. This can make it difficult to move on in a good way. I hope that we can agree on a joint report and give each other a hand in that we should work on the subject when the Minister for Health calls for negotiations on a new 10-year plan for psychiatry, also because the funding of the proposal refers to the economic scope and with uncertain estimates will cost 30 million. kr. We must have that part examined in greater detail before we can support the proposal from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110352	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a brief comment to Mrs Trine Torp.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110355	Thank you for that, and thank you for accepting the proposal, which is quite specific, and I agree that it does not solve all the challenges of psychiatry, but it is in fact also to see that mental illness is not, after all, something that kills you. You die from the treatment you either get or don't get, and that's what we need to learn more about with any of these things. In fact, I am also aware that the rapporteur mentions the relatives. The minister said it would have great human costs to do these autopsies, and it is hardly because of the deceased, I think, but the relatives. The SURVIVE project actually showed that 90 per cent. by those concerned gave consent to their nearest deceased autopsy, and does it not also show that it is actually significant, not only for our knowledge, but also for the relatives, that we are doing this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110450	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110451	After all, I spoke in my speech saying that it is extremely difficult for some to be left as a relative when a mother or a father or a sister or a brother dies early or unexpectedly. I understand it can be difficult to move on in life in a good way if you can't get maybe not all answers, but just some answers to why it ended up as tragic as it did. And I think we should recognise that there are also relatives who can be left with the desire to get some answers, and that is what the SURVIVE project shows when so many say yes to autopsy for their loved ones.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110532	Trine Torp.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110534	In fact, I think that is an extremely important point, because in addition to the grief that you are experiencing, sometimes it is also very dramatic that there are more questions and lights than there are answers, and that is also why I think it is problematic if you think that we know all that is why people are dying, because I do not believe in that. It was just a comment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110557	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110558	Thank you. I agree that more knowledge is needed, more data is needed, which is why we are also positive about intention, and we would like to discuss it, as I said in my rapporteur's speech, when discussing the next ten-year plan. It is not to know when it will be, but at least it is a theme that we on the Left would also like to be wholeheartedly involved in, precisely how we can gain more knowledge, both so that we can be better able to deal with, but also so that we can do something for the next of kin.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110630	Thank you to the rapporteur. I see no one else wishing to make brief comments. The next rapporteur I see in the Chamber is Mr. Peder Hvelplund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519110648	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to the SF for making this proposal. In the Enhedslisten we are in complete agreement with the intention set out in the proposal, because it is absolutely right that we need more knowledge of this area, and that is also what we have been able to see through the SURVIVE project. I have some reservations about the issue of funding, and I am also a little unclear as to how exactly the boundaries are to be defined, because if we talk about citizens who die with mental illness, that is to say with a diagnosis, it can become a fairly broad group and how we guarantee that demarcation, and how we also ensure that some kind of consent is secured in relation to that being what is happening. At any rate, these are some things I need to clarify in the committee's work. I therefore hope that this is something that we will be able to land in a joint report, because the issue of funding and the question of having it seen in the context of a 10-year psychiatry action plan are, in fact, important, but I think that these are some of the things that we can clarify in committee. Otherwise, I think that this is a really important issue, as the SF points out here, because we really do not know how much effect there is in terms of medication and cause of death for citizens with mental illness, and therefore it is an important theme to discover. Then I would also like to say that I will be a little confused when you hear the debate down here when it comes to the whole area of psychiatry. Because I think this is extremely important, and that is what we think in the Enhedslisten, and that is also why the first Finance Act secured the 600 million. kr. For a lift. At that time, too, and I would like to say that today, we know that this is far from sufficient, but it was a substantial boost, it was permanent funds that came into the budget law, and I think that when we discuss the whole question of psychiatry, there is a little tendency to say that there are a lot of words about the fact that something has to be done now and that something has to be done now, but when it comes to the concrete will to find funding, I think it sometimes lags behind previous governments, but that is also a criticism that I think we can address to the current government. I agree that with the financial means we have given a real boost, but I am deeply, deeply disappointed that we have not started negotiations on a 10-year psychiatry action plan, and I have to say that I simply do not understand it, because there is an excellent technical presentation from the Social Protection Agency and the organisations behind it have praised it, so it is really just a matter of getting started. And when we come to the issue of funding, the government could conveniently get rid of it by having a broad agreement where we get the initiatives prioritised, where we ensure what we have to do first, and then, as political parties, we can be held accountable in financial laws, in relation to how much we deliver on it. It would certainly make it easier for both users and professional and family organisations to answer for why we do not deliver on the psychiatry action plan we have then adopted. However, the premise is that the government is called for these negotiations and that we get the priorities set in motion, so that we do not see what many organisations have also warned against, namely that we are making cherrypicking now we must not use foreign words, but that means that each of us selects our own little hobby-horse in relation to it, but that instead we have a unified plan. So I would like to take this opportunity to make a strong appeal to the government for us to launch negotiations on a 10-year psychiatry action plan so that we can get it delivered as early as the first financial law here. However, as I said, there are a great many positive tactics in this, and there are some challenges to it in terms of funding and in terms of the definition of the target group and the question of consent, which I think we should have clarified, and then I think it would be obvious that we should have a joint report on what will ensure that we can bring it into the negotiations. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111107	If you cannot find a good Danish expression, you can use a single foreign word or short sentence if you translate it. That's the way it is. There is a brief comment on Mrs Jane Heitmann. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111119	Thank you. Thank you, too, to the rapporteur for his speech. After all, I share the rapporteur's astonishment at the lack of initiatives in relation to a 10-year plan. However, I was able to hear that the rapporteur was somewhat surprised by the priorities of the previous government in the field of psychiatry, and I would really just like to ask the rapporteur whether the rapporteur recognises that the former government, among other things, is. In the economic agreement between the government and the regions, a very large amount of money was earmarked for psychiatry, precisely to ensure that the money would go to psychiatry and not, as we have seen with the 600 million. kr., set aside here, that they among others. has gone to repay old lease debts in the Capital Region, if I remember correctly. Does the rapporteur not recognise that when you target the funds, you are sure that they go to psychiatry and not to everything else?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111213	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111215	No, I don't, and I do, among other things. not because I also had the then Minister for Health in consultation about the 2.4 billion. kr., I remember it was as they granted. And that was because the economic agreements were underfunded. This meant that the funds sent out to psychiatry were used to patch holes. And that is why the government simply decorated itself with borrowed feathers in relation to the funds claimed to have been given to psychiatry, for they never had an effect because they did not cover the demography. The money was simply used to patch up the gaps that the general savings made. And that's why I think it's going to sound hollow when the Left is talking today that we're going to give a boost to psychiatry. The Left simply did not deliver on that when the government was in power, and that is why I think that the Left's criticism of the government is going to sound hollow. I agree that the government should be criticised, but to take the course that the Left has taken in the past, taking one hand to patch holes with the other and claiming that a boost has now been given, I think is completely irresponsible.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111313	Mrs. Jane Heitmann.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111314	Well, I guess we can agree that there's a difference between putting off a bag of money and saying go ahead, and so to say, we're gonna drop a bag of money, and this is where they're gonna go. I guess we can agree that there is a difference. And that is what we did, not with all the funds, but with some of the funds in the economic agreement. And I cannot really think that there are precedents in the economic agreement where targeted funds have been set aside in this way. But does the rapporteur not recognise that this is a very different way of allocating money?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111345	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111347	Yes, I would like to acknowledge that there is a significant difference between whether you say that you cover the demography, that is to say that you ensure that you maintain the current level and that you add money, or if you first remove some money and then give it back and say that you have now added some funds. I'm gonna lean to the first model, and that's what we're gonna do, among other things. In the context of the Finance Act it was also targeted funds. We said precisely to the regions where we wanted them to give priority to those funds, and then we left it up to the regions to give concrete effect to those funds. And that is clearly the kind of model I would prefer in future too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111418	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we move on to Mr. Per Larsen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111426	Thank you for that, President. And thank you to SF and Mrs Trine Torp for bringing the psychiatry to debate with an autopsy proposal. I can only agree with the previous rapporteurs that there is good reason to criticise the government for slowing down the negotiations on a new psychiatry plan. For psychiatry has a placemother status in our health services, which we simply cannot be familiar with, and of course something needs to be done about that. That is also why we have been asked to draw up a proposal, and in fact there is a very good proposal which has been praised all around, and I think it is time that we also called for negotiations so that we can get started, because it is quite urgent. We know the challenges in psychiatry. There is too little capacity, too few beds, which means that patients who are not finished are printed daily. We simply cannot be familiar with this. We need to get this right. In fact, we also lack psychiatrists in our psychiatry, and we must, of course, have done something about that. And that's how you can keep doing it. We also lack early detection efforts to prevent adverse disease progression in patients. There are a number of things that are so pressing. Now you make such a fragmented proposal and select a single piece on autopsy, and that can be good in terms of getting some more evidence as to why patients die as early as they do. But as a starting point, I think we should try to see if we can't make an overall plan, because there's also some economy in this, which we have to think about. Are we now spending the money most sensibly by using it for autopsies, or are there perhaps some other options in order to discover why psychiatric patients live a shorter life than people without mental illness do? We are not going to vote in favour of the proposal, but are looking forward to the committee reading. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111655	There is a brief comment to Mrs Trine Torp, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111658	Thank you. That is the nature of the motions for resolutions down here. I also know that the Conservative rapporteur has put forward many proposals on family doctors and others, which are also part of a major debate on health reform, so I think that we all contribute in this way to highlighting some things. I would also say that if we were to wait for something to happen in the negotiations on psychiatry, we would never be able to mention the psychiatry in this Chamber, and I really think it deserves us to do so. So it is, of course, true that it is a fragmented proposal. Apart from that, I would just like to hear what the Conservative rapporteur thinks about the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111738	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111740	I certainly believe that in many ways there is a need for research into psychiatry, but there is the fact that it is so fragmented and that you take a piece out and say that it should now be about autopsy. There could of course be many other studies to find out why psychiatric patients die prematurely, so you could look at their lifecycles and what is happening, and there is no doubt that the medication of patients is a contributing cause. But there may also be some other things that apply. After all, we all know that it is unhealthy if there are no opportunities for activity in the psychiatric area and that people are just being pacified. And there are opportunities to launch some initiatives around the psychiatric housing units and in the psychiatric hospitals, which perhaps should be addressed first.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111841	Trine Torp.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111842	These are the efforts that need to be made, but I know that there are just not so many other types of research that point to the real cause of death, and that is why there are very many registrations in the Cause of Death register, where it says that cause of death is unknown. I just want to hear the Conservative rapporteur: is it satisfactory that we have a group such as the psychiatric patients where we accept is the cause of death of unknown?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111911	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111913	It is then there that I have the approach to it that, if it is the case that the cause of death is described as unknown, then it has to be decided, on the basis of a medical assessment, whether there are any specific conditions that make a patient autopsy or not, rather than going in and making specific legislation in the area where it is said that patients should be autopsyed. There I think there's a difference. As a starting point, I think it should be a doctor who decides whether there should be an autopsy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111947	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments, so we go further in the rapporteur's line to Mr Beyer de Ryke. Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519111954	Thank you. I can fully support what has been said in relation to the need to get to grips with the negotiations on the new psychiatry plan. It has been promised for a long time and we have all been waiting to get started at all. Now we have had a single meeting here, and hopefully much more will happen soon. And then, of course, you could say, well, then it's just that we have to take this up. But I have the experience from in here that if you want something to happen in different areas, you also sometimes have to get to grips with the individual elements of something and say that now we have to do something here if you can't make the big plans. The big plans can take a really, really long time and be really hard to get through with, so I would like to thank SF for bringing up this theme. I believe that everyone who has dealt with people with mental disorders has experienced far too early deaths, and when I read the report from the SURVIVE project, I actually realize how much knowledge we do not have. The first is, of course, that through the project you can find out what the cause of a death is for the sake of the relatives. And that knowledge is also the basis for us to assess whether there is anything in the medical treatment that may have to be thought differently, whether there are combinations of disease and medicine that are unfortunate, and whether there are other things we should be aware of, which are indications of wrong treatment. This is all something that can help to optimise the treatment of living people so that, hopefully, the excess mortality rate can be reduced. There is much that we should be able to do better and as it says: "SURVIVE let the dead benefit the living." The systematic provision of knowledge is extremely important. So in the Danish People's Party we would like to discuss how we can create more about why people with a mental illness die earlier. It may be that we need to look at the funding. The SF is also quite clear about that is part of the discussion. So it might well be that a joint report is the most real way of making progress on this and, as I hear the various rapporteurs, a large majority should actually be able to gather to address and ensure that at least something is done about this, if nothing else. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112202	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next speaker I see in the Chamber is Mrs Liselott Blixt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112227	When there are not so many rapporteurs in the Chamber, it is a little quicker to get up on the platform, and this shows just how seriously we take it when we talk about people with mental illness, and I think that is sad: that we say so much, at least, to the media, and that we promise so much when the debate is up, but that when it comes to the matter, nobody is doing anything. I would like to thank the SF for making the proposal. This is something we have been discussing for so many years. I have been a health rapporteur for many years and remember this discussion. I know that the first time we heard about this project, which started in 2013, in order to look at those who died with a psychiatric disorder, there were some 30 years and 18 years old, very young people who were never autopsied, and the question is whether it is because they are afraid to find out that it is actually the forced treatment with medication that they are subjected to. As Mrs Trine Torp says, it is not the disease that kills; it is many times the treatment. The dead can make us wiser on the living, and then you can add: but we have more to do with people who are not mentally ill. Because something was actually done in 2018, when Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby was Minister for Health. There was legislation that made an autopsy of some more, under 50 years at least, and I would like to look at that when we are going to deal with this proposal, how many more have been autopsied since 2018, and whether it is any psychiatric patients that have been autopsied more of, or whether it is only those who do not have a psychiatric condition. In 2018, there was a unanimous Parliament who said that more people had to be autopsyed and that I was counting on 250 more autopsies, so it's exciting to see if what you did back then has done something, because I think it's an important topic we need to address. It may be that some people think that when you're dead, you're dead, and then you can't do much more, but, as I said earlier, it matters what results you get. When you look at the somatic area, it can be a gene error and that it allows you to treat the children or others in the family who may have the same suffering. We know the same in psychiatry. In fact, we know that there are some people who can tolerate some medicine and others who can tolerate something else, and at the same time we know that many times medicines are applied to medicines. When you become even more ill, it has often been the case that one preparation has been prescribed more without actually knowing what it has to do with the different types of medicine. So I certainly believe that this is something we need to look at, and I am on both the proposal, and here I am speaking on behalf of the whole group, our geese and gasers group, we non-attached; we support the proposal; but we also agree to be able to make a report if there is not a majority, in relation to how we get on with these things, and also ask some questions about what has happened since 1 January 2019, when the new bill that Mrs Ellen Trane Nørby made was put into effect. And for the fact that there are a lot of people talking about how much it costs, I'd say I'm gonna get so mad. Well, one day you can send 600 million. kr. to Ukraine, you can send anything to anyone other than Danes. We are talking here about an estimated 7.5 million. kr. annual. If you had now been able to make an agreement, you might also have been able to get it even cheaper, or what I know, and so have made a strategy for how we get to these things. But to stand by and say that we do not autopsy mentally ill young people, because we do not think we can afford that, I do not think we can be familiar. We support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112631	There is a brief comment to Mrs Trine Torp, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112633	Thank you for that, and it will not be a question, but more of a comment, and thank you for supporting it. In fact, I also find it interesting to go a little further in committee with what the rapporteur says, in other words what we can actually see at the autopsies, for example. This with what you find of differences, if you compare people with psychiatric diagnoses that, after the death, are autopsyed, with those who are not. Or are fewer or more autopsies compared to the total increase in the number of people with mental disorders? What about it? And who is it that refers to autopsy? I think we could at least work together on such things, in other words on what kind of questions should be asked.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112718	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112719	I'm really glad. I think it is important, and I also think it is important to look at how the medicine works. I have often wondered when we have been out with section 71, where we have also been told that not all people react to a certain kind of medicine. We know that people who come from other countries and who have a different skin colour from us are taking up medicine in a different way and you do not know why. Well, this is a welcome opportunity to ask if we can't look into this. We're told so much by the dead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112751	Mrs. Trine Torp? No, there are no more brief remarks. But then it is Mrs Trine Torp, SF, as rapporteur for the proposers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519112809	Thank you for the floor and thank you for the debate. I am, of course, annoyed that the government is of the opinion that these systematic medical examinations should not be introduced under the extended autopsy protocol for a two-year period. I welcome the support from several places in relation to the intention of the proposal and the fact that some funding etc. can be discussed, but that in fact, as I listened to it, there was both a response from the Left, from the Enhedslisten, from the Danish People's Party and from Mrs Liselott Blixt in relation to trying to continue with a report. I think that could be really nice. Autopsies contribute with important knowledge of causes of death. In the case of a death where no autopsy is carried out, the data on the cause of death will be derived solely from the general or judicial coronation of the deceased, and in these cases the data are based on estimates. The main argument for performing autopsies is to qualify the long-standing debate that has taken place, namely whether people with psychiatric diagnosis die from the treatment they receive or the one they do not receive. The only thing that can give an answer to that is a forensic autopsy including toxicology. Systematic coronerial autopsies can provide us with important knowledge about risk factors for sudden and unexpected death and thus also knowledge about the causes of excess mortality among people with mental disorders, for example. knowledge of how often medical treatment is either the main cause of death or has contributed to it, and also about the interaction between medical treatment and other risk factors such as: abuse and lifestyle diseases. With more autopsies, we will also be able to reduce the number of deaths recorded with unknown cause of death, thereby helping to ensure better knowledge of the causes of premature death among people with mental disorders. Several, including the Minister, refer to the fact that the necessary tools to contribute to the knowledge of disease and mortality among patients with a mental illness are already available without further use of autopsies. However, it is based on research findings that were known before SURVIVE. However, the government is not looking at the results of the SURVIVE project, and I am surprised. I think that we should allow ourselves to become wiser, starting from what we know today, and not from what we knew earlier. I am therefore also annoyed that the government does not relate to the results of the SURRIVE project and other research. Several international studies show that there are significant discrepancies between the clinical diagnosis prior to death and the subsequent autopsy results, and a Norwegian study indicates that the results of autopsies largely lead to changes in the first recorded cause of death. For example, autopsies of people with mental illness show. heart failure, chronic lung disease, liver disease, which had not been diagnosed before. Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases as a registered cause of death can after all cover up poisoning or heart rhythm disorders, which are known side effects of psychopharmaceuticals. Measures have been taken to avoid over-medication, medical errors, etc. and thus reduce excess mortality among people with mental disorders. This applies, among other things, to: The project Secure Psychiatry, and these are important actions. But unfortunately, as things stand today, these initiatives do not contribute with increased knowledge and data on the relationship between medical treatment and the excess mortality of patients in psychiatric care. It is therefore not monitored whether the initiatives in question are working and whether the professional guidance and recommendations in this area are being complied with. In this way, no data will be provided to monitor developments and thereby monitor whether the initiatives in question contribute to reducing the number of deaths related to drug poisoning. A system of systematic medical autopsies can contribute that knowledge and data, and finally there is also a human aspect, which several people have mentioned, in relation to the relatives we should consider. Autopsies contribute substantial knowledge of the cause of death to the deceased's survivors. Among many survivors there is a great need to clarify the cause of the death of their loved ones, and most often they consent to an autopsy. The Minister has rejected the proposal, among other things. because of human costs. But the SURVIVE project showed that 90%. of the relatives were willing to consent to autopsy. I look forward to the government embarking on the long-awaited negotiations on the 10-year plan for mental health and better efforts for people in mental illness, including getting rid of the inequality and excess mortality that we see. I am therefore also surprised that there is no support to be wiser in this, even if we have to discuss funding, but some kind of response to it. But hopefully it can be part of the debate. More knowledge about the consequences of psychopharmaceutical treatment could help to counter premature death among people with mental illness, and that is the knowledge I think it is worth getting. I look forward to the further discussions in committee and hope that we can find a way to become wiser together and also to produce a report that can make us more aware of the early and unexpected deaths of people with mental illness. I think we have joint responsibility for this, we owe it to the patients, and we owe it to the relatives. Thank you for the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519113426	Thank you. No one else has asked for the floor and the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Health Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519113439	I would point out that the vote on any proposals for adoption will be postponed until Thursday 2 June 2022.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519113643	First of all, I would like to give the floor to Mrs Liselott Blixt, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519113650	Thank you very much. In 1998, the Danish Parliament decided to set up the Knowledge and Research Centre for Alternative Treatment, also known as ViFAB, to gather knowledge of alternative treatment and thereby strengthen knowledge of different forms of alternative treatment and their impact, to strengthen research in the field and to promote dialogue between health professionals, alternative practitioners and users. The Centre did a great and rewarding job, and we can all thank the Danish People's Party Birthe Skaarup for the fact that it started and that funds were constantly set aside for the Centre's research. In fact, social democracy has previously supported the Centre when you go back in history and look and have been given funds for it. But the last time, when the Social Democratic Party had the Prime Minister's post, it was decided to close ViFAB and replace it with a smaller setup in the Danish Medicines Agency; and even though there are a lot of Danes who make use of alternative treatment and find it difficult to find out what is up and down the many offers that exist. Now even doctors and patient associations are shouting that you should look to Norway and see how their knowledge centre works. And that is why we in our non-attached group are proposing that we now get a knowledge centre back up and running again. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519113827	Thank you for the explanatory statement. Then I will give the floor to the Minister for Health for an answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519113836	Thank you. The question which has just been raised here is about setting up an independent knowledge centre for alternative treatment; an institution to ensure research into and disseminate knowledge on alternative treatment and natural medicine. And I understand that the reason for the question is a proposal which has been put forward by the Medical Association, the Medical Associations, DLVS, and Danske Patients. And it is a proposal which basically aims to strengthen patient safety and patient safety through the use of alternative practitioners. This should be done by providing patients and healthcare professionals with access to research-based knowledge and advice on alternative treatments. So that's among other things. patient safety, which is a theme here. It is an important theme and it is important to give it a high priority. In other words, the intention behind the question is also something that I and the government share. We must also recognise that there can be patient safety benefits in setting up such a centre. If, however, we are not where we can support the proposal itself, it is due to a number of such crucial factors. Firstly, that the critics of the question did not give an economic estimate of the cost to a centre. This cannot be done without funding for it. Nor have we received any necessary concrete funding for the establishment or operation of the Centre, and there must therefore be an economic framework; we must find the means. Furthermore, we already have a framework for patient safety for consumers of alternative treatment, and I would like to explain the reasons for this. First of all, economics. It does not appear so precisely what specific tasks such a centre would have here or how it is thought that such a centre would be manned. There's gotta be employees there. And that is probably why the proposal here does not estimate what it will cost to set up such a centre. So it is a little difficult to say yes or no when we do not know the exact content and the economy behind it. In other words, the economy seems unsolved and it makes it difficult to commit to setting up such a centre. If you then go into the initiative that I mentioned in my introduction and that the Medical Association and the Medical Society and Danske Patients have presented, then they recommend that you look to Norway for inspiration, because there is actually a Norwegian knowledge centre for alternative treatment. And according to that proposal, the Norwegian centre was financed with a grant of DKK 10 million, and it gets a 12-14 million in annual grants. That is to say, if it is on the level we are, then it is an expenditure that has to be financed, and the proposal here does not indicate how the creation and operation should be financed. That is why it may be a good proposal, but the rule must be that when you have a proposal, no matter how good it is, we also need to find out where the money for it should come from. But then let us look at the substance itself. Because, as I mentioned at the outset, we already have a framework for patient safety in alternative treatment. Firstly, we have the so-called RAB scheme. It is an industry-managed registration system and the purpose of the RAB is to strengthen safety when using alternative treatment. And when you choose a RAB processor as a patient, you can be sure that the treatment provider meets a number of requirements including: education, ethics and good clinical practice. So it's industry-managed. At the same time, the patient has access to complain about a RAB processor. And where do you do that? Yes, that is exactly what the industry is doing, that is, the association that has registered the processor. So that's one thing. Then, of course, we also have the Board of Patient Safety Board for Alternative Treatment, which is what is then called SRAB and which performs a central role in providing knowledge about alternative treatment to citizens and patients and health professionals. At the same time, the Council is the main central forum for cooperation between alternative practitioners and the relevant authorities. It also involves an important task of bridging the gap between alternative treatment and the more established health system. In addition, of course, it is also the case that all alternative healthcare providers are subject to rules on the marketing of healthcare, and this means that the marketing of healthcare by an alternative treatment provider must be based on professional and relevant information. That information shall not be defective, improper, incorrect or misleading. And the alternative practitioner in question must be able to prove the accuracy of factual information. And if the marketing is contrary to the rules, the Patient Safety Management Board may require that the placing on the market be discontinued or corrected. Overshooting of these rules may result in a fine. Then there are also elements of research to which I would just like to add a few words. This is, of course, an essential part of the work of a knowledge centre, and I have to say that it is not the case that, up to now, there is no research into alternative treatment because there is no centre. Under the Finance Act 2016 and 2018, under the previous government, I recognise that a pool was created that set aside funds for research into alternative treatment. Research has focused on bridge-building between treatment in the established healthcare system and alternative treatment methods. And since the implementation of the funds from the Finance Act, there has been a revival of the pool because there were funds left from last year, and those funds were translated at the end of 2021 into new research projects in alternative treatment. And those projects have among other things. focus on the development and implementation of person-oriented dialogue on alternative treatment in cancer treatment courses and on the focus on alternative treatment among people with chronic pain. And those projects start in June of this year actually. Then it is also the centre that I mentioned, which is located in Norway and from which a Danish centre should seek inspiration. I fully agree that we should seek inspiration wherever we can and where it makes sense in a Danish context. And that is why, of course, we must also reap the knowledge that we can and benefit from all the knowledge that already exists and learn more about the research that saw among other things. is carried out in Norway and, I believe, in other countries. And since Norway has this knowledge centre that carries out research and generates knowledge, it's obvious that we use this research in Denmark, so you don't have to do exactly the same in each country, but can share results and experiences. And then it is important that the Norwegian experience is passed on to the users in Denmark. Among other things, it could. The Danish Agency for Patient Safety or SRAB's website provides links to give the Danes access to Norway's research in alternative treatment instead of necessarily setting up similar or competing centres in Denmark. I think that would be common sense. So to sum up: there is no funding for where the money for this proposal should come from, nor is there a one-sided and clear health-care added value, and for these reasons we believe that no further work can be done on setting up such a knowledge centre for alternative treatment. That is why we cannot support the proposal. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519114701	Thank you. One brief comment from the rapporteurs is now available. The first rapporteur is Mrs Liselott Blixt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519114707	Thank you very much. This proposal clearly shows the difference between you and us or between the different parties on how to prevent and how to help people. Both this proposal and the previous proposal on the autopsy of people with a mental illness show that someone may want to help in a different way than just making bans where the state must decide how to live one's life. Does it not impress the Minister at all that doctors, experts, medical companies and patient organizations have been screaming about this over the last few years and saying that they need a place to gain knowledge from?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519114749	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519114751	In other words, the first introductory remarks I regard as such a political mark, and I do not know whether I should take the time to reply to that. I totally disagree with that presentation, but I think the rapporteur is aware of that, so we should not just leave it at that and then get to the point. Yes, it makes an impression, and that is also why I mentioned it in my speech, i.e. that it applies both to patients' organisations, but also to medical companies, it makes an impression on me. Let us therefore see what they have in Norway, what they have of experience. I am not sure that it would be wise for all countries to have such a research centre in all countries that we normally compare ourselves to the research centre that did research in the same thing and did the same thing. Let's see if we can get some of the knowledge passed on to Denmark. It is also about getting more focus on the bridge building and the communication between the traditional health care and the alternative treatment, in relation to what it can provide.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519114851	Thank you. The next brief remark is to Mr. Peder Hvelplund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519114856	Thank you for that and thank you to the Minister for the speech. After all, there is now a very large proportion of the population who are using alternative treatment. Therefore, I would just like to hear from the Minister whether it is not the Minister's view in principle that we should ensure a greater degree of safety for those sections of the population who use alternative treatments. I mean, it could be one of those things. be through the creation of a knowledge and research centre which could both provide new knowledge, but could also help coordinate the research efforts that are taking place, and in general also have a look at the whole RAB scheme, so that we can make better demands on training, control and replacement access so that citizens are not in doubt when they go into a place where there is a RAB processor, so that they know which rules they are covered by, both in relation to training requirements, for compensation and so on. Then the Minister does not agree in principle that we could actually strengthen this whole area, among other things. through the creation of a knowledge and research centre?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519114959	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115001	Yeah, you could. I also think I was trying to explain the government's position on this. Some might think that this is a harmful proposal. At least I don't think so. There are certainly some elements in the proposal itself where there is a financing problem. Then I also mentioned that, in this way, there are some current elements which at least take care of part of what such a centre should do, among other things. The RAB scheme, which is being asked here. You can always look at it and adjust it. I myself have been a part of that, and we can easily do that, i.e. adjust further. But we also need to recognise that there are limits to what we can achieve with such a system. It is the industry itself that stands for it, and I think that is healthy and good. However, if we leave the definition of what one type of alternative treatment would require and what the other and third types would require to a public control body, then I think we would have some very, very big problems, and we should at least think very far ahead if we go that way, because there I see some problems right in front of us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115106	The next question is Mr. Stinus Lindgreen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115109	Thank you for that, and thank you for your speech. The Minister mentions, among other things: the ViFAB and also the existing SRAB, which now takes care of this area in a Danish context. I share many of the views expressed by the Minister here from the platform, but I would like to know whether the Minister has looked at some of the projects which we have publicly funded in Denmark via ViFAB and other sources. The Minister mentioned that there are some unused funds that were re-examined, but does the Minister have an overview of the number of projects that have been completed, what they have come to, whether they have published their results, whether they have become wiser by the money we have actually spent since the creation of the ViFAB until today?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115147	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115148	That's a very good question. It is too early to make the evaluation of it, because, as I said, the last projects are starting because of the reprint it is correct here in June. I cannot just remember exactly when they expire, but it is quite obvious to both the public, but not least to the parties who have to negotiate it, to look at whether this is a road to go further. Because the fact that something is good and sympathetic to have a closer look at it also means that we need to find out whether it is the right way to investigate it and whether we can actually use those results for anything. I think this is an area where you just have to say it was that too, sir. Peder Hvelplund previously stated that there are many, many patients in Denmark who use our traditional health care, but who also use some form of alternative treatment. And it is very, very important that the public health service is aware of this and that you do not, as a patient, say that you would rather not tell your doctor about it, because it is an alternative treatment, and it may end up harming you. There you have to be comfortable that there is understanding for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115253	Thank you. There are no more brief comments, so we thank the Minister. We shall now proceed to the debate and to the general rules for short remarks. First of all, I would like to give the floor to the rapporteur for the questioners, Mrs Liselott Blixt, outside the groups.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115310	Thank you. Well, I do love these proposals, where we can really show that we are not the same in here, even though there are some citizens who think that we can all be a little in the middle, no matter what the question is, and if there is something I have fought for next to Birthe Skaarup in all my years as health rapporteur for the Danish People's Party, it is alternative treatment and that, and that we ensure citizens a sense of where they can go when they need treatment. That is why I also mentioned VIFAB and Birthe Skaarup, who was the one who made it run. And with regard to the money that the minister was saying was dropped off in 2016-2018, you can guess who dropped them off, and we shouldn't point that far. The minister says there's a lack of funding. Well, it's the minister's own government who took the money. I would be pleased that that money was returned and I can easily find 10 million. kr. a year in a budget, because there are some things that the Minister does, which I do not agree with, and this just shows that we have different policies and positions in different areas. And it's nice to know that I can go out and say to the citizens of Denmark that I would like to increase their safety by knowing where to turn if it is that they want to take matters into their own hands and use a dietary supplement or an alternative treatment; or that we can drop some research money off. We had just been doing this for a very long time, and a great many projects came out of it. Stinus Lindgreen will ask me; I am a mind reader and there are projects. Some may show that there was not so much, and others show that it was worth using acupuncture, for example. births or other pain relief. You can then discuss what is placebo and what is not, but it is just shown in the projects that it works on someone. And that's research, and sir. Stinus Lindgreen also knows that research results depend on the eyes that see. VIFAB was closed by the Social Democratic Government and I think it was with help from the Enhedslisten and Radicals. I know that the SF was against it, and I am sorry that you are not on our proposal for adoption because you actually fought to preserve things as they were. I also know that there has been a former rapporteur who has actually proposed that we should return this money and have VIFAB stand up again, but unfortunately there was no majority in favour of it. For there are very many people who like to use complementary treatment, as you also call it, where you complement what we get in health care, with food supplements, natural medicine, acupuncture and some other alternative treatment, but they have nowhere to go. As a health rapporteur, I have been sitting here many times when we have had cases of people going to some doctor who says: I can treat cancer, and then they actually got even sicker; or that people have gone abroad and have had a stem cell treatment to cure them for all sorts or sclerosis. You can't get that knowledge the way it is today. Today, you rely on googling on your PC, and then something comes out. And what do you do when you're sick? You resort to what is nearest to you without really being able to verify that this is something you have to stay away from, or that there are some projects here that say that it is not harmful, but maybe not beneficial, but it might be that it was good. In other words, a place to go is the Food and Agriculture Authority, where there is little to look at, about food supplements etc., but there they do not have the alternative treatment in other areas. So I think it is important that we establish a knowledge centre. How to do that is, of course, the question, but what we have today, sir. President. - The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: We want a more established system where some information can also be sought. Fortunately, we do not agree, for the experts also think so, Danske Patients and, as mentioned earlier, Medical Societys. They also say that sometimes they face some challenges, for example. in connection with people in pain. We also know that medical cannabis is a new alternative that has come up. Well, damn it, I don't swear, I don't think that's a swearing word, but couldn't we try to see how we could do better? For me, this is prevention. It can also save some money in health care by actually creating a centre where we can both inform, share knowledge and put some projects into the lake. So, of course, I'm hoping for backup. I have the following proposals for adoption, I would like to read out, and it is on behalf of Liselott Blixt (UFG), Martin Geertsen (V), Per Larsen (KF), Jens Henrik Thulesen Dahl (DF), Susanne Zimmer (FG), Karina Adsbøl (UFG), Lise Bech (UFG), Bent Bøgsted (UFG), Marie Krarup (UFG) and Hans Kristian Skibby (UFG): Proposals for adoption The Danish Parliament notes that there is a continuous need to improve the dialogue between doctor and patient in the Danish healthcare system, including the possibility of obtaining knowledge about alternative treatment. Patients and doctors demand a knowledge center to better navigate in the field of alternative treatment. For this reason, the Danish Parliament instructs the government at the request of the Danish Medical Association and Danske Patients and others. to explore the possibility of establishing a knowledge centre to make knowledge more accessible to the Danes using alternative treatment and to help prevent damage and errors associated with alternative treatment. In this context, the Government is required to draw up a statement which will include international experience, possible organisation, economic conditions relating to a knowledge centre, etc., and, on this basis, to convene political parties for discussion. • V 87). Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115919	Thank you. And as foretold, of course, there is a question from Mr. Stinus Lindgreen, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519115927	Thank you. After all, I thought, encouraged by the rapporteur, that I had to say something. The rapporteur mentions this, I think, as the rapporteur also mentioned in our debate on acupuncture that acupuncture was supposed to have an effect at birth. This leads me to ask the rapporteur, as the rapporteur sits down and reads scientific articles, whether the rapporteur notices how well-controlled a study is, whether there is a placebo group, and whether the rapporteur also looks at existing knowledge in this area, in other words all the other studies of the same treatment. For that is well known, and I assume that the rapporteur agrees that the overall evidence in one area must of course be looked at before conclusions are drawn. It is rarely one study that revolves around decades of research.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120005	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120008	I would like to say first of all that I am a layman; I am not a scientist like Mr. Stinus Lindgreen. I've also been to China and seen what they're doing, and they're using it as pain relief. They use it for giving birth to women, so they're free from giving blockades and all sorts of other things. There is also a difference in how to research. I know you guys are looking at some papers and extracting something. I mean, I talk to people and I ask, how are you? Does that help you? Yeah. You know what, keep going.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120035	Follow-up questions from Mr. Stinus Lindgreen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120037	Thank you. It is, of course, important, especially when we talk about this type of treatment, to talk to patients and to hear what the experienced effect is. Nevertheless, numerous studies have in fact also been made of Chinese practice, where one can see whether acupuncture actually has the pain relief effect as it is claimed. And I can tell you here that the rapporteur will probably be disappointed if the rapporteur sits down and reads these studies. Now both the rapporteur and the Minister mentioned ViFAB, and then I would like to hear: does the rapporteur think that when we have publicly funded studies, the results of these studies, whether positive or negative, should also be published?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120109	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120110	Yeah. I think we should do the same in relation to vaccines. Well, sometimes we hide those side effects of vaccines, too oh, no, then somebody chooses them from. Why is this not the case in all areas? I believe that, no matter what, there must be openness. We must have effects, side effects and real opportunities. We also need to know that if we take an alternative treatment, it may be the placebo effect it may also be that it works. We don't know much. But I think it is important because we know that there are so many people who use it and exactly acupuncture uses even the doctors after all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120143	Thank you. There are no more questions, so I would like to thank the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Rasmus Horn Langhoff of the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120154	Thank you. Today's question here is based on a proposal to set up a knowledge centre for alternative treatment as far as I can understand with inspiration from Norway, where a national research centre has been established in the field of complementary and alternative medicine. It will be interesting to follow Norwegian experience. In relation to the question of whether we should now set up a knowledge centre for alternative treatment in Denmark, I am not sure that this is the right way to go. The management of Patient Safety is already focusing on alternative treatment. Today, the agency offers a register system for registering as an association, so that members can call themselves registered alternative practitioners. It gives citizens something to navigate by if you want to choose an alternative treatment. Then it is also known that the person concerned meets a number of educational and professional requirements and that there is a possibility of redress. If you are in doubt, you can at least decide whether or not the alternative practitioner is in the register. The Board also has advice on alternative treatment, such as: is responsible for conveying knowledge about the alternative treatment area to the rest of the health care system; that is, some of what a knowledge centre would also have to promise. Nor is a knowledge centre a prerequisite for research into alternative treatment. Alternative treatment is already being studied today, including: funding for research into alternative treatment has been provided by several stages of the Finance Act. It is also important that the Patient Safety Management Authority does not consider that the current model presents challenges to patient safety. I should also like to point out that the proposal lacks funding. It's a general thing, not just today, and it may be, it's a boring argument, but if things aren't funded, they won't happen. So it does not make sense to propose things where funding is not allocated, because then it will not happen. It is not free to set up a centre, it is not free to operate a centre, nor a centre for alternative treatment. So, as the proposal now stands, such a knowledge centre should either not become something if it is adopted because there is no money, or it should then be financed through cuts elsewhere in the health sector. We will not support that. But basically the Social Democratic Party cannot support the proposal here We have a text for adoption on behalf of the Social Democratic Party and the SF, which I would like to read out: Proposals for adoption The Danish Parliament considers it essential that users can safely avail themselves of alternative practitioners. A decision to set up a knowledge centre should be based on knowledge of the added value of patient safety, as well as a clear condition that the necessary funding is provided. The Danish Parliament recognises that the centre could bring certain patient safety benefits, but notes that patient safety, research and dissemination are already being carried out by the Patient Safety and SRAB Board. The Danish Parliament does not find it unequivocally established that the centre will provide this sufficient added value for patient safety. The Danish Parliament also notes that the proposal will entail expenditure and that the necessary concrete funding is not indicated. On the basis of these considerations, the Danish Parliament finds that no further work should be done on the establishment of an independent knowledge centre for alternative treatment, but asks the Ministry of Health to examine whether there are evaluations from the Centre in Norway and whether knowledge from the Centre in Norway can be used in Denmark. • V 88).
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120536	Thank you. There is one brief comment. Mrs. Liselott Blixt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120541	Thank you very much. I mean, it's so boring to always hear a Social Democrat come after the minister, because that's exactly the same speech being made. I'll start with the funding. I believe that the money I pay in tax, the citizens pay in tax, must go to Danish citizens and those who live in Denmark as Danish citizens. Everything else should not be given money. Then we can start prioritising the Danes and the Danes' health, and that there are plenty of money there. But does it not impress the rapporteur that doctors and specialists would like us to have a knowledge centre? It refers to the Health Authority and the Ministry, but I do not hear what the rapporteur himself thinks either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120629	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120630	Well, of course it makes an impression, just as it makes an impression that the Board of Patient Safety is today carrying out this task and does not think that there will be a patient safety added value in setting up such a centre. So, of course, it makes an impression, even when some people think otherwise than I do. One who thinks the same thing as I do is my party colleague, who is Minister for Health, so perhaps it is not quite so shocking that we are, I would say, almost always in line, especially when we stand here on the platform. Then I would like to say that I fully agree with the rapporteur now I do not know what the official term is in that the funding, let us be honest, is boring. It's boring. The funny thing is to buy things, the boring thing is to pay the bill, but the reality is that, unfortunately, you have to.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120734	Mrs. Liselott Blixt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120736	I think the more boring thing is that you always have a lot of money to give to other countries in need, foreign aid and Ukraine, and of course we have to help, but as soon as it comes to Danish citizens, the box is closed. This is prevention, and it's actually something that could help our healthcare system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120757	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120758	Of course, what has been said here has nothing to do with reality, that is, as soon as it comes to Danish citizens, the box is closed. What I'm calling for is that when you want to spend money, find a sense of what this is costing money and then tell me what it is and how this bill is going to be paid. And if the rapporteur wants it to be taken from the aid given to Ukraine, or it has to be taken from the health system or taken from something quite different, write it, and then at least you have a proposal that has a chance to become a reality if it is voted through.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120835	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment to Mr. Stinus Lindgreen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120839	Thank you. I shall be very brief and stick to the boring part, namely the funding here. I agree with the rapporteur on the platform that it is not the case that we give priority only to the health of all kinds of people other than the Danes. We are sitting, for example. and negotiate health reform these very days. I would like to ask the rapporteur: if the rapporteur now found that it was 10-12 million a year that it would cost to run this centre, would the rapporteur give priority to using them for alternative treatment, or could there perhaps be other areas of health care that were in need more?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120910	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120911	The first 12 million I stumble over will not be invested in such a centre here, and the first billion I stumble over will not necessarily come by here either. There are very many places that call for more funds in the health sector, but also very much for more labour. So we're challenged in every way, and we have to do better in every way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120939	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. We thank the rapporteur. And then we welcome Mr. Martin Geertsen from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519120949	Thank you for the floor. May I not start by saying that I think it is with an impressive enthusiasm that the government and the Social Democratic Government are throwing themselves at state finances. It almost seems like it's gonna be a welfare sactress in this country, if you set up this knowledge center, so it's not worse, is it? And without revealing the cover for these health negotiations, it might be possible to say that there too there might be a need for you to botany what you spend money on in relation to all sorts of working groups, task forces, commissions, and what do I know about money that you could spend on all sorts of other parts of the Danish health service. I would like to thank Mrs Liselott Blixt and the other non-attached Members who have raised this debate on an independent knowledge centre for alternative treatment. As has rightly been pointed out, this is something that several organisations have wanted, and I can do so, among other things. mention organisations such as the Medical Association, Medical Associations and Danske Patients. In addition, as has also been pointed out, there is a place in the world, Norway, from which one can be inspired: the Norwegian NAFKAM, which is an independent knowledge centre that shares knowledge on as neutral a basis as possible. For us in the Left, it is fundamentally important that a knowledge centre should arise at some point, and I can sense that not being right now should neither promote nor impede alternative treatment, but rather be a knowledge centre that conveys knowledge on as objective and neutral a basis as possible. We in the Left are deeply concerned about patients and, of course, about ensuring them the best possible treatment and strengthening patients' rights, and in this respect I noted in particular the study carried out by the University of Southern Denmark on behalf of the Arthritis Association, which says that half of the patients with osteoarthritis or back problems have used, whether you like it or not, Mr. Stinus Lindgreen, alternative medicine or alternative treatment. And that is why we actually share a bit of the concern that there is and that more people travel, including the organisations mentioned, know that neither patients nor healthcare professionals can go somewhere and get proper information and advice about the alternative treatment. Because they use it. So in reality, we think that the patient is left a little alone with all these choices, and I think there is reason to question whether it is sustainable. Now you can take the quotes from the Board of Patient Safety's comments as you like and take out what you can use in your argument, but I note at least that you are relatively positive about such a knowledge centre. On the other hand, of course, we need to be aware of the concerns that exist, and it is of course important in the creation of such a knowledge centre that we do not just come to because we have a knowledge centre, that blue-stamping treatments, without being well elucidated in advance. In that case, it can actually help to give patients the idea that it is safe and good treatment that is at issue here, even though it is, indeed, not very well illustrated. Therefore, we also agree with the Patient Safety Agency when they point out that such a knowledge centre should be based as a real research institution at university level, so we ensure that we are not going to give patients and other healthcare professionals seriously wrong advice. Then the funding has been said to the Minister and the Socialist rapporteur and, of course, it must always be in place. Having said that, we can see that in Norway it costs up to 14 million Norwegian kroner, and I cannot stand here on the platform and convert it, but it is hardly any farm in Norwegian kroner to establish it, at least if you had to take such a Norwegian model. And if you imagine that a Danish knowledge centre is about that level, then I think we should try to see if we can't engage in some kind of dialogue about it across the parties. So, to pick up, I would say that we in the Left really think it is a quite fine text for adoption, as we ourselves have been involved in putting our minimal stamp on the fact that the government is making a statement on this, including looking at the economy, and then inviting the parties to a discussion on this issue. But it is also clear, of course, that if a majority in this Parliament is violently opposed to the government making a statement on this and that we come to the minister and discuss it, then of course there is nothing to do about it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519121434	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur is Mrs Kirsten Normann Andersen, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519121445	Thank you for that, and also thank you from me to the authors of this question debate, which is about whether the government will ensure an independent knowledge centre for alternative treatment. In fact, it is also an old SF proposal. In Denmark, we have previously had a knowledge and research centre for alternative treatment. We later received the RAB-scheme, a website where patients and relatives could get information about alternative treatment, which together with the Danish Health Authority's Council on Alternative Treatment, SRAB, has been responsible for knowledge sharing and contact with the various associations and alternative practitioners and the Danish Health Authority. If anyone runs mad in all these letters, I understand. Because there's a lot of them in this exact area. However, the RAB scheme was closed, and now there is no place to gather sufficient information about alternative treatment in Denmark. In the SF, it is untenable that there is insufficient control and knowledge sharing of alternative treatment, among other things. Because many patients today are using alternative and complementary treatment. Therefore, we would also like to see a knowledge centre for alternative treatment similar to the Norwegian NAFKAM, which researches alternative and complementary treatment and is responsible for critical knowledge sharing in the area of good and evil. As I said, this is an old SF proposal, but concrete action, as proposed in the question here, also requires funding and priority. We don't have a bid for that. However, we believe it makes sense to have an overview of what we know, how that knowledge can be used better in practice, an overview of the need for more and better control and knowledge sharing for patients. We have agreed with the Socialists to formulate ourselves out of a joint proposal for adoption, which is why the Socialist People's Party also supports the adoption text. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519121706	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Stinus Lindgreen, Radical Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519121714	Thank you very much, President, and thank you to Mrs Liselott Blixt for raising this issue for debate in this Chamber. It is always nice to have the opportunity to discuss alternative treatment. As you know, the proposal is to establish an independent knowledge centre with alternative treatment in Denmark, and the construction is inspired by a joint project by Danske Patients and the Medical Association and leans on the Norwegian NAFKAM model. To start with the boring part, so that it is, like, out of the world, I would say that unfunded proposals in themselves are of course a little difficult to support, and with the challenges we are currently facing in the field of health, I myself will not begin to give priority to health in order to set up exactly this centre, because there are in my view other areas that are much more important. That said, sir, that is absolutely right. Martin Geertsen, that there are a great many Danes who use different forms of alternative treatment • it is obvious when you look at the figures. The interest is there, and therefore it is also clear that these consumers of alternative treatment need to find knowledge about the different treatments. At the same time, and this is at least as important, doctors should know how to talk to their patients about alternative treatment, not to recommend alternative treatment, but to understand what their patients are using, as this may affect the real treatment that patients are also receiving. There are, of course, examples of such things as: herbal medicine can interact negatively with chemotherapy, so it's important knowledge to get there. Therefore, trusting, open communication between patient and physician is extremely important in this area too. How to do that is not trivial, I fully acknowledge that. In Denmark, we have previously had ViFAB • Knowledge and Research Centre for Alternative Treatment which existed between 2000 and 2012. Over the years they distributed just under 19 million. kr. to a total of 35 research projects, and the latest figures I have just been able to dig up before the debate here today show that only 14 of the projects have reported their results, and only 6 of these 14 have published their results in actual scientific journals. Even if you do not relate to the somewhat fluctuating quality of the projects themselves, it is rather problematic with research glasses that the results of publicly funded projects are not presented even after they have been completed. Here it is important to stress that negative results are also important and should be reported. The mistake that was made at the time was that the necessary academic quality and balance were not ensured in the centre, and therefore a number of very dubious projects were put into the lake. Nor do I share the view which has been expressed here that SRAB is functioning optimally, so I fully agree with the comments that have been made, among others. The Enhedslisten's rapporteur earlier, namely that one should look at the area, even if one might come to it from a slightly different angle. That there is a need for the dissemination of objective knowledge of alternative treatments for both patients and healthcare professionals, I fully agree. I also agree with the authors of the motion that, if action is to be taken, it must be an academically based centre with good scientific practice. But whether the solution is to establish a Danish centre can be discussed. Today there is an incredible amount of research in this area, and I can recommend my fellow rapporteurs to go out and look at what exists decades of research in this area, and this was summed up, among other things. The co-operation of Cochrane, which also has a Danish centre, like they in Norway with the much-mentioned NAFKAM centre do exactly the same thing, namely collect and disseminate knowledge about alternative treatments. It's the same knowledge we need, so there may not be a need to start from scratch. After all, the good thing about research is that the results apply wherever research has been carried out, and here I naturally assume that research lives up to good scientific practice. So we do not come from the Radical Left to support the proposal. On behalf of the Radical Left and Liberal Alliance, I would like to make the following points: Proposals for adoption The Danish Parliament notes that a large proportion of the population are using alternative treatments. The Danish Parliament therefore agrees that objective knowledge is needed so that patients can find information about evidence of efficacy and side effects and healthcare professionals can better advise in relation to other ongoing treatment. The Danish Parliament notes that there are already decades of international research in this field and that the conclusions are summarised by among others the Cochrane cooperation and the Norwegian NAFKAM. The Folketing does not see the need for separate funding for research into alternative treatment, but believes that these research projects must apply for funds on an equal footing with all others. The Danish Parliament notes that no funding is given for the start-up or operation of a Danish knowledge centre on alternative treatment, and that this will therefore be at the expense of other health services. The Folketing does not agree with this priority. Parliament cannot therefore support this request. • V 89). Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122153	Thank you for that and there is one brief comment. Mrs Liselott Blixt, outside the groups, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122200	Thank you very much. I know, sir. Stinus Lindgreen has always opposed it and wanted to close everything called the knowledge centre, and I think the RAB scheme should also be drowned down. But I am thinking of: what are the thoughts of those people who would like to have treatment outside the public health service? Do you mean that you just have to let them sail their own lake, because when we don't have evidence of it, we shouldn't offer it either? Is that what the rapporteur stands for?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122231	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122232	Thank you. As I started by saying, there are a lot of Danes who use alternative treatment. And, as I also said, even several times, there is a need for them to have a place to find objective knowledge. What I am saying is that that knowledge actually exists and perhaps far more so than Mrs Liselott Blixt is aware of. There is knowledge and it is even summarized in e.g. Cochrane Reviews. This knowledge can easily be found, laid out and accessed, including as a patient. You could make it a little more accessible, I fully acknowledge that, so it is easier to read, because not everyone has a research career, and after all they also need to be able to read these things. What I'm saying is that research exists. There is not necessarily a need to make new projects about things that have already been elucidated for decades.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122313	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122314	I think that sometimes it is the difference between scientists and doctors and others who deal with everything; they know where to find things. But if Mrs Hansen or Mrs Madsen are sitting at home having cancer and want to see what is possible for them to get help outside the public system, because they will only be given chemo that they do not want, then they do not know where to go today. And they are the ones that the rapporteur lets sail because they cannot find the studies or what it is. In fact, the rapporteur himself said a little about this, namely that it should be made more accessible, but that is exactly what a knowledge centre was supposed to do. Do you not agree with that?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122353	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122355	I do not agree with the latter part. A knowledge center needs a lot more than that. Among other things, it has to be done. research, as it also lies in the proposal from Danske Patients. And that is the part that I find problematic. If we start earmarking specific research funds for specific research, I think we are breaking with an arm's length principle that we should have in the Folketing. As I also said, if you have a project, please search! There are means of independent clinical research, not enough in my optics, but they exist and there should be applied on an equal footing with everyone else. Priority should not be given to specific areas of research rather than to others.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122423	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Peder Hvelplund, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122432	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to Mrs Liselott Blixt for putting this question. I think it is really important that we have the question of how to ensure that research and knowledge sharing will be possible, but also control, the issue of access to compensation and the question of the level of education in relation to the whole question of alternative treatment. Because there is a very large proportion of the population who make use of it, and that is why I think we also have an obligation to ensure that as a citizen we know what kind of door we are entering into the health service, whether it is the authorised health service or whether it is an alternative treatment. There may also be a difference between what is of knowledge and what may be of opportunities for redress. That is why I think it is very positive that we should have this debate. As Mrs Liselott Blixt also knows, we have previously supported the establishment of ViFAB. I also think that it would be a very good idea to have a knowledge and research centre again in alternative treatment, and I also fully agree that we need to ensure that it is genuinely independent, which is why I think there are some really positive tactics. I might just as well say right away that when I do not immediately support it and do not support the proposal for adoption tabled by Mrs Liselott Blixt, a large part of the explanatory statement is the question of funding. But it is also because I also think we need to have a broader look at this. First of all, I think it is essential that we get a knowledge and research centre back, but I also think that we need a review of the whole RAB scheme, because both after ViFAB was shut down and we now have SRAB, there is no doubt that there is a lack of information and a lack of information in relation to what the scheme really stands for. That is why I think the opportunity could be for us to strengthen the RAB scheme and have a look at it again. Could we make clearer requirements, in relation to what some training requirements are required, that it is not only subject to the industry itself, but also that we ourselves go in and start to make demands, so that there will be an opportunity to have better control over, for example. Such a thing as marketing, that is to say, there is no misrepresentation in relation to claims of what effects a treatment may have, that the Patient Safety Agency is given the opportunity to ensure that proper information is provided, that there is sufficient labelling in relation to whether you are linked to the RAB, but also that we are able to clarify the possibility of having access to compensation? In my view, there are, like three layers of health care: there is the authorised health care system, there are alternative care providers, but there is also a level difference in relation to some people who actually require training and knowledge in relation to effects and side effects, and then it is clear that there is also a market that is completely unregulated. That market will continue to be there, and people must also have the right to go in and receive a treatment that they themselves believe works, but it is clear that there must be a difference in relation to whether it is something where we can say that we recognise here that it is a RAB recognised treatment, where there is access to compensation and there are demands for education and other things, so that as a citizen you also have a certain guarantee of what treatment you can receive there. That is why I think we need to see it in a larger picture, and I would really like to see that in the Enhedslisten and also together with Mrs Liselott Blixt, we could help to develop a little further, because I think there is a need to look at this area and get it better regulated. I would therefore like to read out a proposal for adoption from the Enhedslisten, and in a good research tradition I put myself on top of existing knowledge and have cut off a bit of the introduction to Mr. Stinus Lindgreen's adoption text and built a little further on it. So if anyone's wondering that it's the same guy, I'm the one who stole from mr. Stinus Lindgreen and not the other way around. But on behalf of the Enhedslisten I have to make the following: Proposal for adoption The Danish Parliament notes that a large proportion of the population is using alternative treatments. The Danish Parliament therefore agrees that objective knowledge is needed so that patients can find information about evidence of efficacy and side effects and healthcare professionals can better advise in relation to other ongoing treatment. An essential element of this will be a truly independent knowledge centre for alternative treatment, which can also support research and support evidence in relation to alternative treatment. This should be seen in the context of strengthening the RAB system, which sets out clear training requirements and requirements for control and replacement access and clearer labelling and information on the scheme. This will provide greater security for citizens so that they know what training, evidence, control and replacement requirements are behind an alternative treatment. It is vital that there is funding for such a review and for the establishment of a knowledge and research centre for alternative treatment. • V 90).
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122949	Thank you. There are a few brief comments. First, it's from Mrs Liselott Blixt.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519122954	I'm gonna have to respond to this economy thing. I think I'm gonna have to find all of you other people's suggestions so we can see what's being taken up by the economic space in, among other things. The Socialist People's Party's proposals, which we discussed earlier, or in the case of the Enhedslisten's oil billions, or whatever the hell it is you always drive forward with. I'm just tired of me constantly saying that it has to be taken from the money we give to immigrants or something else. Of course you can find the money. When you have a proposal, you fight for it, and then you will find a solution to where the money will come from. What I want to say is that it is not what can be the excuse for whether you want to work for something to help Danish citizens. So I just think it's a little too searched from Enhedslisten's side.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123040	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123041	There may be different approaches to how to deal with B proposals. I have also stood up here from the platform and rejected proposals from the Socialist People's Party, with which I agreed in principle, but which I rejected on precisely the same grounds, namely that there was no provision for funding, and that is how there may be differences in temperament in relation to how things are dealt with. As a starting point, there must be funding. It is clear that there may be amounts where it is so trifling that you do not have to do so. Now I said that part of the explanatory statement was funding, but I also said that I think we need to see it here in a whole, which is both about a knowledge and research centre, but which is also about a review of the whole RAB system, so that we ensure that it is a comprehensive package that ensures that we have better recognition and better control in relation to alternative treatment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123130	Mrs. Liselott Blixt, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123132	If you have just followed what has happened over the last few years, you know how much money was spent in ViFAB and how much you saved from putting it under the Danish Medicines Agency. After all, money is being spent on the fact that we have to get to the same level as Norway today. You brag about having something in the Danish Medicines Agency. You can start there and see how things are going. I don't demand that when you start a knowledge center, you start with everything at once. We have to see what we need, what we have, what we can get from Cochrane and what we can get from elsewhere and how we get it in. As Mr. Stinus Lindgreen says we have some knowledge, but let's start somewhere. But you just go up on the platform and say that there is no financial funding and then you don't want to be there.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123216	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123218	I am sorry if that is Mrs Liselott Blixt's view of what I am standing up here on the platform and saying. I really don't think that's what I said. I think, in fact, that I expressed a rather high degree of appreciation and that this is something we would like to continue working on, but if it is a cardinal point for the Danish People's Party that Enhedslisten should be exhibited in this way, then peace be with it. But we are actually fairly open to this and also to looking at the financing of it. I just think it is a good principle that, as a starting point, we ensure that it is financed, and especially when we come here and say that we actually think we should look at more than just the establishment of a knowledge centre.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123251	Then there is a question from Mr. Stinus Lindgreen, Radical Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123255	Thank you. We share the green profile with Enhedslisten, so it's good to see recycling here. I would like to put a question to the rapporteur. The rapporteur mentions the need to look at the whole scheme in order to guarantee patients better in terms of evidence, compensation, etc., and I agree with that. After all, this is a rather complex area and has the rapporteur taken any thought of a treatment if the research shows that it does not work, then should not be offered? Should one somehow indicate that it should not be offered to patients? What should be the consequence if research clearly shows that something does not work?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123331	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123332	It is absolutely true that this is a complex area. That is also why I think it would be sensible to have a knowledge and research centre that can help uncover this. After all, it is no secret that there is also a discussion about how to ensure evidence. How to ensure, for example. blind test in relation to alternative therapy? This may be difficult in some cases. And how to ensure some kind of evidence of whether a treatment has an effect or not? That is precisely why I think it is necessary to have a knowledge and research centre. This area is different from what we are looking at, but it does not change the fact that we also have to recognise that a large part of the population is using it and that we must also be able to provide the public with some kind of security as to what kind of door you walk in when you walk in the door of a treatment provider. I believe that it should be recognised that there is a significant difference in whether it is an acupuncturist or whether it is for a treatment in which there is no evidence of effect at all.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123436	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123437	I agree that it may be difficult to check certain studies and certain types of treatments, but nevertheless it has actually been done numerous times, including in acupuncture. It could be placebo needles that were used, or it could be different places you were stabbed to see if there are any differences, because if the theory holds there must be. I simply have to hear whether the rapporteur does not agree that we have to make the same requirement for evidence here. Whether treated with a pill, crystal or needle, we must require that those who offer it must show that there is an effect and that that effect can measure the risk of the treatment offered.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123511	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123512	It is clear that we need to have some sorts of uniform standards. But there is also treatment in health care today, where we cannot go in and say that there is evidence, but nevertheless that treatment is being used. That is why we need to look at how we can deal with this in concrete terms. There I agree that there are some challenges with alternative treatments. It just doesn't change the fact that we have to • I think that, as responsible legislators, I also recognise that a large part of the population is using it and also recognise that there is a difference between what we can make of requirements in terms of education, evidence and the possibility of replacement access. I just think we have an obligation to deliver on that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123552	Thank you. Then there is a brief comment to Mr. Martin Geertsen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123554	Thank you to the rapporteur for his speech. I am just a little curious whether the rapporteur has read the text adopted by Mrs Liselott Blixt and the rest of us. For it says in the end: the government is required to make a statement in this regard, which must include international experience, possible organisation ■ which is one of those things, Mr. Peder Hvelplund points out here that financial matters relating to a knowledge centre etc., and on this basis calls the political parties for discussions. I just need to know what it is, sir. Peder Hvelplund disagrees so much with that text bite.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123628	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123629	I think I recall that we have had this discussion in the past. It's just great if that's how we agree. Then the Left can vote in favour of the Enhedslisten's proposal for adoption or vice versa. We shall see that when we come to vote on the day. But it is clear that what lies in this is also that I believe that this is an area we should have looked at. However, it does not make any sense to call for negotiations if it is the case that some positions are blocked. That is why I think it makes sense for us to try to get a look at it. I therefore believe that we should have a broader aim than just focusing on the issue of a knowledge and research centre.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123705	There are no more brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Per Larsen, Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519123720	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to Mrs Liselott Blixt and the other authors for making this proposal. And if it were the case that Liselott Blixt had studied our draft budget a little better, then surely we could have done something together, because we have actually allocated funding in our draft budget to set up a council. I am also a little surprised that there is no broad support for the text that we have just presented, which ends with the fact that the government is required to make a statement on this subject, which must include international experience, possible organisation, economic conditions relating to a knowledge centre, etc., and, on that basis, call the political parties for discussion. Because before we do that, it will probably have been so long that a Finance Act for 2023 will have to be adopted so that funding can be put in place. But just to sum up, we in the Conservative People's Party have an intention that we should have something similar set up. In fact, we write in our Finance Bill: Alternative treatment is popular but potentially fatal. Many Danes today choose to supplement their health care with alternative treatment methods which, due to poor guidance, can have fatal consequences. After all, we have also seen in the press some terrible examples of some people who have been completely misled, people who are seriously ill with deadly diseases and therefore very vulnerable to the guidance they may then be given. It can have fatal consequences. That is why we have actually proposed that we should ensure that the penalty for quacking is increased, because there are some people who could be terribly wrong. We also see some who have recommended that people should drop their cancer treatment in the established system. Of course, we can't live with such things at all. But it is clear that there is a lot of alternative treatment. There is something that is good and there is something that has no effect whatsoever. It is clearly essential to clarify this. That is why we also think it is appropriate for us to have some more knowledge so that citizens can enter into alternative treatment enlightened. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124001	Thank you. There are no brief comments, so thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Dennis Flydtkjær, Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124013	Thank you. Thank you to Mrs Liselott Blixt for bringing alternative treatment and knowledge on this subject to discussion in this Chamber. For the Danish People's Party, it is absolutely crucial that we should be able to help and advise on alternative treatment on a scientific basis, and therefore there is an obvious need to have a place where knowledge of alternative treatment is gathered, so the rest of the health care has a place to draw on it. Dietary supplements, magnetic therapy, healing, cannabis, the list of different forms of alternative treatment is long, and many Danes use it every day. But even if at some point in their lives more than half of the population has made use of it, we in Denmark do not have a place where good information about effects and side effects can be found. Many patients experience great benefit from alternative treatment, but it can be difficult to find out what is true or what is too good to be true in relation to the effect. Unfortunately, this means that some people get hurt and, at worst, it can end up totally fatal. After all, we see today examples of patients opting out of conventional therapy in favour of an alternative that does not work or where the alternative treatment interacts badly with the medical prescribed medicine because patients have not had a knowledge-based dialogue with their doctor. We hear from a lot of people that their doctor doesn't even want to hear about these things. They are left to themselves and end up ordering oil online, which they then do not know what contains. I wouldn't do that myself. I think it is important that you discuss it with your doctor and get the scientific background for it, and if you cannot do so, it may also be a little dangerous to get started on account of the shortcomings it may cause, including quality of life and other things. After all, the purpose of a knowledge centre is precisely to support the dialogue on alternative treatment between doctors and patients, because health professionals too lack a place where they can find evidence-based knowledge and research in this area. Many doctors feel quite naturally insecure when it comes to alternative treatment, where there are mostly slender or deficient evidence-based knowledge about effects and side effects, and this makes it difficult for the doctor to talk to patients and guide them on options. And this is precisely where we need to have a knowledge centre on the field, because it can then contribute to that. The aim of the Centre shall not be to promote or impede the use of alternative treatment, but to ensure access to research-based information. I can therefore also say that we support the establishment of a knowledge centre and that the Danish People's Party supports the proposal for adoption which Mrs Liselott Blixt has read out earlier.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124253	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. I do not see any more rapporteurs wanting to come up and spend their time on the platform. Then I can give the floor to the Minister for Health, but the Minister for Health has nothing more to say. Mrs Liselott Blixt has. I call Mrs Liselott Blixt. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124320	Thank you very much. I always think it's nice to just come up and say thank you for the debate. It's shown how different we are. If one wants a place where one can seek knowledge of alternative treatment, one should certainly not vote for the Radical or Liberal Alliance. They don't want that. Social democracy will not do anything either. They weren't on the other one. So it just shows the difference that's on us. This is something we want to prioritise, and it was something we prioritized together with the previous government, together with the Left and the Conservatives. Thank you for the debate.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124353	Thank you. No one else has asked for the floor. Then the debate is complete. The vote on the proposals for adoption submitted will take place only on Thursday, 2 June 2022.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124428	The debate is open. Mr President, first of all I should like to speak on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Troels Ravn, draftsman of the Social Democratic Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124456	It has obviously not been signed up well enough, because the rapporteur is called Malte Larsen, but it is true that I have taken over the task of Troels Ravn, who unfortunately could not be present in the Chamber. Thank you for the floor. Following the government's initiative • Denmark more The government, DF, SF, Radicals and Christian Democrats can enter into an agreement on a new reform package for the Danish economy. The bill here translates parts of that agreement. In practical terms, these are three things. First, there is a reduction in the electricity tax. A significant reduction of the general electricity tax is proposed by 14 øre per year. kilowatt-hour rising to 17 cents until 2030. It must provide incentives to make more green choices and make us more electrified our society. In addition, there is the abolition of the green check, where it is proposed to abolish the green check for non-pensioners from the income year 2023 and halve the green check for the income year 2022 corresponding to an abolition per year. 1 July 2022. However, the supplementary green check for children is maintained and increased to 240 DKK. per a child from 2023 for both pensioners and non-pensioners. We also have an increased allowance for employment. The last part of the agreement, which the draft law implements, aims to strengthen the incentive to go to work. It is therefore proposed to increase the maximum employment allowance by DKK 700. in 2023 and 2024 and with an additional DKK 1,200. From 2025. It is important for it to continue and pay better off to go to work, but also to strengthen the working community. With those words, I must inform you that the Social Democratic Party supports the bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124641	Thank you. I'm sorry for the confusion of names. That's what happens when you just read out your papers. Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Rune Lund, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124651	Thank you. This bill, after all, with the abolition of the green cheque for people who are not pensioners, will mean that a lot of money will be taken from low-income people in our country. It is due to enter into force on 1 June of this year. I think that is in principle wrong. But is it not also a little crazy or grotesque in a situation where we are currently negotiating compensation for households because of rising energy prices, that is to say we are discussing how to give with one hand, among other things. to pensioners with low incomes, and with this bill does the government come along with SF, Radical and Danish People's Party with a proposal to take money from other groups who very much need help?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124740	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124741	I and we have the greatest understanding of the low-income groups that are currently coming into contact with the very high energy prices and, moreover, with the general price increases that are in society. An agreement has been drawn up here with entry into force and with effect in the future, a very good and sensible agreement with the things that then have to do with it. I think it makes very good sense to implement the agreement, but at the same time to look at whether, in the negotiations that the rapporteur is talking about, there is a need for temporary compensation targeted at the individual groups that have also been turned around.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124818	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124831	That sounds good. For at least we will have to postpone the very large economic hammer that hits people with low incomes by abolishing the green cheque from 1 July, that is to say in a few minutes. And I would also like the rapporteur to be able to comment again on the fact that the Social Democrats are reporting, that they want to give some money to pensioners who have the lowest incomes, but that they do not have an answer to what they are going to give to other people on transfer income, who are also suffering in the current situation, while going out and actually taking money from some of those who have the least in our society. It's grotesque, isn't it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124912	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124914	This is certainly a situation that can be incredibly sensitive to those families where this is at stake. But that is also why I say that I think it is quite reasonable to enter into the agreements and stand by the agreements that have been made. However, the proposal we have made is that it should be negotiated in concrete terms in relation to families with low incomes and with very high heating bills, where it has been agreed how families, such as the United Kingdom, are going to have to negotiate. In the case of natural gas, compensation can be made if they do not have a high family income.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124949	Thank you. There are no more brief comments. We thank the rapporteur and welcome the next rapporteur, Mr Seligman. Kenneth Mikkelsen from the Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519124959	Thank you for that, President. In the Left, we take the elements of the draft law down positively here as a starting point. It is good that the electricity tax is further reduced in view of the significant additional costs currently incurred by the high energy prices for both companies and households. It is also positive that the limit on the maximum employment allowance should be increased as it can contribute to an increase in the supply of labour. Having said that, we must also note that the draft law here is based on a broader reform agreement concluded by parties where the Left and, incidentally, the other blue parties are not included. And in the Left we are critical of parts of the reform agreement, among others. the part that gives • let me call it gifts to the trade union movement. We also think it is a problem that this reform package provides higher daily allowances during a period when we need labour. However, as I said at the outset, we are in favour of exactly the elements contained in the draft law here. However, there is a source of concern, one might say, and the source is, of course, that it may be a little unclear in relation to the draft law to see how cross-financing is between the entities involved in the project of the overall reform package. So we in the Left would like to clarify further what it is like to have the funding totally linked to the further committee before we finally take a position on the draft law here. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125147	Thank you. There are no brief comments. Thank you to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur is Mr Seligman. Jan Bjergskov Larsen from the Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125201	Thank you, sir. President. For the sake of good order, I would like to start by pointing out that tax policy is not part of my rapporteur's work, but is here on behalf of Mr Seligman. Carl Valentin, who unfortunately could not be here today. After all, the proposal here is to implement the agreements in which the SF is involved, and above all we support the idea of further reducing the electricity tax. And although a lot of good things have happened in the energy sector, it is entirely in line with SF's policy that Denmark should be free of fossil fuels as soon as possible. And with this proposal, we are putting an additional turbo on the green switch. A further reduction in the electricity tax would, in fact, lead to a starting point where it would be more attractive to move away from fossil fuels and, on the other hand, to energy sources based on renewable energy sources as much as possible. It is of course a key point here that green energy sources become the most attractive and competitive alternative for the Danes. Further action is needed now, and we need to continue to lead the way in Denmark. When it comes to the second part of the proposal, which aims to cancel the green check for non-pensioners, yes, the approach by the SF has been somewhat more reserved. As you know, the green cheque was intended to meet some of the lowest earning income groups in relation to the increasing costs of the green conversion. Nevertheless, when we have agreed to the green cheque being cancelled for non-pensioners, this is because the reduction in the electricity tax will benefit lower income groups. However, we believe, like Enhedslisten, that it could have been appropriate to postpone the abolition of the green check, bearing in mind the high energy prices that the Danes are experiencing right now. And with regard to the third leg of the proposal, which aims to increase the maximum employment allowance, we would have liked to see an improvement that was more targeted at those Danes who have a low labour income. It did not seem to be possible, and then it has to be said that such are politics and negotiations sometimes. And with those words, I can tell you that the SF supports the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125407	Thank you. There is one brief comment. Sir. Rune Lund, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125412	Denmark can do more than one is an agreement which generally destroys the daily allowance for newly trained and newly trained people and which is generally socially biased and increases inequality, and this bill in itself is also socially biased and increases inequality, and this is largely due to the abolition of the green cheque, which is otherwise a key tool in the green transition, because when we raise taxes and it is necessary to have a change in behaviour, we must also ensure that there is social compensation. So my question is quite basically: is it not fundamentally very wrong to abolish the green cheque for the groups that it is about here? I would also like to mention the grotesque thing about the fact that we are currently negotiating compensation for households with the one hand where we, among other things, are dealing. must give money to pensioners, while this bill already takes money from some of the people who have the very least in our society from 1 July.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125503	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125504	As I said in my speech, exactly the green check is not a proposal that has grown in SF's backyard. We would like to see that part of it actually postponed. But it is also the case with a large number of agreements that there is something that will only be compensated for later. We can't throw everything up in the air at once. So the compensation that's being demanded, I'm sure it'll be somewhere else.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125536	The questioner.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125537	This is to be hoped now that the SF has provided the crucial mandates for the abolition of the green cheque for people who are not pensioners. However, the question is also why the SF has provided the crucial mandates for the abolition of the green cheque for a large number of low-income people, as is the case here in the draft law. What does the SF intend to do in relation to the negotiations that are currently under way, when the government has only played out to compensate pensioners, while the abolition of the green cheque here will hit many others than only pensioners?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125616	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125616-2	To this my answer as a non-rapporteur in this area is that it must be taken subsequently in committee work with the SF's tax rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125626	There are no more brief comments. We thank the rapporteur. I do not see any rapporteur for the Radical Left, so the next rapporteur is Mr. Rune Lund, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519125645	Thank you. We are here today discussing three elements of the agreement Denmark can more I·, which is an inequality-building reform, which is a social reform that is a reform that destroys the daily allowances for newly educated and newly trained people; a reform agreement concluded by the parties Social Democracy, the SF, Radical and the Danish People's Party and joined by the Christian Democrats. It is a very crooked agreement, it is an agreement that goes against the understanding paper that we agreed in June 2019, and it is an agreement that basically questions whether the initiatives taken since the June 2019 elections, in isolation, have contributed to what is in the understanding paper a new government has to live up to: reducing inequality and reducing child poverty. It is an agreement which underlines that, if we are to achieve what is stated in the understanding paper, we need to deliver on the part of the government, and in this respect it is quite appropriate that we should get an agreement in the ongoing performance negotiations on services, on combating child poverty, on securing some of the poorest people in our country who are on transfer income, including on cash benefits, otherwise what is stated in the understanding paper will not be delivered, otherwise it will not be delivered on the basis on which the government came on and which is crucial for the government also to be able to sit on the mandate of the Unity List. Specifically, the green cheque, which is a way of supporting people with low incomes and, to a certain extent, also ordinary incomes, is being abolished in order to compensate for rising taxes. Rising taxes are something we can and must support, because rising taxes, for example. Green taxes mean that we will have a change in behaviour so that less is used by what pollutes and harms the climate, but at the same time there are some people who have the very least in our country that we can compensate socially so that they do not end up in poverty or further poverty, as we introduce the necessary taxes to combat, for example. climate change and pollution. It is therefore also a very, very wrong policy, and I am particularly disappointed by the SF and the Radicals, who have provided the crucial mandates for the socially biased and inequality-building agreement. Denmark can more I.U., including the abolition of the green cheque, as described in this bill, for non-pensioners. That's why Enhedslisten is definitely not going to back this bill. There are questions about the electricity tax that we can in a way take a positive view of, but where we would rather not reduce the electricity tax, because a lower electricity tax means everything else equal, that more energy is being used. We would have preferred to have kept the electricity tax at the level at which it was, but at the same time had turned up the green cheque, because then we would have had the behavioural change in that we would not use more electricity because the electricity would be cheaper, while we would have received the social compensation. But as the bill is here and with the elements in it, the Enhedslisten cannot in any way support it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130028	There are no brief comments, so I would like to thank the rapporteur. I see no rapporteur for the Conservative People's Party, so the next rapporteur is Mr Conservatives. Dennis Flydtkjær, Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130040	When there are no more rapporteurs, it typically goes faster and there are fewer short remarks. This is the execution of an agreement between the Danish People's Party, the government, the SF, the Radicals and the Christian Democrats, so it almost goes without saying that we support the bill. Not only do we do that because it is part of the agreement, but we actually think it is a legislative proposal with a very good content. There are, as has been mentioned, three elements in it. One is a reduction of the electricity tax by 17 cents towards 2030. I think that is very good for Denmark. In other words, we want people to drive more electric cars or to have heat pumps set up. And if we could only see yesterday that there is a plan for a massive expansion of renewable energy, that is to say electricity, which is to replace gas and other things, then it makes sense that we should then also reduce the electricity tax. Because when we arrive towards 2030, all power should be green, and therefore it is difficult to argue why there should be a high behavior-regulating tax on it. So in the Danish People's Party we see the lowering of the electricity tax as part of the green transition and think it is really positive. Then there is another element in the bill, and that is an increase in the employment allowance, initially with DKK 700. rising to DKK 1,200. From 2025 onwards. It is not something that provides a huge tax relief for people who are at work, but we do think it is positive that there should be an increase in the employment allowance so that work pays better. So we think it is quite good that we should also consider making more of other agreements forward-looking. Part of the funding does not cover the whole funding, but part of it is the abolition of the green cheque for non-pensioners. In fact, I think you can defend it against the Enhedslisten. I understand that there may well be some problems if you look at it in isolation, but if you look at the overall agreement that is made, not just this bill, virtually all groups go in plus. I think it's something about lonely resident su recipients losing 200 kroner. Every year, and then there's another group that loses a little bit of money on it, but otherwise everybody actually goes in plus with this deal, and I think that's really positive. But you also have to bear it in mind, when you look at the green check, that, as Enhedslisten said, it was indeed introduced to compensate for a number of rising taxes, but all the taxes for which it was intended to compensate have been removed. And since you then remove the green check for a large part of the Danes, while at the same time relaxing the electricity tax, I think you can actually stand up for it. So the Danish People's Party can support this bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130307	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to Mr Seligman. Rune Lund, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130311	It is true, as the rapporteur says, that many people benefit from this if the methods of calculation used by the Ministry of Taxation are used. But we have cash benefits recipients who will lose hundreds of dollars. These are people who do not have much in advance and who already live on a stone. At the same time, we are also dealing with a reform, Denmark can do more, also in relation to the change in the employment allowance that lies here, which is a tax relief for the benefit of the better off. The Danish People's Party sometimes tries to present itself as a party that takes care of some of those who have the least, or who have the hardest, in our society. Is that really what you've done with this deal, and is that really what's happening with this bill?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130404	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130405	Thank you for the question. I think that there may also be a different view of how to see society. In other words, if you are sitting as cash benefits recipients, I do not always believe that it is the best solution for them to get to work, for example, that we give them a higher benefit or more green cheque. Then it might be that it was an incentive to get to work, among other things. by a higher allowance for employment. It may also be through other initiatives. I just think that you look at it ideologically differently. After all, we have been involved in introducing the employment allowance many years ago. It has been raised several times. Sometimes with us, sometimes by others. But that is because you want an incentive for working to pay off. This is a very specific incentive to be lifted by this agreement and this bill. We in the Danish People's Party really think so. This does not mean that other groups cannot be taken care of in other areas; if you are socially vulnerable, if you are a pensioner, an early retirement or something else. However, the fact that we are giving a good incentive to take a job or that we are lowering the electricity tax, which is also part of what is, moreover, also turning in a positive way in relation to the social balance and which ensures a green transition, etc., is a good thing. So I actually think there are a lot of good elements in this bill.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130507	Sir. Rune Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130508	But sir... Dennis Flydtkjær confirm that this agreement takes money from some of those who have the very least in our society, that it gives money to some of those who have the most in our society, including those with higher salaries, and that it is therefore socially biased and increases inequality, and that this also applies to the bill that we are discussing today?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130530	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130531	Well, I actually mentioned it a little bit in my speech. As I remember, there are two groups or something that gets less out of this deal. That's pretty much true. Then you can put your finger on it. One of them, I don't remember the other... I think it's a lone su-beneficiary who loses 200 kroner. a year. One might think that it is quite awful and that the world is collapsing and that it is a welfare sactress. I do not think it is so violent when, at the same time, it has made it more attractive to work, i.e. by raising this limit on when you are set off in su, so there is actually something that could also be drawn in the other direction, so that you might be able to make more money. So I really think that the overall balance of the agreement we have made has been quite fine. But yes, there are two groups that I remember getting less out of it, and all other groups get more out of it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130614	Thank you, sir. Dennis Flydtkjær and thus thanks to the Danish People's Party. I do not see any more of the party rapporteurs present, so I can give the floor to the tax minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519130634	Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank you for receiving the bill. It is true that, with the agreement on a new reform package for the Danish economy, we took another step towards adapting the labour market of the future and, above all, towards the green transition. After all, today we are dealing with a legislative proposal which implements parts of that agreement. First of all, with the legislative proposal, we are reducing the electricity tax. The government and the parties agreed with the agreement on a reform package for the Danish economy that massive investment should be made in, among other things. a green switch. At the same time, we must remember to give the Danes the right incentive to choose the green solution over the black one, and with the reduction of the electricity tax we make the green choice easier for the Danes. This will make it more attractive to invest in an electric car, just as more will supplement the heating with a heat pump it is important in this time. Increased electrification is basically an important prerequisite for the transition to green energy, which is why it is also positive for our climate objective that we have agreed to lower the tax on ordinary electricity consumption. In order to finance the reduction of the electricity tax, the parties to the agreement agree to abolish the green cheque for non-pensioners from the marketing year 2023. For the marketing year 2022, the cheque shall be halved corresponding to the abolition on 1 July. The green cheque for pensioners will be maintained unchanged. The green cheque was introduced in 2010 as a tax-free and income-dependent reduction in the calculated tax. The background to the green cheque was a desire to compensate people with relatively low incomes for a number of tax increases that occurred during the 2009 reform. That is why I also think it makes sense that the abolition of the green cheque for non-pensioners is used to finance the reduction in the electricity tax. Then it is right and I am not blind to the fact that the timing of the abolition in view of the situation in Ukraine and rising inflation and prices and the consideration of possible compensation as a result could give rise to the question that Mr. Rune Lund, too. However, what we are now proposing with the draft law is in line with the agreement reached in January 2022 and, as I said, is part of a new reform package for the Danish economy. And we must also bear in mind that, in accordance with the agreement, we are also proposing to increase the additional green cheque for people with children. In addition, the draft law provides for an increase in the maximum employment allowance so that work can pay better. The vast majority of people in Denmark are in the labour market, many young people have leisure jobs after school and jobs during their studies, and many seniors also take an extra job. Work means support and economic independence, but also much more than that. Being in a workplace brings fellowship, self-esteem and dignity. It is important to invest in the labour market of the future and to make it attractive to work, which is why I also welcome the fact that the part of the legislative proposal we are discussing today helps to strengthen the incentive to go to work and is part of a comprehensive reform package that strengthens our labour market and also strengthens the professional organisation, the green transition, our education and much more. To conclude, I would like to thank you for the debate that has been going on today, although I think that we could have been a few more in the Chamber and I am of course happy to answer questions. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131012	Thank you, Minister. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to the Minister, and that is from Mr Seligman. Rune Lund, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131018	We are currently negotiating compensation for households because of the aftermath of the corona and Putin attack war in Ukraine, and that is sensible. The social democracy has, among other things, a role to play in the process of European integration. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, and to thank him for the excellent work he has done on this subject. Doesn't it seem grotesque to want to give with one hand to some groups and at the same time want to take with the other hand?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131117	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131120	Yes, and the timing of what I also mentioned in my introduction here, I am certainly not blind to it, but I have to say that if you look at the legislative proposal now before you, the green cheque helps to finance, as I said, a reduction in the electricity tax, an increase in the employment allowance. That is to say, there are many groups in this equation that are in a plus, and then it is a challenge that the lowest incomes in this country are feeling the price increases the hardest, and that is why I very much hope that all the good intentions that are, to make compensation, can come about. Now we have made heat checks together, we have made sure that there is more money in the municipalities to help those who have nowhere else to go, and we are working to ensure that we also have a compensation package in which we help those who have the least and who have the most difficulty in increasing their income.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131209	Sir. Rune Lund.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131210	But if the timing is not so good, should we not change the timing and cancel the economic hammer, which will hit many people on low incomes on 1 July because of the abolition of the green cheque for non-pensioners that this bill entails? Isn't that what we have to do? I would like to see it permanently abolished. One could at least start by changing the timing and then turn it into a temporary abolition.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131240	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131241	Yes, but it is the case that if we reduce the electricity tax, as we are doing here, and we increase the tax on employment, then we are also going to set aside some funding. And then, of course, I can understand the view of doing everything that is good and then also removing funding, and that is the challenge of that thinking. That's why I understand it's a little bit to look in different directions and boxes. I admit that, and that is why we are very concerned about how we support those who have the least in this society.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131314	Thank you to the Secretary of State for Taxation. There are no further brief comments to the Minister of Taxation in this instance. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the bill be referred to the Committee on Taxation and, if no one objects, I consider it adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131328	The debate is open. The first to speak is the Minister for Education and Research. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131353	Thank you for the floor. The authors of the motion for a resolution want to require the government to amend the Su Act so that students who are islanders and under 18 years of age and study on the mainland are given the right to receive su as a resident. The proposal is justified by the fact that islanders under the age of 18 may have challenges with regard to transport to and from their youth education, where in some cases it is not possible to get to and from the place of education on the same day. Equal access to education, regardless of who you are and where you live, is a pillar of the Danish education system. It is an important social democratic value, but it does not change the fact that the proposal in its content falls within the scope of the compromise, of which the party of the proposers is also a part. That is why it is a little strange and unusual for us to deal with a proposal in this Chamber which actually belongs in that circle according to the usual way of working. After all, in good parliamentary practice, conciliation is taken up in a conciliation circle if a conciliation party wants to put an issue in conciliation on the political agenda. The government respects all the settlements reached, and for this reason alone we cannot support the proposal. But the proposal has now been put forward, and we have here so many rapporteurs who are now present to have a political debate on it, so in all peace, a few comments on it. As I said, the government agrees with the premise of the proposal that there must be good educational opportunities throughout the country. We are actively working on this, and we are doing so together with the proposers' party. The Danish education system offers all young people a high quality education, and with the agreement on more and better educational opportunities throughout Denmark we have created the basis for more young people to be able to train in the future close to where they live and have grown up. The government therefore supports the basic intention of the proposal, namely that it is not the address that determines whether a young person can take an education. But I do not think that su is the right instrument for ensuring equal access to education for young islanders under 18 years of age. First of all, it is a basic premise of the su system that you have to be 18 years of age in order to be able to have su, and this is due to the fact that young people under 18 years of age are covered by the parents' allowance simply enter only when you are 18. Secondly, other support opportunities for young islanders under the age of 18 are already available in the education system. Among other things, you can... In addition, there is also a need to ensure that young people who move out of islands to take up continental youth training receive financial support for, among other things: diet and rent. Finally, there are several places in the country youth education which offer school homes or have boarding departments. In my own part of the country there is the concrete example that if you are a student or apprentice under 18 years of age and in a basic course of vocational training in the EUC South and have more than five quarters of transport time from home to school, there is simply the possibility of living free of charge in school homes in Sønderborg, Haderslev or Tønder. This is not the case everywhere, but there are some general support opportunities for those who need extra transport support, and there are also special offers such as the one I have just mentioned here. So I really believe that the support opportunities for the target group to which the proposal is directed already exist, and I do not immediately see that on this basis we are going to have to make fundamental changes to the premises of our Su system. To sum up, the government cannot support the resolution. We cannot do that because the issues covered by the su-conciliation must be dealt with in and by the su-conciliation circle. It is important to respect the settlement reached. This is also usually the way the Danish People's Party works. And we cannot support the proposal because there are already better support opportunities outside the Su system for the target group of the proposal. The very intention of ensuring that education is available and available throughout the country, as I have said, we are in complete agreement with the proposers of this House. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131815	Thank you, Minister. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to the Minister from Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker, the Danish People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131821	Thank you very much. In the Danish People's Party, of course, we respect the settlements we have reached, and that is why I must also be the first to deplore the wording in the title, which should not have been written "su" but "a service equivalent to su" so that we do not go in and tamper with the system. Because it is about helping the very few people who are now in Denmark who live on an island and cannot get to and from school every day, and where it is unfortunately the case today that it is up to the parents' purse whether young people can get an education or not. Is that the way we should go? Because I hear the minister say that it is being taken care of in some places and then the hell can take the last. But in the Danish People's Party we would really like to seize those people who have no other option. So what will the Minister do about it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131912	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519131913	What I can answer, and for which I am responsible, is the Su system, and that is also what the proposal is about, and that is why I have been sent down here on behalf of the government because a proposal has been put forward concerning su. I have then tried to make some arguments as to why I do not think it is the right tool. Mrs Hjermind Dencker also says that it is probably one of the other ways to go. And you hear me absolutely not saying that this is not a relevant discussion. I have tried to explain some of the other options that exist in order to support young people in relation to the transport needs they have when, for example, they have. live on an island and can have a long way to school when you have special transportation needs. But if you want to have a real political discussion with concrete proposals for other services or to do something more within what already exists or whatever it may be, then it is simply not me as minister who is responsible for it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132016	Mrs. Mette Hjermind Dencker.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132018	I simply have to say that, for some, there are no other options for people for whom there are no other options. What the Minister has said is not adequate, given whether there is any possibility that we in the State will ensure that it is never the case that the money purse of the parents will decide whether or not we are going to receive an education. No, there's no way. Some municipalities are good to their citizens and others are not; in some there are subsidies for transport, but what does the fact that there are subsidies for transport when you cannot take care of your education? When you can't get to and from the same day, it doesn't matter if they get it for free. That's not the problem. So I just want to hear the Minister: is the Minister in favour of us having these American conditions where it is up to the parents' purse whether the child can get an education, or is the Minister in favour of us getting this problem solved and grabbing the children we are talking about? Because it's less than 100 people. Is the Minister willing to take a look at this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132122	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132123	What I explained in my speech before is the offer that already exists of support for young islanders under 18 years of age with a discount on public transport, just like young people who move away from an island, because otherwise it is simply too difficult to take a youth education on the mainland, can receive financial support for, among other things. diet and rent. If you want other specific offers, that is something you have to take up with the relevant ministers or the municipalities that may be responsible here. I do not have the opportunity in the area in which I am responsible when it comes to su, in a meaningful way, to spread it. And I also understand that the Danish People's Party agrees not with the way we should go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132214	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief remarks to the Minister, and so the number of rapporteurs can begin their rapporteur's speeches. The first rapporteur comes from the Social Democratic Party, and that is Mrs Tanja Larsson.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132228	For social democracy, rural and island development is an important area, and it is very much in my hands and for the party; it is a large part of our DNA. It is important for us with a Denmark in balance where we keep the small communities alive and where it is not geography that determines whether you get an education, whether you settle or whether you have a job to stand up to. That is why, since we took over the keys to the Prime Minister's Office, we have also fought for a number of important steps, all of which serve the purpose of strengthening rural areas and small island communities. We have among other things. As part of the municipal system of subsidies and compensation, a new grant was adopted for the vulnerable peripheral and island municipalities. At the moment, we are currently discussing a legislative proposal to improve loan opportunities when citizens want to settle in rural areas, because it is important that in the future there is also life in rural areas. We have also reached a political agreement on more life in rural urban centres. With the agreement, we ensure, among other things. better opportunities for citizen-run grocery stores in rural areas, reducing the number of debilitated houses and better broadband throughout the country. With the motion for a resolution here, the proposers of the DF then want to discuss amendments to the Su Act so that young islanders under 18 years of age will have access to su as a resident. First of all, I agree that the distance from youth education should not be a decisive factor in whether young people receive education or determine what youth education young people receive. This also applies, of course, to young people living in rural areas or out on the small islands. With the programme • Closer to II • we therefore also proposed to ensure more youth education courses throughout Denmark, just as we have also agreed in the field of higher education to ensure more and better educational opportunities throughout Denmark. So it is both my and the Social Democrats' concern that we create the best framework for children and young people throughout Denmark and that they have access to education. Because we know that easy access to education can be crucial for young people to receive youth education. Equal access to education, no matter where you come from, is a matter of social democracy. However, as the Minister has already mentioned, the Social Democratic Party cannot support the proposal here. First of all, we cannot do so because the content of the proposal is covered by the un-conciliation, and I agree with the Minister that conciliation should be discussed in a conciliation circle. I therefore reject the proposal and call on the proposers to take it into account. If I am to add a few words to the content itself, as I said earlier, I agree with the intentions contained in the proposal in terms of ensuring equal access to education. Then the question is whether su is the right tool to use in this case. There are already a number of possibilities, as the Minister has also mentioned, and offers to young people under the age of 18 who live on the islands. Unfortunately, in view of this and respect for conciliation, we cannot support the resolution here. And I welcome from the Enhedslisten and SF, who support the fact that we will find a report together in committee. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132549	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur and it is for Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker, the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132553	As I also said to the Minister, I have great respect for the fact that we do not want to change anything in relation to our agreement on sugar. This is just about a performance equivalent to su. It is quite possible that you can focus on the fact that there are some places where action has been taken to resolve this. But what my focus is on is that we haven't reached everyone. We haven't reached everyone with this. There are some islands where it simply depends on the parents' purse whether you can get an education. So I would just like to ask the rapporteur: is the rapporteur interested in catching these people and finding a solution, or does the rapporteur feel like the minister, in other words that they have to deal with it themselves?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132639	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132640	Thank you. That is certainly not what I heard the Minister say. Now I know the Minister, and I know that this is far from the position that the Minister usually takes when I discuss matters with him, and that is not my position either. We are putting forward a proposal which starts with the question of sugar, but then we want to take it into something else, and the rapporteur must respect the fact that I am dealing with what has been put forward, that is to say with the proposal that has been put forward here. This, of course, makes it a little difficult to get into concrete terms about what you want, but I think we should sit down in committee and try to find out what solutions are available around us. Perhaps there are some solutions that neither you nor I are sorry, I believe that neither the rapporteur nor I nor those who live on the islands actually know about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132725	Thank you for making the correction for yourself. It is correct that this is the way it is called. Here you go to Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker for another brief remark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132733	Thank you. There are different ways of solving it around, and I know of someone about that, because I am probably the politician who travels most to the Danish islands. So I know a lot of different solutions that we can copy to other places. But it's just important that we take responsibility for it in here from Christiansborg, because as it looks now, it's about living in the right municipality for you to get the right help. That is what we must avoid, and that is what I want to know whether the rapporteur is in favour, so that we take care of the last people who are missing and who simply do not have other options. In relation to that, we can forget everything the Minister says, because that is not the world in which they live. They don't have those options.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132820	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132821	Thank you. I have to answer as I did before. In other words, of course we are in favour of young people being educated and being as good as possible. But that is not where this debate belongs. It doesn't belong under Su. These students are under 18 years of age, and they're for 18+-year-olds.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132842	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no further brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Left, and that is Mr Seligman. Hans Andersen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519132853	Thank you for that, and thank you to the Danish People's Party for raising this debate, which we in the Left see as a discussion on how we can ensure that young people under the age of 18 who live on an island are given the opportunity and have the opportunity to take a youth education course. We do not know the extent of the problem, and we can also see that what we read in the motion for a resolution costs in the region of 5 million. Mr President, I should like to make a few comments on this report. However, we think that we should clarify the issue, what the challenge is quite specifically, and we would very much like to work on that in committee, so that we can know what it is that is needed to make it attractive for young people both to stay here and also to take an education. There are currently subsidies for transport, but is it the subsidy that is too small? We want to discuss this, and what should we do about it? So we think that we should discuss it here in committee, and that could certainly result in a report in which we commit each other to uncovering this so that we can find the challenge. We shall then also have to have those parties involved in the work, in respect of the conciliation which exists. So this is our approach to this resolution. We welcome this discussion and we look forward to a report in committee. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519133044	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Left. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. And then I have noticed that the Socialist rapporteur from a few of the parties has welcomed it. In addition, there are a number of parties that are not present, but the Conservative rapporteur, Mr. Niels Flemming Hansen is here. Welcome. The word is the rapporteur's.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519133101	Thank you very much for that and thank you very much to Mrs Hjermind Dencker for putting forward this proposal and thank you very much for it. As a starting point, we really think there is a lot of sense in the proposal that is coming, but on the other hand we have also tried to get an overview of what is of benefits in the various places, that is, what is available. If, for example, you're gonna have to... live at Anholt and want to go to Grenaa and read, you can stay at some kind of college, but if you want to read somewhere else, it suddenly becomes difficult, and what do you have of benefits, what do you have of money? So we are probably thinking of sending a shepherd's letter from the committee in some way to the municipalities to hear what is happening here, what we have of opportunities in different places, and then we hope to land a positive report on it. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519133152	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. And since all the rapporteurs who wanted to speak on this matter have now taken the floor, I can give the floor to the rapporteur for the authors of the motion, and that is precisely Mrs Mette Hjermind Dencker from the Danish People's Party. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519133213	Thank you. As the author of the proposal, I should like to begin by regretting the fact that the proposal contains the right to be resident for students under 18 years of age who should have been entitled to a benefit similar to that of non-residents under 18 years of age, since they are not su when they are under 18 years of age. The proposal, on the other hand, has been made on the basis of a lot of wonderful visits I have had on the islands for the last 11 years, I have been a member of parliament, and over all the years I have had the pleasure of being the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party for rural areas and islands. On the islands I have often been brought to the problem that the islands generally have with the school system, not only when you are finished with the 9th grade, but also the problem that the small schools on the islands typically go to the 6th grade or something, so it is therefore very small children that you have to send to boarding school when they are finished with the 6th grade, so that is another problem they also have. When they are finally finished with the 9th grade, school days typically get a little longer when you go to high school or vocational training or commercial school or hf, or whatever it may be, and there they say, many of the ears, with the problem that you simply cannot get to and from the island on the same day and look after your school properly. Some municipalities, as both the Minister and the Conservatives have said, are friendly and support the islands, and they have different ways of supporting their islanders. There are some who support their islanders by simply setting up a continental collective for the islanders or the possibility of a dorm room in a certain place. Then there are also those who give full support, give some amount for board and lodging, and then there are others who say that this school, for example. must be a dietary gymnasium that you can walk on. There are a little different ways of solving it. But what is the essence of it is that it is not resolved everywhere. After all, we want the islands to be inhabited throughout the year by not only older people but also families with children, so it is also important that we make the islands accessible to families with children throughout the year. That is why it is also important for us to ensure that the children are well cared for throughout, and this applies to both the care system, the school and the education system. This is incredibly important, and it is something we must take care of here. We cannot just add it to the municipalities, because not all municipalities do the job. I have to say that when I have been on the islands, I dare to say without insulting anyone that the islanders are not therefore more well-ventilated financially than the rest of us. I think I can go so far as to say that I may be experiencing the opposite in many places, so it is not high-income families who bear the cost of paying for an apartment and food and everything when they send their child away at the age of 15-16. So it's a big problem for the people it affects. So when we here in Denmark are hammering proud of our education system and we have every reason to be proud of our education system, where everyone, rich and poor, can get an education... we just have to remember that this is not the way it is. We just have to remember that there are places in Denmark where it is the parents' purse that decides whether children can get an education. Fortunately, it is few places, but it exists. These are not all islands, because there are plenty of islands that have easy access with frequent flights to the mainland. It could, for example, be done. be Fanoe, who has 12 minutes into Esbjerg, where high school can easily be taken care of. The Limfjord Islands also have short transport time. These are not all islands at all, but these are islands in which parents alone have to bear the cost, and I do not think we can be familiar with that. The good news, on the other hand, is about the demography of the islands, if you can say that this is good news, since unfortunately it is the case on the islands that there are not so many families with children. So it is actually only going to be quite, very few people, and therefore it can be solved by allocating a pool of 5 million. kr., which I don't think comes close to being fully used. So, even if we help only a few people with this proposal, it means the world to the people we help, and hopefully we will also help to make the way to being islanders even shorter when we take them off those burdens. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519133744	Thank you to the rapporteur for the authors. There is no wish for short remarks. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Rural Development and the Islands. Now I am speaking very slowly, and I shall begin by stating that if no one objects to it, I consider it adopted. It's agreed. That is the point. 32, and the reason why I am speaking very slowly now is that we are going to have to get on with paragraph No in a moment. 33, and the launch of the paragraph calls for the Minister to be present in the Chamber, and I look very carefully at the Socialist rapporteur, who signals that he is on his way, and the road to the Parliamentary Chamber may be long, because there are many stairs. What else can I talk about? I know the number of steps. It wasn't the minister who came in there. I'm just gonna wait one more minute. That is what is called the last minute, no, it is well past the last minute. Nevertheless, we are now in the process of being ready for the first reading of motion for a resolution No. B 108.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519133904	The debate is open. The first to be given the floor with a reasonably high pulse is probably the Minister for Employment. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519133935	Thank you very much. I regret to the President that the second point suddenly went very fast. But we hurried, and we succeeded. However, thank you for the proposal and also for the opportunity to discuss how we can improve the active employment effort, which is, of course, a crucial part of our labour market model. During the corona epidemic, job centres and a-boxes made some important experiences with digital conversations with the unemployed. For the unemployed, the possibility of digital conversations can provide greater flexibility in the effort and can also be adapted to the needs of the citizen. For the job centre and the cashier, digital conversations, in addition to being a good tool in the effort, can also contribute to a more effective employment effort. This is also the reason why we have jointly introduced that unemployed per year. 1 January 2022 has the possibility of telephone or video conversations when they have been available for 6 months. When we drew the limit at 6 months, it was because among other things. There was uncertainty as to whether digital interviews for job-ready unemployed have the same effect on employment as is assumed on the basis of research for physical interviews during the first 6 months. Since then, the official work has updated the calculation principles for digital conversations, and this has been possible on the basis of the results of a controlled trial of conversations conducted in Sweden. The updated calculation principles mean that, in future, digital conversations will have a positive effect on employment. However, the effect is less than for physical conversations. In their comments, the proposers write that they expect there to be even greater savings by allowing digital conversations from day one than there was when we gave the opportunity after six months. This is partly true, because it gives rise to administrative savings, that digital conversations are slightly shorter than physical conversations, and there are many conversations early in the unemployment cycle. At the same time, however, there is an opposite effect because, as I said, digital conversations are considered to have a less employment effect than physical conversations. So, overall, the proposal will result in additional public expenditure and also in a reduction in the supply of labour, when you count on this sort of thing. The government can support the motion for a resolution that we are discussing at a forthcoming meeting how to increase the possibility of digital conversations also in the first six months of unemployment and how, if necessary, to finance it in the light of the cost of it. In this context, I think we will consider whether it is not a good idea to maintain that the first conversation between the unemployed and the job centre or the cashier should remain physical. This is also how I hear the recommendation when I met a number of job centre managers from Funen and South Jutland a few months ago, where we met. talked about how to provide better opportunities for digital conversations. I look forward to further discussion with the rapporteurs at a forthcoming meeting. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134230	Thank you, Minister. There are no brief comments to the Minister. That is how the rapporteur can begin, and the first rapporteur comes from the Social Democratic Party, and that is Mr Beazley. Henrik Møller. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134244	Thank you, President. It is the case that the active employment effort is one of the important legs in our Danish labour market model, and here the job centres play an important role, which is why I am also pleased that today we can have the opportunity to discuss how we improve the framework for the country's job centres. With this proposal, the Left will require the Minister of Employment to call for negotiations on the possibility of holding digital interviews in job centres and cashiers from the first day of unemployment. In other words, the Left will build on the partial agreement reached last summer by the Social Democrats on a rethink of the employment effort. With the June 2021 partial agreement, we agreed to give citizens greater flexibility and the opportunity to choose their own mode of meeting in a conversation with the job centre or the cashier after 6 months of unemployment. The proposal came in the wake of the good experience gained during the pandemic and the temporary suspension of employment efforts. This meant that a much larger part of the conversations between the citizens and the job centres or the cashiers were either held at a virtual meeting or at a telephone call, and what I thought was important about this was that it was a great satisfaction for both citizens and employees. That is why, of course, it is also important for us to pick up on the good experiences, and so I agree with both the proposers and the minister. As I said, the Left, with the proposal here, will go one step further. Where this summer's agreement extends the framework for talks after six months of unemployment, the Left wants it to apply from the first day of unemployment. You could say that there are two things in this discussion. On the one hand, of course, there is a less administrative burden to make calls rather than a physical conversation, but on the other hand we can also say that we must be just as sure that the digital conversations we are making have the same effect on employment as the physical conversations have. I personally believe that the first meeting of the unemployed person with the job centre or the cashier should take place physically. It is not certain that this is true, but that is the position I have, and it is both for the unemployed person to get a face on the system, you can say, but also for the employee to get a face on the citizen who is coming. Otherwise, I can at least be a little concerned that the effort will be too systematic and that we will lose the citizen-centred effort. But it can be said that these are some of the considerations which could be continued in a discussion at the meeting to which the Minister for Employment has also agreed, and I would like to look forward to those discussions from the Social Democrats, and that is why we can recommend the proposal from the Social Democrats.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134540	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There is no wish for short remarks. The next rapporteur comes from the Socialist People's Party, and that is Mrs Halime Oguz. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134603	Thank you, President. Today, we have to deal with the proposal of the Left to allow the unemployed to choose whether they want digital or physical conversations in job centres and cashiers from the first day they are available. The Corona has taught us many things, and in the field of employment we have seen that digital conversations can be an important and good tool in the interaction between the unemployed and the job centre or the cashier. Job centres and a-boxes have had many good experiences, and it is important that they are not lost now on the other side of the pandemic. That is why, in the SF, we appreciate the fact that with this motion for a resolution the Left is continuing the discussion on the possibilities for digitising employment efforts. SF believes that digital conversations have great potential as an integral part of the employment effort, and we are therefore sympathetic to the proposals of the Left. At the same time, it is important for SF to ensure that digital conversations do not become a saving exercise and that physical conversations continue to be possible. For not everyone is best helped through digital conversations. These things are precisely on the negotiating table during the negotiations, which are going on these weeks in the Ministry of Employment, and therefore the SF cannot support this otherwise sympathetic motion for a resolution. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134727	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Enhedslisten, and that is Mrs Jette Gottlieb. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134744	Thank you. I think this is an interesting proposal from the Left. Of course, they, for whom it is a relief, will love to be allowed to choose digital solutions. I am very concerned that the 20% is being kept under constant review. of the population for whom it is not a relief, but for whom even having to operate on the digital level is a burden. So it takes a lot more to come up with solutions, which is why it is important that there is freedom of choice, and the choice must be mutual. Having said that, I would also like to say that I think it will take more comprehensive solutions to find how to do the kind of procedure we are talking about. So at the moment I am not prepared to support the proposal either. But it may come later.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134833	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Conservative People's Party, and that is Mr. Niels Flemming Hansen. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134845	Thank you very much for that and I am sorry. It went faster than Enhedslisten used to be, and it was a pleasure. Thank you very much for this good resolution, which the Left has tabled here. The fact that the Minister has to call for negotiations on this is something we can easily support. We agree with the government in the idea that the first meeting could easily be physical it would be fine and then I have the individual remark that it should also be possible for the caseworker to call the unemployed person into an interview. Because you can also sit with a vacant person, where you do not feel that you have the contact or the like, and there must of course be an opportunity to do so. But we will look forward to getting the negotiations under way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134925	Thank you to the Conservative rapporteur. And then I can give the floor to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. And this is sir. René Christensen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519134937	Thank you. But the Danish People's Party also thinks that it is a sympathetic proposal that is made here. It is not so dangerous to require the government to call for negotiations. That's always a good way to do it. However, what we need to negotiate is also quite reasonable. We really want to do this about giving free elections to the municipalities. It is they who have the greatest interest in getting citizens into employment. And if it can then be that you can make a choice, whether you want a physical conversation or a digital conversation, that is something we would very much like to discuss. And we will look at that positively. So thank you for the suggestion.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135013	And thank you to the rapporteur for the Danish People's Party. I can now give the floor to the rapporteur for the authors of the motion, and that is Mr Seligman. Hans Andersen from the Left. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135027	Thank you. The Left has tabled this resolution because we believe it is important that free elections apply to as many places as possible in our society and therefore also in the whole area of employment. And this is about the job seekers who need to be given the opportunity to choose freely as to how interviews at the job center and the cashier should be conducted. And we have seen that this can be done to the satisfaction of a great many. We saw this during the corona crisis, where it was possible to hold digital conversations. And there are a lot of people who have gained experience with it and have become really happy about it. And that's why you could say that it was a step backwards, as it was no longer possible to hold these digital conversations from the first day. Now, after six months of unemployment, we want to move forward so that it will be possible from the first day of unemployment to be able to have a conversation either digitally or physically. It has to be a free choice. This will help both to improve employment efforts and to make it more effective, but also to increase the flexibility needed in employment efforts in job centres and in cashiers. As I have said, we have good experience of this, and the proposal here is of course that we in the Danish Parliament require the Minister to call for negotiations so that we can actually get it through here. And it is a very good day today, because I can of course listen to the fact that there is a majority in favour of the motion for a resolution, which requires the government to convene negotiations as soon as possible in the conciliation group that is applicable, and it is a conciliation group back from August 2018 to re-establish the possibility of holding digital conversations in job centres and a-boxes from the first day of unemployment. I can hear that the Minister supports this, just as the Social Democrats support it. So that is right, and I think that is something we should discuss here with the first day of unemployment or, frankly, the first conversation that needs to be made • whether it should then be a physical conversation to get to know each other. I would very much like to discuss this in the conciliation circle. I think it is crucial that we have this talk so that we can have an agreement so that we can legislate on it so that we can get started out there. In fact, I think there are a lot of people who are tripping to get started on digital conversations again. I regret that the SF does not immediately support the motion for a resolution. I understand that you find it sympathetic, but then it does not go any further on the part of the SF. The Enhedslisten cannot support the proposal, but I think that with the flexibility I am mentioning here, it should be possible for both Enhedslisten and SF to back it up, because we need to be able to find each other in this area. The digital age has come, and I actually think some people are having a really hard time today that could benefit from some digital conversations instead of physical attendance. And we can also help them to get moving more quickly in the labour market. Conservatives support it, and I also listen to the Danish People's Party support it. So, overall, I note that, in this way, there is massive support for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Left to restore free elections. And I look forward to the Minister calling for negotiations so that we can actually make that happen. And in those words, I just want to end this good debate. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135429	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur, and that is from Mrs Halime Oguz, Socialist People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135434	Thank you. And thank you for your speech, and thank you again for the motion for a resolution. It is simply not true that we do not support the intention. What I said on the platform was that, right now, there are some debates where we are just discussing this. For SF, it is really, really important that this is also part of the agreement, and that is what we are discussing right now. So it is simply not true that we do not support the intentions of the resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135505	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135505-2	I do not know what kind of negotiations the SF is taking part in on employment. What I am referring to is, in fact, a conciliation circle that we have left from 2018, where we simplified the employment effort, and that is what this conversation about digital conversations is anchored in, and it is also the conciliation circle that will have to nod to implement, if necessary, that this should apply from the first day of unemployment. I fully understand that SF is not part of the conciliation circle, and that is how it is, and then SF must seek influence in other ways. I simply note and welcome the government's support for this resolution, and the way in which it can be done as soon as possible is in that sense that we in the conciliation circle will agree to implement it, and I hope that the SF will also be able to agree to it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135555	Thank you to the rapporteur. Then there are no more brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the draft parliamentary resolution be referred to the Employment Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135609	The debate is open and the first to speak is the Minister for Employment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519135632	Thank you for the floor, and let me also begin by thanking the authors of the proposal. Today's resolution is about ensuring that we create the best framework for some of our society's most vulnerable citizens: citizens in homelessness. I would like to start by emphasising that it is absolutely essential that we as a society protect the most vulnerable citizens and that we set up a society in which the individual is not left on the platform while the rest of society roars by. With the proposal, the proposers want citizens in homelessness not to be included in what is called an ordinary job centre process, in the understanding that it does not provide room to focus on problems other than unemployment. And people in homelessness have problems other than unemployment. I do not deny that there can be individual cases in which, unfortunately, the procedure is not optimum, but I do not agree with the description underlying the proposal. After all, the Job Centres must put together their efforts in line with the specific needs of the citizens. Citizens experience very different processes depending on their specific situation and needs, and there is a natural difference in how a process is structured; whether it is the slaughterhouse worker who has been dismissed in a lay-off round, or a citizen who has other challenges than unemployment, such as mental challenges, lack of housing, abuse, etc. The legislation in the field of employment contains a number of exceptions designed to ensure that the employment effort can go hand in hand with, for example, social efforts. Efforts are adapted to the needs and life situation of the individual citizen. Citizens of homelessness who have problems other than unemployment are being searched as ready for activity. They will have a coordinating case officer who will coordinate social interventions, abuse treatment and housing provision. In addition, some active young people under the age of 30 may receive an activity supplement for their benefit. The visit takes place at the job centre and is absolutely crucial for their receiving the right effort and support. Special rules also apply to participation of interventions and offers, and there are special safeguards to ensure that vulnerable citizens who are ready for activity are not unduly sanctioned. Both ready-to-work and ready-to-work cash benefits recipients should not be available for the labour market, according to the rules in force, if they have a reasonable reason. Citizens can therefore already be exempted from being available, for example. work and offers if the municipality considers that they are too ill or if the health of the citizen is aggravated by the effort. And it is important that there is continuous contact with citizens in order to ensure attention to precisely the problems that apply to individuals, whether they are abuse, psychological challenges or otherwise. It is also through the case management in the job centre that attention can be paid to whether early retirement can be granted or whether the case should be submitted to the rehabilitation team, because citizens need to be in flex jobs or resource processes. And this is particularly important for vulnerable citizens who may otherwise find it difficult to navigate public systems. Today, the Job Centres play a key role in creating coherent offers to citizens where the coordinating caseworker is responsible for particularly supporting unemployed people who face challenges beyond unemployment. This requires multidisciplinary planning and action, where parallel efforts and a holistic approach must be the focal point for help and support for the citizen. Negotiations are currently under way on the holistic approach of negotiating to get municipal administrations to work even better together for the benefit of the most vulnerable citizens. If you choose to take citizens in homelessness out of the job centre, there is a risk that you will cut them off from the help they need in the system. In any case, it will be necessary to establish other systems capable of carrying out a number of functions of the job centre. The proposal seems to be based on the assumption that all other problems can only be solved before it is appropriate to embark on an employment-oriented effort. But that is not the case. There is evidence that efforts are being made for vulnerable target groups, including: citizens in homelessness, must build on job-oriented efforts early in the life of the citizens. The job-oriented effort must therefore be seen in conjunction with other efforts, and not as an independent effort, when the citizen has solved his or her challenges through, for example, social efforts. Early job-oriented efforts must be coordinated with and in parallel with the citizens' other challenges. And, for example, for people in homelessness, it may be that an effort with housing support must be made in parallel in the transition from life in homelessness to a life in their own homes. In addition, work is being done to offer meaningful activities in everyday life. For example, it may be business practice, ordinary pay hours or other employment-oriented activities. The job-oriented effort is one of the cornerstones of self-mastery, and a job can be a contributing factor out of homelessness. New experience has also been gained from, for example, the IPS method, which aims at getting people with serious mental illness in employment and education. For example, they may be people suffering from schizophrenia. The method is both nationally and internationally recognised. Popularly speaking, the method is a job first and then a support approach rather than a health first and then a job approach. We cannot escape the fact that employment and association with a workplace or educational institution provide meaningful communities that are invaluable to all and across all target groups. The Labour Market and Recruitment Agency has also carried out a number of initiatives in recent years aimed at implementing a job-oriented effort for vulnerable unemployed people. Here, the experience of jobs first and more must clearly point to the fact that the most vulnerable citizens benefit from job-oriented efforts. Several co-projects have also shown that there are job opportunities in the labour market for vulnerable unemployed people. Job centres therefore play a key role in helping citizens with meaningful activities, but also with the necessary balance and coordination between employment-oriented requirements and activities and the citizens' other social support needs. Citizens must meet with dignity, dignity and respect when they are in contact with the municipality or need help from the municipality. And the municipalities must pay particular attention to the challenges facing the homeless. However, exemption from job centre processes risks contributing to the failure of some citizens to receive the assistance they need, and therefore the government cannot support the proposal. I would like to thank again for the proposal, which helps to focus on important political priorities and discussions. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140310	Thank you, Minister. And there is a request for a brief comment from Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140315	Thank you so much. I am tempted to say Djøf, Djøf, Djøf, for it is unfortunately just a little like that. Not long ago, I had called the Minister in consultation on the way in which job centres treat sick citizens very badly. It was quite specifically with a case of a cancer-sick person who was in a coma and who had been called up for work experience. I'm afraid he's dead afterwards. It's just to say that there are plenty of these grotesque examples in the job centres, and this is another one of them. This simply does not make sense, because the fact that people are homeless is often due to a combination of having had some kind of life crisis and that you may also have some psychological challenges and perhaps even an abuse. So there are a lot of different things that need to be addressed. So I would just like to hear the minister: when the minister is repeatedly presented to these insanely exposed groups, whether it's sick, exposed or worn out, that's being costed around in an inhumane system, doesn't the Minister think it's really time to change the system and at least get these homeless people out of the job centres?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140427	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140428	Mrs Mette Thiesen can say Djøf as many times as she will, but that does not fundamentally alter the fact that we have to have some places in the systems where we can give the citizens the right help, because at least some of these citizens need help and support, including from public systems, to move forward. In fact, I share some of the criticisms made by Mrs Mette Thiesen in relation to some of the cases that have been made clear to us about the challenges that exist in some places in the job centres. It is also for the same reason that the government is rethinking the employment effort and the job centre effort, i.e. as part of a rethinking exercise, where we are among other things. must save some money, but hopefully also in the same sense make sure that there are a lot of things that are being done wiser. And my outrage at the fact that a specific job centre sends a call to a citizen who is terminally ill and asks him for some things that are not at all the basis of the legislation, does not change the fact that I think it is fundamental that it is also important for homeless citizens to have a social effort and help, also to get to work, because we actually know that it is also helping.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140542	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140543	Then I just have to ask the Minister: if you do not know where to spend the night when you do not know where the next meal will come from, does the Minister really believe that you are ready to be available on the labour market? Does the Minister really believe that it makes sense to start to cost people who are so messed up within them, who may have a mental diagnosis and perhaps even have an abuse and live on the street, around a system where what they encounter is an employment effort? They can't even shower. Do they have to go to a job interview without being able to shower?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140626	Then it's the minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140627	I do not think that Mrs Mette Thiesen heard my initial answer, for example she mentioned, with a citizen who, for example, has psychic challenges, who has all sorts of problems other than lack of work, should in fact often not be available for the labour market. But they still need help. Efforts still need to be made. It is, after all, an effort and help that are being discussed in the Ministry of Social Affairs these days. I think it is really, really good that the negotiations on holistic action have finally been opened, so that a clear link can be established between the aid that can be offered to those citizens, because they must obviously have help.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140703	The next brief remark is to Mrs Pernille Skipper, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140704	Thank you. homelessness, then it can be really, really hard to reach the goal. I think the Minister will agree with that. I would perhaps like to have just such a fundamental ideological answer as to whether the Minister believes that sanctioning people in the employment system, especially those with social problems, is helping them towards a life of employment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140753	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140754	As I also said in my initial answer, if you have major social problems, illnesses and so on, then you can and will be exempted from sanctions if you are not available. In other words, somewhere we have to make sure that the holistic effort is made, that that help is given to the citizens, and as far as I remember it may be, I remember wrong, because as I said, it is only from memory that the Enhedslisten has also advocated exactly this IPS method, which I had explained in my initial answer, where there is also a focus on trying to do several things at once, because it can also help people with major social problems into some meaningful communities, whether it is only a few hours a week or it is many hours a week.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140846	Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140847	As I also started by saying, we are not at all opposed to the fact that we also have an effort that is targeted at some kind of employment. It can start in the small area there are good experiences with the social free pass and there can be very many reasons why you should not rule out getting a job, including when it comes to socially vulnerable people. However, in the negotiations on the new main law, to which the Minister also refers, and which we are also in and are really, really excited about at last, it is, for example, that it has begun. A fundamental condition is that the system of sanctions in the employment system should be included, which means that, as such, the new main law cannot exempt people from sanctions in the employment system. We know it's happening. The minister says it wasn't meant to be, but it happens. So does the Minister not think that this is a problem which, like it does, prevents us from being fully in line with the new main law?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140935	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519140936	I think I will leave the negotiations on the new main law at the negotiating table and not negotiate on this. I think, in general terms, as I said in my opening answer, that it is important to say that there can be and, unfortunately, there are too many people in Denmark who have other problems than just the lack of a job, and our system must also take that into account, and I think that there is a broad framework for us to do today, but I also believe that we can easily be better able to take account of those people. These are some of the things we are discussing with each other when it comes to rethinking employment efforts. However, it is always a question of finding some balance, because, on the other hand, it is also crucial that if you are on public support and have no problems other than the lack of work, then of course we also have to ensure that people are actually available for the labour market, and that is the balance that we need to find.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141028	Thank you, Minister. There are no further brief comments to be made to the Minister. The next to speak is the rapporteur from the Social Democratic Party, and that is Mr Seligman. Henrik Møller. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141040	Thank you. This is, of course, a proposal which can be both empathetic and which can immediately also sound sympathetic, but I think it also leads to a discussion somewhere about what we do in relation to some of our most vulnerable and our very weakest citizens and how we solve their problems best, and therefore thanks to the proposers for putting it on the agenda. In the motion for a resolution, the authors of the motion for a resolution want citizens in homelessness to be exempted from normal job centre courses, and the proposers believe that the courses in the job centres do not allow space and space to focus on other challenges typically faced by homelessness citizens. In the Social Democratic Party we agree with the part where we have to look at some of the procedural requirements and at some of the bureaucratic stumbling threads that exist in the active employment effort, but I also think the Minister said that this is one of the things we have started to look at. However, I do not think that this is just something we should do in relation to the homeless, but that it is also something we should do in relation to young people without jobs or education, as we have already agreed on, or other groups in society. We simply do not agree with the proposers that the best solution is to withdraw them from the active employment effort and the job centres. Then I agree that in this context it is probably possible to pull some cases out of the drawer, where what you immediately see and what you experience screams a little to the sky, and where you think that it was not really the intention of the law, and that perhaps it was not where you try to start from the individual citizen. However, I think it is important to emphasise that job centres are not just the entry point for job-oriented efforts. They are also the gateway to coordination across social challenges, such as abuse problems and a lack of housing, and in that discussion I very much agree with the Minister in saying that if all the other things are to be in place before we can discuss employment at all, then we do not agree. For employment is one of the legs to stand on in the context of a holistic approach to this. Then I understand that there may be situations in this process and in the social effort where making the employment-oriented is not what is first and foremost in relation to this. But for me, it will still be a part of the effort that the job centre must contribute to delivering, and that is also why we in the Social Democrats basically believe that it is perhaps a little more nuanced than what is being presented. For the job centres, this plays a role in coordinating action, and this means that the job centre is essential for homelessness citizens to receive the right benefits. However, I also believe that there are elements in job-oriented action that can support not only the link between vulnerable citizens and the labour market, but also society as a whole. That is why it is also a concern for me and for the Social Democratic Party that, by taking the homeless out of the job centres, we risk cutting some of them off from some of the rights and opportunities that are in the system today. Of course, I would say that all citizens, whether they are ill, abusing or homeless, must meet with respect and eye level when they are in contact with this system and with the job centres. However, we do not believe that the solution to the challenges that may exist is to eliminate them completely, and that is why, unfortunately, we in the Socialist Group cannot support the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141427	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment and it is for Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141430	Thank you so much. It is clear, of course, that we in the New Citizen believe that the job centres should be completely closed because they create no value at all but for those who work there. But this is really about whether to take some of the most vulnerable in our society out of this inhuman system, the job centres. And now I would like to quote from an article by a lawyer from SAND, who was actually the one who made this citizen's proposal in the first place, as we saw in the New Citizens' Party raised up to a motion for a resolution, and she writes here in her chronicle: the Job Centre! The word alone helps to make it run cold down the backs of most homeless people. Not because these are particularly work-cloud elements that do not want to work, but because the good experiences with the Job Centre can lie in a very small place. Forced, no trust, stress, meaningless are some of the words most commonly used about the Job Centre among the homeless. What is the rapporteur's position on the fact that this system is so obviously not working, despite the fact that time and time again from among other things. The government's side argues that it does?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141540	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141541	There I think there are two basic conditions on which we do not agree, and one is whether or not to shut down the job centres, and I personally do not think so, and neither does the Social Democrats. The next is that basically it is a bad treatment that is given to virtually everyone who becomes part of the job centres, and I would say that I do not buy that premise either, and it is a little from the point of view of the fact that I have no doubt at all that there are these cases. There are a lot of citizens who I basically think will just be allowed to be at peace and not be required to do this. But that's just not our starting point. This is because we also believe that demands should be made on citizens, but it must of course be based on the situation of these citizens. I would like to say that yesterday we had a visit from SAND as a deputy in the Employment Committee, and there was no doubt that one of these homeless citizens had actually been given a flexible job. Some mention was made earlier about the social card, which is nice because you can choose to what extent it can be done. But I do believe that it can be one of the stones that can be stepped on into some kind of employment, and I think that is simply fundamental. We agree that people must be treated properly, and this also applies to the homeless, but we do not agree with cutting away this leg called employment.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141656	Mrs. Mette Thiesen, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141657	Thank you so much. Well, that is quite a recognition by the Socialist rapporteur. I really thought that the Social Democrats were those who would really like to keep their hands under those who are most at risk. And I hope that the rapporteur also agrees with me that it makes no sense to make demands, in relation to an employment effort, to some people who are so much on the verge of life as some of these homeless people are. So in relation to the fact that you obviously have to make demands: yes, to all those who can. But this is a very, very vulnerable group, and I just have to ask the rapporteur to take a look at the facts, such as how many jobs you are actually assigned to. There was this case in Copenhagen where it was zero. And I think there were 58 other municipalities in the metropolitan area where it was about the same. So they don't work, the job centers.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141746	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141747	Oh, I don't agree that the job centers aren't working. In other words, somewhere I also think that the job centres have had an effect on the whole of the development we have had in getting more people into employment. But again, the job centres are more and more than just providing jobs to businesses. It is also a coordinating effort. It is the granting of some of these benefits that is, and therefore you cannot only look at one part, but must look at the whole; at what is the job assignment of the job centres. And that's where I think we're just looking at differently whether we think it's something that should be there. And, if nothing else: if you close the job centres as New Citizens, then there will still be some work to be done elsewhere in the system. I think it is very well organised as it is today.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141829	Thank you, sir. Henrik Møller, and so I thank the Socialist rapporteur. Then a small exchange has been agreed in the rapporteur's line, and that is quite all right, so the next rapporteur comes from the Socialist People's Party, and that is Mrs Halime Oguz. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519141843	Thank you, President. We must now consider New Citizens' proposals that the homeless should be taken out of the job centres; a proposal which is a recast of a citizens' proposal from the autumn of last year. For us in the SF, the conditions for the socially vulnerable are a matter of priority, and it is precisely a vulnerable group, the homeless, which this resolution aims at. It is essential that homeless people, who already have enough to deal with, should not also be faced with demands and sanctions that could exacerbate their problems and undermine confidence in the authorities, which are actually there to help them. That is why we wholeheartedly support the intention behind this resolution; there should be no doubt about that. But that is also why the SF is taking part in negotiations on a new approach to employment where these very issues are on the negotiating table. There is a need for greater co-thinking of the whole area, which is one of the SF's main priorities for the negotiations, and just as far as the homeless are concerned, it will be a priority for the SF to include it. I think it is simply so unworthy of a country like Denmark that we have citizens who live and sleep on the streets. We must do everything we can there, in relation to both the social efforts, but also housing efforts, and there we have a very good agreement there almost six months ago, also in relation to the homeless, with both social work and housing for the homeless, so I am very proud of that. But we need to do more in this area, and I will certainly go ahead with this in the negotiations. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142050	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to the rapporteur. This is Mrs. Mette Thiesen, New Citizens. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142055	Thank you very much, and thank you to the SF for supporting at least the intention to do so and for bringing it forward as well. If SF means this, I'm thinking about something. I can hear that the rapporteur and I agree with the whole premise that it is deeply unworthy that these people are being whipped around in a system when they have so many other things to deal with and that one should focus on the fact that they sort of get it right and have a basis on which to get them into the labour market. Because basically, I also have confidence that there are many. The people I've talked to, they really want to, but they just need to get their lives together first. But why is it that the SF is not just supporting this resolution? For it actually specifically states that the government should alternatively convene the parties of the Folketing to negotiate a solution or independent investigation of the area.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142149	Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142150	Well, at least I wholeheartedly support convening a meeting. However, we have these negotiations, and this is part of the employment effort that needs to be rethought, because, as the rapporteur also says, there are a great many problems in the job centres. I fully agree with that. And we need to rethink the entire job center's efforts towards the unemployed. There is this which I have just spoken to Mrs Pernille Skipper about, and we therefore need to find out, like how we could possibly land a joint report in some way, because these people should not be hit any more in the head, at least not by the system.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142239	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142240	I very much agree with that, so it sounds very good that you will support it as well. Because these people are insanely important. As the rapporteur himself says, we can do better here in Denmark instead of costing some people around the system who are as vulnerable as they are. But let us look at it in committee. Anyway, thank you for the support from the SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142310	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142311	I would like to express my thanks to the new citizens for pointing this issue over and over again. So thank you for that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142322	Thank you to the rapporteur from the Socialist People's Party. The next rapporteur comes from the Left, and that is Mrs Anne Rasmussen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142330	Thank you for the floor. Today we have to take a position on a resolution from the New Citizens' Party that it is no longer the job centres that are supposed to help the homeless back into the labour market. And let me start by saying that I fully share the intention behind the proposal. I think it is difficult for us members of the Folketing to get to grips with the problems that many homeless people are struggling with. I am thinking here, among other things. on addiction, psychological problems or violent events that force them on the streets for a shorter and longer time. It is important that the encounter with a rigid public system does not become another problem for the homeless. If you don't know where to sleep tonight, it's hard to relate to an e-Boks call for a meeting with a case officer in 14 days. In the Left, we have always believed that the citizens will come before the system. Last time we had government responsibilities, we adopted an agreement that ended silo thinking so that citizens and families with complex issues can have a more coherent response. In the public system it has been the case for many years that various problems are dealt with in different silos. And citizens with problems in different silos were often met by a jungle of legislation and action plans and contacts when they needed public help. And with the principle agreement on a holistic approach, it was decided by a broad majority in the Folketing to put an end to the silo thinking in the public sector. Citizens with complex problems such as homelessness must meet with holistic efforts. We should not try to push individuals into the system's square boxes. And although I fully share the intention behind the proposal, it is not one that the Left can support. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the proposal is aimed at solving a problem that we already have full focus on resolving with the agreement on holistic action. Secondly, we do not believe that the proposal is the best solution to the problem. The aim of social action is to help citizens who have fallen out of society to return. The goal is that in time you must be able to stand on your own feet and have your foot under your own table; you must be able to take care of yourself. This does not mean that, as a homeless person, you have to sit and write job applications if there are other problems you need to be helped with first, but we need to see the social effort as a journey that has as its ultimate goal that you become self-supporting. The job center will also help with a holistic approach that looks at the individual. And this proposal doesn't have an eye for the individual. It will cut everyone off by removing all the homeless from the job center regardless of their social situation. So, although we fully share the intention behind the proposal, I can inform you that the Left will vote against it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142631	Thank you to the rapporteur. There is a request for a brief comment on the rapporteur, and that is from Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142636	Thank you. It can be very difficult to understand the people who are on the edge of society, as I said before. It gets a little easier when you go out and visit them and talk to them, and I have done so quite a few times now, because then you become aware of the rather small things that need to be done and whether they are quite specific problems that are, instead of everything being solved behind a desk, pure Djøf. That's what the job centres are. I just have to ask the rapporteur to deal with a specific quote from a homeless person, and it's also from this article in SAND: When you're on an eternal hunt for roofs and heat, you can't live up to their demands. Everything else that's messing up before you can figure out how to be available. If the rapporteur now hears all these examples of people, whether they are very sick people or people who are at risk and live on the edge of society, which is being costd around by the job centres, does the rapporteur honestly believe that the job centre system is working?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142744	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142745	I fully recognise that some people have had some really bad meetings with the job centres, and I also recognise that there are some municipalities that do not have control over when they can and should sanction those who are particularly vulnerable. However, I do not recognise the premise that social problems must be resolved before they can enter the labour market, and for some the way out of the social problems is indeed also the way out of the labour market. There are also a great many of these citizens who have a negative self-conception of their own abilities, and the fact that you enter the labour market can help you to get a different view, so that there are some who need you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142842	Mrs. Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142843	Okay, so what the rapporteur says is that the rapporteur believes that if you are homeless, you have a mental diagnosis, you have an abuse, you haven't showered for weeks, it gives a positive self-conception to be sent to a workplace. I simply cannot understand the arguments for this. I simply believe that the rapporteur needs to clarify it a little, because what you are hearing quite specifically is that some people have so many challenges to solve, and that is where we think we should focus on social action, and then we are actually confident that those people want to go to the labour market afterwards. It is not some people who just want to be parked somewhere, but they have so much to struggle with that they have to get solid ground under their feet before it is even relevant to talk about getting a job.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142936	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519142937	What we are discussing here is an individual effort adapted to the individual, and for some it may be a good idea to start by getting the social problems solved first and getting a home and getting out of the abuse, while for others it is somewhere else that they have to start. The good thing about the debate we are engaged in is that we give the municipalities the freedom to choose the process and method for themselves. That is why I just think it would be a shame if we were to start running the local authorities again by putting them from one box and into the other box.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143015	Then we would like to thank the rapporteur, and I understood that there were no more brief remarks. And if I've looked right at my note here, it's now Mrs. Pernille Skipper, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143039	I would like to start by thanking the authors of the motion for a resolution for making this proposal. It is an insanely important intention and debate that lies in what we in the Enhedslist can only agree with, in other words, completely. The Enhedslisten has an old proposal that reminds us a little of what is happening here, which is about introducing something we called a breathing space clause, in which a case worker under the Services Act could put the employment legislation out of effect during a period for people affected by homelessness, so that the social worker who sits with a citizen who is homeless or has an abuse or both or has other social problems can make a choice that if you do not shut down employment legislation and in particular the sanctions imposed by employment legislation, this will not work. As several speakers have said, and as the authors of the motion also mention, I entirely believe that chasing people around in an employment system does not make them less ill or less socially exposed or give them more courage in working life. This does not mean that you cannot both have a very strong desire and desire to get a job if you are socially exposed, because I have met a lot of people who have. I also fully agree that showing up at work and contributing and delivering something to the community, which everyone can, also gives something to one's self-confidence and self-esteem; and it is insanely important that one is not only obliged to work but also entitled to work. So I think that is absolutely crucial. In the Enhedslisten, we have perhaps been some of the biggest critics of the reforms where, in both the early retirement and flex jobs, but also in the cash benefits system, the basic thesis is that if you just hit people financially enough in the head, they will probably get up and find a job. In fact, I cannot even remember whether it is in the motion for a resolution here or in the citizens' proposal on which it is based, but the employment system is today designed in such a way that you are judged to be either ready for work or ready for activity, and if you are ready for work, you have to show up. Then it is true, as the Minister also says, that there are opportunities to exempt and that we should not sanction socially vulnerable and so on. And we hear the stories over and over again, which is why it calls for a proposal like this. That is why it also calls for us to deal more with this in the new main law, on which we hope to have an agreement soon. In any case, this is something that Enhedslisten has raised on several occasions in the negotiations, namely that we can just as well exempt those people who then fall under the new main law and give them the holistic efforts we all agree that the system should be able to deliver. Let us exclude them from employment legislation. Finally, I would like to call on the government to listen to where this is coming from. We are dealing with an extremely intricate system, which I hope we will soon make easier and easier together, but I also believe that there is a very great need for us to do something urgently for some of those who are most at risk. And I say that because in the Enhedslisten we have a desire not only to get out of this system, for those who are homeless, but also for those who, for example, are homeless. is too sick for a job. Listen to where it comes from. Let's do something that makes sense. The greatest chance is in the negotiations on the new main law, in which we can exempt the people who fall under it from sanctions in the employment system. So I would urge that again. So, Enhedslisten supports the proposal as such. I hope we can make a report that makes sense and that can bring us a little forward. Let's see if we can get enough votes together to get a majority behind it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143500	There is a brief comment on Mrs Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143501	Thank you very much, I would just like to start by saying to Mrs Pernille Skipper for the support for this. It is, of course, a resolution in which, when I read this citizens' proposal, I had no doubt that this was just a really, very good idea, and that is why I chose to bring it up as a resolution. So thank you so much. I have also mentioned this problem in connection with the holistic approach which we are debating over in the social field, precisely because it was also one of the major concerns I have, including the many discussions I have had with the homeless, among others. I would also like to mention those who have made the proposal here. So I would just like to say thank you, and let us hope that we can obtain a majority for that. At any rate, this will be speeded up, because I actually think these people that we are talking about, who are some of the most vulnerable in Denmark, deserve that. So thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143554	Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143557	Thank you, too.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143601	That's how you can make it short. Thank you to Mrs Pernille Skipper. There are no more brief comments, and then we move on to Mr. Niels Flemming Hansen, Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143607	Thank you very much for that, and thank you very much to the new citizens for putting forward this particular proposal. I think I'll start by saying that as a self-employed person I have been an active user of the job centres myself, and I'm actually still away from that, I'm just not in persona and that there's an incredibly big difference between job centres. There's a very big difference. I was recently in Esbjerg and visited a job centre and just have to say about the efforts they made, that I would urge the whole Employment Committee to take over and visit them. Because it was a pretty amazing experience. Job centres are often the focal point of action for citizens who have serious problems and users in other parts of the public sector, and many of them with psychological diagnoses, abuse problems and children's cases, etc. are also associated with the job centres. The core task of the Job Centres is to make an employment-oriented effort, but in order for it to succeed, and especially to create lasting solutions, they often have to move into many other areas too, and this also applies to the other way round, i.e. that jobs can help to create lasting solutions in other areas. But that being said, it's also very interesting to look at this Housing First. For many years there have been several projects in the job centres, in the employment system alone or together with the social area and health services around JobFirst, and it has been aimed at people and families with complex problems and built on a recognition that work is not only the goal, but perhaps also a means of bringing about lasting change in other areas. At the moment, we are engaged in negotiations on the holistic approach, which is, after all, over in the Ministry of Social Affairs, and we are anxious about when those negotiations will start again, and these are the ones we choose to follow. I hope, however, that we can land some kind of report on this and will look forward to seeing it, and then we will decide whether we can agree to what is coming.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143822	There is a brief comment on Mrs Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143828	Thanks to the Conservative People's Party for its speech, and we are in fact agreed that it makes a great deal of sense to start by giving people a home. What we have seen in this area, unfortunately, is that when you get a home, you have nothing to decorate it with. You may have lived on the street for many years, and you can't create a home, and it's insecure. So there's a lot of things involved in this. Then there are also some very low-practical things about that there are a lot of these so-called crooked homes, where you, for example. must not have a dog, and for many of these people who live in homelessness, it is their best friend, and of course it must be able to come along, and also if you have two dogs. So there are so many different and rather specific issues. But when we hear these quite grotesque things over and over again, where sick and vulnerable people are being whipped around in this job centre system, and I also know that the Conservative People's Party is a social party, I would really like to quote the rapporteur: it is very stressful that you do not know whether you get your money or how much you get; sometimes I do not even know what it is that I have not lived up to. That doesn't make you feel any better. What is the rapporteur's position on this?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143941	Thank you. The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143942	That is where the rapporteur says that the rapporteur believes that, if you have any doubts about it, you should go to the place where you can get answers to those questions, so that you know it. And that could be the case, for example. be at the job center.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519143959	Does Mrs Mette Thiesen wish to speak again? Yeah, go ahead.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144002	Sorry, I am going to accuse the rapporteur of a little bit of privilege blindness. So we're talking about some people who don't just have the e-box, who don't just manage calls and meeting times, and who like what to say, don't have a stable everyday life like the rest of us. So there you can suddenly experience this, and this is a concrete quote from a homeless person. So I just have to say to the rapporteur that it is not so easy to say that you just have to check your e-Boks or go down to the job center and ask. After all, these are some people who are on the verge of society and who need us to keep our hands under them.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144037	The rapporteur, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144038	I would also like to say that, just as the rapporteur from the New Citizens' Party has visited the homeless, perhaps I also think that the rapporteur should accept the extended hand that I am going with and go to visit, for example. The job centre in Esbjerg, where an evasive effort is also being made towards the homeless in order to deal with that particular problem.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144055	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we are moving forward in the rapporteur's line to Mr Beazley's report. Peter Skaarup, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144107	Thank you for that and thank the authors of the motion for a resolution for a fine proposal. There is no doubt that the vast majority of homeless people are in a very difficult and vulnerable situation, and they find it difficult to maneuver in that society, which may even be some privileged members of parliament sometimes find it difficult to maneuver in, namely the whole digital society with NemID and PCs and computers, you have to have access, you have to respond to the public's letters via e-Boks. It presents really big challenges. If some people even come up and say that, by the way, you're gonna have to take part in this job as a homeless perpetrator, as Mr. Niels Flemming Hansen mentioned, which you may be trying to do when it doesn't work the other way - well, the question is whether the chain really doesn't jump off for some homeless people. I think the homeless are very different. Some have been through abuse and cannot maneuver at all in anything. There may be others who, when they get out of the abuse, can and where a contact with a job center may be relevant. But basically, then, I think that the proposers are quite right in saying that it is not relevant and topical all the time and time again to have spun into this whole process around the job centres. Perhaps we should rethink the job centres and the function of those who need jobs in general, because they are very different, as a former rapporteur also mentioned. Some actually work very well, others do not work very well, and that is not where companies get their employees from. But back to the homeless. They are in a vulnerable and difficult situation, and I think that the rapporteur for the proposers has made some good comments here, and I really think that we should look at the actual text of the proposal here at the end. There is a call for the government to convene the parties of the Folketing to negotiate a solution or independent investigation of the area. That's a pretty humble approach. It's not something that has to cost anything. It is not something that needs to give rise to a whole lot of initiatives. So why not just support this proposal, like a unified parliament? Let's get started for the benefit of the homeless.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144340	Thank you. There is a brief comment from Mrs Mette Thiesen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144342	Thank you very much to the rapporteur. And as the rapporteur quite rightly says, this proposal simply requires the government to investigate the area and to find a solution to this. So I'm just completely in agreement. There are those who have also spoken about a report. I am very happy that people support it, but basically it is already in the resolution if you choose to support it by voting green for it in the Assembly. So thank you for your support for the Danish People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144413	Sir. Peter Skaarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144414	Then we sometimes have governments that are a little distinguished and cannot really accept the adoption of resolutions which have not been tabled themselves. One can only say that why really be so distinguished here, why not just say that this is a very fine proposal, and then let us adopt it, even if we are in government? So it must be the call for the Social Democrats to sort it out in this way.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144439	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we have come to the rapporteur for the proposers, Mrs Mette Thiesen, New Citizens.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144458	It is important to me and it is important to New Citizens that we treat the most vulnerable in our society well. Actually, we can't be anything else familiar. Unfortunately, there is a very long way to go for the homeless to get the help they need. The homeless in Denmark suffer more problems than just housing. Many times there are psychological challenges, addiction to alcohol and sometimes also drugs. It can be a vicious circle in which the psychological challenges are getting worse from dependence and dependence is getting worse the more psychological challenges there are. That is why a special effort is needed, but it must be about the human being not about djøfferi. Accommodation is not enough if the victim does not have the resources to care for his own home; and rehab is not enough if the victim also has severe psychiatric diagnoses. We have around 6,600 homeless people in Denmark. If you look at 18-29-year-olds, there has been an increase of 72%. Since 2009, when the number of homeless people was first recorded. That is worrying, and it also calls for action. The Council of Social Affairs Ministers has given their recommendations on how to act in this area, but the recommendations lack the involvement of those it is all about: the homeless themselves and they are not concrete enough at all. For example: The Council of Social Affairs Ministers is proposing that binding targets be set for the elimination of homelessness. Yeah, it's great, but how? The Council also proposes to allocate funds to the Finance Act to alleviate homelessness. That is also a good thing, but the problem is not primarily a lack of money. The Council also proposes that more prevention should be done and that the municipal authorising right to housing should be targeted. All the proposals are fine enough in themselves, but they do not come to the heart of the problem, namely that many times we are dealing with really vulnerable and vulnerable people with numerous challenges to be solved. It is not possible to solve complex problems by setting policy objectives and allowing the DJs to sort things out. We do not solve homelessness by flogging vulnerable people around the inhumane system of job centres. We must bring the homeless at the table to understand their challenges. I would really like to understand the personal challenges facing the homeless. That is also why I have met with them on several occasions, and that is also why we have raised this citizens' proposal as a resolution, because it is often these personal and low-practical challenges that are overlooked if you try to solve things behind a desk. For example, it can stand in the way of the homeless that they are not allowed to bring dogs in shelter or in the apartments to which they are assigned. This is an unacceptable obstacle to the homeless, because often the dog is the best and, unfortunately, sometimes the only friend of the homeless. So it's at the very low-practical level that we also have to take action to understand these challenges. This is not only done with overall political objectives that look good on paper and sound powerful. Nor is it possible to whip people around a system that simply makes no sense. When you don't know where to sleep, where to take a bath, and from where the next meal comes, then it's not the best starting point for a job interview or a regular job • it actually gives itself. So let us now separate social policy and employment policy and, at least, get the homeless out of the job centres completely. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519144915	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Employment Committee. And if no one objects, I consider it adopted. It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145016	I must point out that this resolution has emerged from a citizen's proposal. The debate is open, and it is the Minister for Employment first.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145024	Thank you for the floor. I would also like to start by thanking the promoters who have raised the citizens' proposal on equal pay between professional groups in the public sector. I would also like to thank the Members of Parliament who have chosen to table the motion as a motion for a resolution. In my view, it is an expression of a good and healthy democratic culture that we are discussing today an issue which concerns quite a lot of people, not least the government. The proposers stress that the pay in the female-dominated professions was fixed when, overall, they were placed at the bottom of the pay hierarchy with the civil servants' reform in 1969. The proposers also stress that the pay gap has been created politically and therefore requires political action. Equality and equal pay are issues on which the government has a great deal of focus and which we are also looking at with great earnestness. They are also complex topics where it is important to get the nuances included, it is not black and white. It is an absolutely central agenda for me and for the government that the pay gap between women and men must be combated, and it is no secret that there are wage differences between women and men across the labour market. The difference in pay is due to various factors, e.g.: the labour market is gender-separated and there are many reasons for gender segregation, which are often rooted in traditional ideas about male and female subjects and also gender stereotype expectations. In addition, the individual's own desires and preferences and perhaps also the expectations of family and associations when young people have to choose occupation and education. The government has a strong focus on creating a less gender-separated labour market. But I also have to say that there are no easy or quick solutions, that is rather the long, tough move that we are now focusing on. On 2 August this year, a new Orlov model will come into force. With the new rules, leave is now shared with maternity benefit straight between parents. Each parent has 11 weeks earmarked for the transfer of the other weeks to another. So here we have taken an important step towards ensuring equal pay by encouraging fathers to take greater part in the leave. I must also stress that it will not be possible to make an impact assessment of the impact of leave rules on men and women's pay. We are again talking about the long, tough move and, above all, about contributing to a change in culture and a new way of looking at the roles of men and women as carers. The authors and others in the debate refer to the fact that wages and the lack of equality of pay in the public labour market are the result of the civil servants' reform of 1969. Since 1969, wages and other conditions have been negotiated between the parties every two or three years, in accordance with the reform of the Civil Service Tribunal. In the various agreements, changes in pay conditions have been agreed, so there have been many reasons for negotiating wages, and the agreed wages must be seen as an expression of the parties' priorities, choices and opt-outs during the negotiations over the last 50 years. Agreements and agreements have been constantly replacing legislation since 1969. There have been many figures, many myths and stories about wage developments in the public sector and for the individual groups, and the government has therefore chosen, on its own proposal from the trade union movement, to set up a Labour Structure Committee. It is the Government's ambition that the work of the Labour Structure Committee should provide a solid basis for the parties' discussions on the major and complex issues of wage structures and equal pay in the public sector. In other words, it must ensure that there is a common picture and an understanding of what is up and down. We expect the work of the Labour Structure Committee to be completed by the end of this year. The pay structure committee shall support a broad analytical perspective on the wage structure and wage formation in the public sector, also in relation to the private sector, the gender breakdown of staff groups and the wage structure in a historical perspective. It is crucial that the work builds on the work of the Salaries Commission from 2010 and hopefully the Committee will discuss and carry out the necessary analyses which will form the basis for future collective bargaining in the public sector. The pay structure committee will also provide historical coverage for civil service reforms after the Second World War and rather than the development of a wage structure and collective agreements for public sector employees. So to return to the concrete proposal, it is the parties that agree terms and conditions of employment on the Danish labour market, including in the public sector, that is at the heart of the Danish model of agreement, and we must safeguard that. Tripartite discussions are an important tool in the toolbox for finding cross-cutting solutions on the Danish labour market, but it is crucial that the parties themselves take responsibility for solving the issue of pay. It is the government's view that future discussions on wage conditions should take place within the framework of the Danish agreement model. The report of the Wage Structures Committee will be a foundation for discussions between the social partners. It is the government's opinion that there should be no tripartite negotiations on equality in pay relations between public professions. We are waiting for the recommendations of the Wage Structure Committee to be able to negotiate on this basis at the forthcoming collective bargaining process. Against this background, the government is suspending the proposal for rejection. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145543	Thank you. There are brief comments. It's first Mrs. Pernille Skipper, Enhedslisten. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145547	This one with the framework of the Danish model is just about to be amazing! Then the trialogue is proposed, and then the Minister says it as if a debate about it was not within the framework of the Danish model and, moreover, when some of the parties tried to resolve it through perfectly legitimate strikes, the government ended up intervening. The government also needs to recognise that it is the government and the majority of parliament that set the financial framework for wage negotiations in the public sector. It keeps being such a fucked-up Catch-22. I would like to hear, because the Minister's reply did not quite state whether the Minister recognises that there is a shortfall in salaries as a result of the 1969 civil service reform and that this is part of the reason that this is not the whole reason for the unequal pay in the public sector.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145639	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145639-2	Yes, the tripartite institution is part of the Danish model, but it is not part of the wage bargaining model. We do not use tripartite agreements to establish pay and working conditions, either in the private or in the public sector. We may have many other elements in the tripartite agreements, but there is at least not before my best historical knowledge that wage terms have been negotiated as part of the tripartite institution. That is why we are saying that we actually think it is a sensible approach. It is also in relation to the second part of Mrs Pernille Skipper's question that the historical knowledge of what has had an impact, what has a branch left to the civil service reform, and what is due to elections and opt-outs in certain collective bargaining. After all, it has been very much in the debate that there are some professional groups with a higher basic salary and which have also given priority to wage increases on the basic salary, while other professional groups have given priority to better allowances. A great deal of the work of the Wage Structures Committee would be sensible, and we would also have some clear recommendations to put forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145744	Mrs. Pernille Skipper.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145745	Let us assume, and I do not think this is a wild guess, that the Labour Structure Committee will come to the conclusion that some of this has something to do with the 1969 civil servant reform. At least there are already a number of researchers who have revealed that it is part of it and that those structures from then on will still be found away in the pay relations between themselves, while the second of which, of course, has to do with the fact that there have been different priorities over the last many generations in the various subjects, but that certainly does not change the fact that the parties to the public wage negotiations, among other things, have been involved. We have a financial framework laid down by the Folketing and we have an equal pay problem which we also have a political responsibility to address.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145832	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145833	No, it doesn't. It is also for the same reason that the government has clearly said, also in the previous discussions that we have had, both in consultation and in the Parliamentary Assembly, that we will clearly follow up those recommendations. I have an expectation that that's what I think, but it's a guess, because I'm not part of the Labour Structure Committee's work... that the recommendations and analyses will point in many different directions. There is something that will point to the parties themselves, something that will certainly point to some kind of political action or reflection from Christiansborg, and something that will point to the way in which one sets out one another's demands on the employees side, where I at least seem to see that there have been some tendencies that one has also blocked for oneself.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145916	Thank you. Then it's Mrs. Astrid Carøe, SF. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145917	Thank you. I find it a little bit difficult to understand in the Minister whether the government is willing to act actively on the things that come from the Labour Structure Committee. Tripartite or not; it may not be exactly what it is going to end up with, but what the proposers want with this proposal is for the government to take responsibility and act as soon as possible; I also think as soon as possible, after the Committee on Labour Structures makes its recommendations. Will the government act on the recommendations that come?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145953	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519145954	The government has already said very clearly, and I am very happy to say it again: yes, we will follow up on the recommendations that the Labour Structure Committee will make. But I also believe that we must make it clear in advance that it will not be as simple as that I do not think it will be possible for the Labour Structure Committee to point out and say: if the Danish Parliament can get a certain amount of money that can be poured on top, then the problem is solved. Too much of this points to some rather complicated mechanisms for wage formation in the labour market, including in particular how employees set their demands. Well, it has, for example. For some professional groups, among others: Those who are the worst paid among the public employees have long been a desire to negotiate wage increases on the employee side in kroner and ear rather than in percentages, but that is something that is set out in the negotiation by the employee side. The government doesn't want to interfere with that. But I can have a personal sympathy for the fact that those who are least paid also have a desire to put an end to a method which leads to them getting the least part of the overall wage bargaining cake.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150101	Thank you. Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150103	But I also think that we have heard from the parties on several occasions, that the problem of unequal pay is a Gordian knot, and if it is to be solved, some money must be included, because it is so big. If that is what the Committee on Wage Structures concludes, that is, there is a great inequality between men and women in relation to pay in the public sector, is the government prepared to let money follow the recommendations that come in relation to finding the solutions that need to be based on the recommendations?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150130	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150131	But it all depends again on what the recommendations point in the direction of. For something that is also right, very important to stick to, is, after all, the link between wage developments in the private sector and wage developments in the public sector. It is, moreover, a context which, at least historically and also, I dare almost say, in relation to what it will be like in the future, will benefit public servants, namely that wage developments more or less follow the wage increases of private employees. And I think it is very important that we stick to that principle and not override it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150209	Thank you. Then it's mr. Peter Skaarup, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150211	I think it is interesting to follow the comments that have been made here. I think the Minister speaks a little black. It may be that the Minister, with another speech, can be put on the right track, and that is what I would like to do here. The real question is whether the government, on the other side of the committee's reporting, will seriously take into account the positions that might be called for tripartite negotiations and get it started in a way that, as an employee or potential employee in the public sector, believes that something is going to happen. Then I would also like to ask whether the government really regrets the intervention of nurses. That's why you have this committee at all. We have a situation now where recruitment is incredibly bad. It is difficult to get nurses; there are too few who seek. This could be linked to the fact that the government was just rolling over people and today does not really give a commitment to take the committee's recommendations seriously.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150315	Thank you. The minister, please.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150316	Firstly, I would like to give the undertaking that we will take the recommendations of the committee seriously. But that does not mean that I can promise in advance what concrete steps it will take if I do not know the specific recommendations. Secondly, I do not agree with the idea that the government was rolling over the nurses in the conflict there was. The conflict was allowed to run for more than 10 weeks. We exalted the mediation bill negotiated by the nurses themselves, which, moreover, contained the same wage increases as all other professional groups. I would say that I am sorry it came to this, but I am not sorry that we ended up at the request of others. both sides to intervene in a conflict that appeared and seemed in every possible way to be unsolvable to the parties themselves.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150402	Sir. Peter Skaarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150404	I can just say that's the impression that's out there, right? That is the impression among nurses that the government was an elephant in a glass store and had to be dragged around for some things. And then I do not really think there is a proper commitment today to do anything. Then you send out honey hearts, so it's kind of a joke among these nurses, how the government works with these things. I just think that, in the light of the answers that have otherwise been given, the Minister has to give an assurance that something is going to happen, that the whole thing is being taken seriously.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150437	Thank you. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150438	I say it again: I think it is now the fifth time during this reading and with only three questioners: the government gives the undertaking that the challenge of equal pay, which is clearly being discussed, is one of them, but of course only in general, because there are a number of the groups we are also talking about, among the public employees, where we are obviously like Mr. Peter Skaarup says ▪ has recruitment problems. That is where we have to look at the mechanisms that form part of that solution. However, I cannot promise in advance what concrete initiatives will be.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150517	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. Then we start the rapporteur's round. First, it's sir. Lars Aslan Rasmussen, Social Democracy.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150536	I should like to begin by thanking the initiators of the citizens' proposal here for bringing up an important matter in the Folketing. It absorbs the Danes, and it means a lot to their everyday lives. I share the concerns of the proposers about the major recruitment and retention challenges that we have in the welfare sector. It is the civil servants who are the most important resource in our welfare institutions. It is not a lack of welfare workers that we are discussing today, but it is more concrete equality in pay relations between public professions, an issue which is very dear to me and the Social Democrats and which we are very concerned about. It is our ambition that there should be equal pay for equal work in Denmark. Unfortunately, we have still not achieved that and, unfortunately, unequal pay conditions are not something that we simply remove by screwing on individual buttons. This requires more structural measures, because we know that a large part of the explanation for unequal pay, among other things. must be found in our gender-separated labour market. VIVE has shown in a study of the unexplained part of the difference between the hourly wage of women and men that the more women employed in the same job function in a job, the lower the wage. At the same time, men are generally placed in higher positions in the hierarchy. This does not make the pay gap any more reasonable, but it shows a link between the gender-based labour market and an unequal pay in the public sector, and that we must also look that way if we are to tackle the root of the challenges of unequal pay seriously. In order to influence the structures of the gender-based labour market, we have among other things. adopted a new proposal which obliges public institutions to set targets and policies to promote more women in management and in boards. Another explanation for the unequal pay may also be the unequal distribution of the barsel. Where new mothers in 2019 averaged 280 days of maternity leave, fathers held 34 days of maternity leave in the same year. It is also the fathers who work several hours a week and the mothers who are more often employed part-time. As the Minister mentioned, we have also adopted a new model of leave to ensure a fairer distribution of the bar between mother and father. Hopefully, the new model of leave can contribute to the cultural change that is needed if men and women are to be treated equally. In addition, we have set up a pay structure committee to provide a technical basis for discussing wage structures in the public sector and to which the government has committed itself to follow up. The Council of Ministers and the European Parliament are currently finally negotiating a directive on the transparency of pay, on which we will also have to take a position here in the Folketing at some point. The directive also aims to promote equal pay between men and women. Of course, many different initiatives have been put into the sea, and although I am not necessarily convinced that the initiatives are going to move much here and now, I believe that we are helping to bring about the structural changes that are needed if we are to put an end to unequal wages in Denmark. Social democracy is not going to support the citizens' proposal here. This is not due to unwillingness, as I hope it will also be apparent from the things I have mentioned, but with the citizens' proposal, the proposers want the government to call for trialogues. We Social Democrats are very much in favour of the parties solving common challenges in close cooperation, but we are also in favour of the Danish labour market model, where wages are negotiated through the collective bargaining system. Therefore, future discussions on wage conditions must still take place under the Danish model of agreement. Equal pay in the Danish labour market is a more nuanced issue which it is important to relate to, but which must also take place within the framework of a broader perspective. That is why the Social Democrats cannot support the citizens' proposal, and I should also like to welcome the radical rapporteur, Mrs Samira Nawa, who is unfortunately ill, and say that the Radical Left cannot support the proposal either.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150913	There is a brief comment on Mrs Astrid Carøe, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150916	Thank you. I would just like to know if the rapporteur could say a little more about how it can be that, in this case, a tripartite agreement cannot be reached when the Socialist Government is standing up and saying again and again proudly: we have now reached a tripartite agreement on that and that. But right here a tripartite agreement is excluded; there is no possibility. Why?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150937	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150938	That is because it is something that is agreed between the social partners, as the Minister has also explained. I also think it would suit SF to wait for this equal pay committee to come up with its proposal, and then look at what they say. I think that is in everyone's interest, and I suppose it is something that the SF has been happy about.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150953	Mrs. Astrid Carøe.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519150954	It makes absolutely sense now that we have set up a pay committee, but it also comes up with its proposal soon, so if it is to be as soon as possible, it may well be after the pay committee has finished its work. But the parties themselves say this is a Gordian knot, that more money is needed in the system... is the Social Democratic ready to put more money into this system so that we can solve the problem of unequal pay? Because we can't do it without it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151017	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151018	Now we've set up this committee, so shouldn't we all try to see what it comes with and then look at it? I think the Minister has been very clear about wanting to follow up on these things. I hope that is a satisfactory answer.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151029	There are no more comments. We go further in the rapporteur's round, and now it is Mr. Hans Andersen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151038	Thank you. The proposal we are considering today aims to commit the government to political action in order to achieve equality of pay between public professions. First of all, the position of the Left is that when it comes to pay, it must be established by agreements and agreements between the social partners in the field in question. In the Left we are very concerned about protecting the Danish model, and we will not risk undermining it by the fact that issues of pay are drawn into Christiansborg. This does not mean that the Left does not recognise that there are challenges in relation to wage differences between the sexes. The difference in pay is largely due to the gender division that exists in the Danish labour market, and therefore the Left would also like to see a political debate on the barriers that can be removed in order to break the gender-separated labour market. The pay gap between women and men is not a simple problem and it is not a problem that can be resolved overnight. However, it is clear that we need to look at the possibilities that exist in order to avoid a radically gender-separated labour market. Then we must not forget that there has been the establishment of the Wages Structure Committee, which has also been discussed by the previous rapporteurs and the Minister. After all, it has been set up in the wake of Parliament's legislative action, which ended the dispute in the nursing sector this summer, and the committee has the task of examining the wage developments in the public sector. Hopefully, we can look forward to the publication of its work by the end of 2022. The Left looks forward to and awaits the committee's report and its results. We see no reason why we are making hasty decisions here and now which we should take on the basis of the report by the Labour Structure Committee. The Left recognizes that this has been a contribution to the debate today, but on this basis we cannot support the proposal. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151248	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. This means that we can move on to Mrs Astrid Carøe, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151255	Thank you. I would also like to begin by thanking the authors of the motion for a resolution for once again raising an important debate on equal pay and for keeping this debate going in general. There are a lot of other things going on around the world that are also important, and therefore this area can quickly be forgotten, and it is important that it is not. Although we are 2022, traditional male and female occupations are still not equal. We have proved this over and over again in research, reports and studies. It is the civil servants' reform that has left behind a sexless legacy and a gendered unequal pay among public servants. This has major consequences for those people who, every day, lift huge responsibilities in hospitals, in nursing homes, in kindergartens and in many other places in the public sector, and whose wages do not in any way reflect their responsibilities. And so it also has a really big impact on our society in general. The core of our welfare society, the care sector, is in need, because it is really difficult to maintain and recruit nurses, sosus, midwives and many other welfare workers out there in the public health sector because of the poor wages and working conditions that mean that many people are opting out of work. This also means that our old and sick are in overcrowded hospitals with far too little staff, that our babies do not get the necessary help and quiet to welcome a small new one, and that adults are lacking in kindergartens. If we do not take political responsibility, I am nervous that our welfare will suffer even more in the future. For example: We see that fewer and fewer people apply to the courses leading to these subjects. We do not dream of such a future, neither I nor SF, and therefore we must take the responsibility of ending the petrified structures that put the value of care work as low as it is done. For us, therefore, it is not enough to make recruitment and retention initiatives. So do we, but we also need to find money for a new and fair wage structure. In the SF, we believe that it is absolutely crucial that the government takes responsibility and solves the problem of unequal pay, and when the Labour Structure Committee comes to its conclusions, the government must ensure a long-term and sustainable solution, and money must therefore follow. In this context, I would also like to stress that it is very important for us that such money results in real equal pay on the other hand. I believe that the government must take responsibility for ensuring that process and for involving the parties when the Labour Structure Committee comes to its conclusions. Because I fully agree that now that we have set it up, we must of course see what recommendations it makes, but there is no doubt that there is unequal pay in Denmark between men and women. So we can already see that we have to do something about that. Employees in traditional women's professions play an absolutely crucial role in our society, and they must, of course, have pay and working conditions that reflect it. We agree with the citizens' proposal and look forward very much to when the Wages Structure Committee makes recommendations, and we hope and hope that at that time we will see a majority that will really do away with the unequal pay that we see in Denmark.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151621	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we move on to Mrs Pernille Skipper, Enhedslisten.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519151638	Thank you. Like the previous speaker, I would like to start by thanking the people who have tabled the citizens' proposal and who have signed the citizens' proposal and who have not given up, and that is the most important thing, that is to say, that there has been no giving up. The citizens' proposal here already has a long history of unequal pay in the public sector, which has been documented among other things. As a result of the 1969 civil servants' reform, as the Minister for Employment said in a final consultation, it was something that had to be resolved in the collective bargaining process, and then the nurses voted no. They were not the only ones who did so, but they were the only ones who went on strike and tried to use the collective bargaining system for it, and they were then met by government intervention. And I can hear it when the government says that they do not believe that they have rolled the nurses, but it was certainly not the nurses who had the attitude that they had to stop their strike at that time and that they were in the finish line. So I think it felt like that. What is crucial is that nurses, social workers, educators, so-called social workers, kitchen assistants, ergotherapists, physiotherapists, social educators and all the other employees in women's professions in the public sector end up in a catch-22. It is like no matter what they do, it is not the table on which they have tried to place responsibility, which is the right table. If you try through the collective agreement system, you are told that you are a socialist function that cannot stand to strike for so long, and if you try through the political path, you are told that it is not a political responsibility, but that it is something that the parties relate to in the Danish model. What is positive is that we have finally come to where the government has changed their response, which has otherwise been the Danish model, with a pay structure committee, and that is, after all, a step in the right direction, because it means that we now have an employment minister, a former Minister for Gender Equality, who is standing here saying that it needs to be followed up. We in the Enhedslist want the government to go the small, but absolutely crucial step further and say that it is also willing to put the money in the follow-up that it needs. Because it is certainly true that if we want to ensure that there is not the unequal pay between women's and male-dominated public professions, there must then be some money in it, unless what we are prepared to do is that all the women's domination professions should take money from primary school teachers and police officers, and I do not think you are. At least I haven't met a single person who thinks that's the way forward. However, I acknowledge what the Minister has also said several times, i.e. that it is complex when the money is to be distributed, and that is why the Enhedslisten's proposal has been many times it is actually being over several decades that we are taking and giving a bag of money for the collective bargaining, which is earmarked for equal pay and in relation to low wages, and which can then be distributed by the parties in a usual negotiation for that purpose. For, of course, we should not from the political point of view regulate the individual subjects, but we do need to indicate to the parties that there is a political will to finance it. Because in the Danish model it is admitted that the money comes from in here, and whether it is the regions or the municipalities or the state that are in wage negotiations, the money comes from in here, and if more funds are to be provided, it is up to us in here to make a political decision about it. So both because the civil servant reform back in 1969 was politically created and here the various subjects were placed in an unfair wage relationship, which today means that women's occupations and male-dominated occupations are unequally paid, even if they have the same length of education and the same responsibilities, but also because, in the end, no solution can be found in the so-called Danish model, if no money comes from it, then we have to assume political responsibility. The Enhedslisten, of course, supports this citizens' proposal and we will love to vote green on it, just as we will continue to press everywhere we can to ensure that there is money for the follow-up promised by the government with the Wages Structure Committee. Because without that money, it's hard to see a way forward.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519152137	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we move on to Mrs Britt Baker, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519152144	Thank you. Today we are discussing a citizens' proposal based on the basic premise that the civil service reform committed a systematic injustice back in 1969 and that it has remained unchanged ever since. I would like to emphasise that wages are negotiated between the social partners, including in the public sector. This has ensured a high level of pay in Denmark and a flexible and adaptable labour market, and we should safeguard that. As a whole, wages in the public sector are at the same level as the private market. If wage increases are given in the public sector, then the public sector will become a wage leader and press wage also in the private sector, and this will mean that the export industries in the private sector and thus Denmark as a whole will lose competitiveness and welfare. It is probably part of the problem that unions in the public sector cannot agree on how wages should be distributed. For example: the teachers and the djøfs, who are relatively high, are not interested in giving money to the sosu and the educators. There is a real problem, but it is also a fight which the federations must take with each other. It is not possible for their differences to be resolved by the fact that we, from a political point of view, are short-circuiting the Danish labour market model by distributing politically determined wages. The pay structure committee was set up by legislative action, and the pay structure committee has to submit its report by the end of 2022, and here they also address the regulation system and the standard wage index against the implicit wage index. We simply have to wait for their conclusion before we go further into this entirely relevant debate. Against this background, the Conservative People's Party cannot support the citizens' proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519152342	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that means that we go further in the rapporteur's line to Mr Vandemeulebroucke. Peter Skaarup, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519152358	Thank you very much for that, and thank you to the organisers of this very fine citizens' proposal that we are discussing in the Danish Parliament today. One year ago, we discussed the same proposal in this Chamber, namely on 20 May 2021, with the exception of 1 day. And it is actually interesting to look back when we have this debate today on what was then promoted during that debate. If we recall, it was in the middle of collective bargaining, and at that time it was enough for the government to reject the proposal because it was thought to be premature. And today we are faced with the situation that we are awaiting the Labour Structure Committee, which was the result of the discussion on the results of the civil service reform and unequal pay in collective bargaining. The fact is that today we are also in a situation where we have actually heard from the government that we are not prepared to look at this proposal until this committee has barred. And I also think that maybe it's okay and factually enough, because this committee is set up, and it's gonna be exciting to see what it's gonna come up with. Then we will have to discuss the issue at that point in time. Because there's actually something on the table we can use for something. And, by the way, you have to use it for something. We think this question is a very fundamental one, because it simply contains the hops in some of the major challenges we face in the labour market today, where it is very difficult to recruit in certain subjects because you feel run over, you do not feel that the wage level has been followed over time in some of these different subjects. We need to be able to think back here, that is, when we look at the civil servants' reform in 1969. For the basis of it was created from what is called a structural pay hierarchy, which in parentheses dates back to 1919. And when you look at it, it really seems quite obvious that there is a bias. Whether this bias is due to the fact that in a 1969 the man was still considered to be the main attempt by the household and that the woman's salary was just a supplement to the housekeeping, or whether it is about e.g. In 1969, the nursing education was a student education and that today, of course, it has developed a lot since then to be what you might call a bachelor's degree programme. What is crucial is that there is an imbalance and that it is an imbalance that we should put in place a plan to remedy. It has been discussed earlier in the debate between the rapporteurs what is then done. Well, we've been struggling with this for 50 years without being able to move anything, and it's kind of a house with a crooked foundation. We can make all the walls a little higher, even at different paces, just like these minor adjustments between wage groups, which can be dealt with in collective bargaining. But if the house really has to be properly founded, and if it is to work properly, then the foundation must be restored, and that requires a more general decision. Now we are faced with a citizens' proposal which is proposing tripartite negotiations with a view to achieving equality in pay relations between public services, and that is something we can hardly be opposed to. But in order to have this basis for such tripartite negotiations, it would be appropriate to wait for the results of this committee, which is expected to come in November, and at that time you can look at the things that the committee is set up for. It is, of course, just to review it and to highlight the possibilities for developing wage formation in the public sector within the framework of the Danish public contract model, including what opportunities and potential barriers there may be for ongoing or more fundamental changes in the wage structure in the public sector. So it is, of course, absolutely crucial how the government feels about using constructively the results of the Labour Structure Committee's work. And I still think that we really do have the benefit of hearing exactly how you intend to do it and I can see how you nodded from rapporteurs in this Chamber. We haven't really been able to get a handle, a road the government wants to use. So I hope that the government will bring it soon and that we will also take stock of the shortage of labour in some of the sectors we are talking about here.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519152905	Thank you. There are no brief comments, which is why we thank the rapporteur. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Committee on Gender Equality. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519152923	I can see that we have both the Minister and the rapporteurs present, and that is why the debate is open. First, it's the Attorney General.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519152954	Thank you for the floor and thank you to the Left for tabling the motion for a resolution. As you know, it is now the criminal justice system which has the power to decide whether a person sentenced to unconditional imprisonment for up to six months should be allowed to serve with electronic ankle bracelets. The authors of the motion for a resolution want this power of decision to be left to the court. Let me say straight away that I understand that the Left wants to make proposals with the aim of creating simpler and more flexible procedures in the treatment of criminal cases. That is an ambition that I fully share. However, the transfer of decision-making powers to the courts will not solve the problem of lengthy processing times, and this will not lead to a simpler and more flexible procedure, on the contrary, and I will try to clarify that. This is not the first time that the question of the transfer of decision-making powers has been raised. The question was also raised during the negotiations on the multi-year agreement, which the government entered into on 15 December with the Danish People's Party, the Socialist People's Party and the Conservative People's Party. There are several strong arguments against the proposal, and the most important thing is that a transfer of decision-making powers will prolong the time of proceedings in the criminal proceedings chain. The proposal thus contrasts with the continuous focus of the government and a number of parties in the Danish Parliament to reduce the duration of proceedings in the criminal proceedings chain. The government has taken a number of initiatives to achieve that goal. Both the latest police settlements and the multi-year agreement on the criminal justice economy of December are taking place with initiatives to reduce the length of proceedings. In addition, work has been started to find more concrete measures to strengthen the case-law and to reduce the length of proceedings across the entire criminal proceedings chain. The purpose is that the period between the crime being committed and the convicted person begins to pay his sentence is shortened as much as possible. If the question of ankle shackle settlement is to be settled by the court, it will impose considerable extra work on the courts, with substantial additional costs for the courts. It is the judgement of the Court of Justice that it will require longer hearings and thus put further pressure on the timings. This would therefore have a negative effect on the time of proceedings in the criminal proceedings chain. Further work will also be entrusted to the national courts if an anklet settlement is to be considered in connection with the delivery of the judgment in criminal proceedings. This is because the city court's decision on ankle shackle settlement will have to be appealable. However, it is not only the courts that are judged to be affected by extra work, it is also the opinion of the criminal services that the transfer will result in substantial additional costs for the ankle chain system and extra work in the criminal services. In fact, it is the criminal services which carry out the suitability assessment which forms the basis for assessing whether an ankle bracelet can be served. With the motion for a resolution, unlike today, this suitability assessment will also have to be carried out prior to the hearing, which means that criminal services may end up using resources to carry out investigations in cases where ankle bracelets are not even open, either because the defendant ends up being acquitted, has a suspended sentence or is sentenced to more than six months in prison. And if the court's decision on ankle shackles is based on an aptitude check, it is the opinion of the criminal services that, in any case, there will be a need for the criminal services, following the sentence, to re-evaluate whether the sentenced person can serve with ankle bracelets. This is due to the fact that the employment and housing situation of the convicted person may have changed and new charges may have been made which have led to the conviction no longer being suitable to serve with an ankle bracelet. Overall, it is the opinion of the Department of Justice and the Court of Justice that the cost of the ankle chain system with the proposal will be significantly increased, because additional costs of the procedure and the changed procedures will have to be expected and, above all, the proposal will have a negative impact on the processing times throughout the chain. For the government, it is absolutely essential that the duration of proceedings in criminal proceedings is not further extended and that, in general, as effective proceedings are ensured across the criminal proceedings chain as possible. A transfer of decision-making powers will impose both additional work and substantial additional costs on the courts and criminal services, and the Court of Justice also considers that a transfer of decision-making powers will mean even longer time periods in the criminal proceedings chain. After all, it is important that we have a legal system that quickly and effectively brings justice to the victims. The people who fall victim to crime must be properly taken care of, and that includes not having victims waiting for months, sometimes years, for criminal proceedings to be settled, and we are not good enough to ensure that today, and we must do better. The challenges of the long duration of proceedings have been a key priority for the government, and for that reason we also believe that, in general terms, there should be careful consideration in relation to changes where there is a risk of extending the duration of proceedings, in other words, we do not think that imposing on the courts also to take a position on this issue in the context of criminal proceedings and thus prolonging the proceedings is the right way to go, and that is why we cannot support the motion for a resolution. Once again, I would like to thank the authors of the motion for a resolution for highlighting a relevant subject. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153456	Mr President, there is a brief comment to make. Preben Bang Henriksen, Left. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153459	If the information obtained by the Minister can be taken as a basis, I fully agree with the Minister; but I have to say that if you ask the Court of Justice or the judges for a change to this, you almost know the answer in advance: send more money. So these will be words that we will, unfortunately, hear a lot about in the future. No, I have to ask the Minister: how does this extend the duration of the proceedings? We have a person who just got six months in prison sitting in front of the judge. Today, when he goes out of court, he doesn't know if he's going to jail or not. This is something that some people sit in the department of criminal justice and decide at a later stage. This proposal lays down that the judge may interrogate the person concerned. The judge may ask about the person's personal circumstances. The judge has the personal examination under § 808 in front of him. The judge shall have any additional information. There is every conceivable information in front of the judge that cannot be an extension of the duration of proceedings.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153601	I think the English phrase can be translated into: Send more money. Here you go, Minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153607	Thank you. It is the opinion of the Court of Justice that a transfer of decision-making powers will impose considerable extra work on the courts, including: because more information needs to be posted in connection with the hearing, and voting will take longer. Then I think that one of the crucial things is that if you do not have to serve in an ankle chains, you will also have the opportunity to appeal. This will send even more cases to the next judicial body. I therefore agree with the fact that I have also read some of the speeches made by the rapporteur in some newspapers that it may seem a little strange that one can walk out of the courtroom and have received an unconditional sentence on, let us say, four months, but not know whether to serve in an ankle bracelet or not. But I also think it must mean something that we try to avoid extra work being put into the courtrooms where we already have too much difficulty in getting the hearings scheduled.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153709	Sir. Preben Bang Henriksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153710	I therefore agree with the Minister that we must also avoid extra work and avoid extra costs and so on, but here there is the cost of court proceedings. What I am talking about is, of course, taking that money from the Department of Criminal Procedure and putting it to the courts so that more money is sent. The money follows the proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153733	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153734	So what I have at least been informed is that there will still have to be an aptitude assessment before the judge decides whether to serve in an ankle bracelet or not, and that another suitability assessment will not be avoided later on. That is why I can also see the factual objections to what is actually a very sensible idea, as I myself thought, when I read the rapporteur's speech.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153805	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief comments. Then we'll start the rapporteur's round first, it's Mr. Knox. Bjørn Brandenborg, Social Democratic Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519153819	Thank you for that, President. The motion for a resolution calls for the transfer of decision-making powers in the field of electronic anklet service. In concrete terms, the authors of the motion for a resolution want it no longer to be the criminal services that decide whether a convicted person should be allowed to serve with an electronic anklet. Instead, according to the proposal, it must be the court dealing with the criminal proceedings; and because the court already knows the case in question and yet has to take a decision, it may well be inconvenient to allow the court to take a position on the question of an ankle bracelet. As we have just heard the Minister of Justice explain, this is also a solution that has previously been turned around. The challenge, however, is that this solution will probably in practice extend the duration of proceedings in the criminal proceedings chain. The courts themselves consider that it will take longer hearings to take a position on the question of an ankle chains, and it will also unnecessarily push an already cramped court area. It is also the assessment that it will cost more resources in the criminal services, which will still have to carry out the suitability assessment which forms the basis for assessing whether ankle bracelet can be served. When both the courts and the criminal justice services consider that a solution such as the one proposed would cost a lot of extra resources and mean longer processing times, and when we know what the various pressed links in our criminal procedure are and have been for a long time, then we do not think the proposal is appropriate. So we cannot support the proposal. However, I think it is good that we continue the discussion on how we can optimize our cramped criminal justice chains. And I am pleased that the challenges of long processing times are a key priority for the government. We must have a well-functioning criminal justice chain so that we can solve crimes as quickly as possible and punish those who are guilty so that victims can have clarification and not have to wait. We cannot support the proposal, and I should like to say from the Enhedslisten that they cannot support the proposal either. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154014	Mr President, there is a brief comment to be made on this point. Preben Bang Henriksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154016	I shall spare the rapporteur the same questions put to the Minister. I have a strange feeling that it will probably be about the same answer. So we leave them alone. On the other hand, I would like to ask the rapporteur a question about the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs looked at this matter and exactly the same proposal, and on 26 March 2015, the Committee on Legal Affairs, including the Socialist Group, issued a report, and I quote from that: "The Courts should therefore be able to decide, in the context of the imposition of sanctions, that the person concerned should serve his sentence by using electronic ankle chains if the personal circumstances of the convicted person make this practical. The courts should also be able to decide that anklet service should not be possible. In this way, both the courts and the Directorate of Criminal Services will have an influence on a decision on the use of electronic ankle chains. The Committee notes that, at the time of the judgment, the court has the necessary information on, inter alia, The nature of crime and the punishment of the accused... • What has caused the Social Democratic Party to change its mind since 26 March?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154109	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154110	Thank you for the question. The assessment in this case is that the proposal will not save criminal justice, either for administration or for expenditure, quite the contrary. And that is where we think it is essential to place emphasis on the assessments that come from the courts and from the criminal services, which of course consider that, in reality, in a large number of cases, they might use unnecessary resources to make an aptitude assessment of a person who is then perhaps not really fit to use an ankle bracelet anyway. So the short thing is that, as the proposal is here, the assessment is that it will not save the cost and time of criminal services, and in this moment and in this time we need the opposite. And I know that, sir. Preben Bang Henriksen also works actively for.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154202	Sir. Preben Bang Henriksen.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154203	I almost think it sounds like a copy of what we hear the President of the Court Association say, and I do not think it sounds very good for the forthcoming negotiations, where we should like to find out where we can change and rationalise the judicial process. But don't worry about it. What I asked for and did not get an answer to was: What has actually happened since 26 March 2015, when the Social Democracy helped to establish in a report that the sanctioning could be decided by the courts?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154230	The rapporteur.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154231	Well, I didn't do the report myself in 2015 • Unfortunately, I don't have as long seniority as Mr. Preben Bang Henriksen in this committee or in this area. However, I now think I was trying to explain why we have ended up where we are now with this proposal, namely that what is the task for us now is not just for the government, but for everyone in here is to find out how to streamline the criminal proceedings chain. We have discussed a number of other proposals on how to do this, and what is assessed, not only by the courts but also by the criminal services, is that this is not the right way to do it.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154306	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no more brief comments. This means that we move on to Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt, SF.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154324	Thank you. This proposal is, of course, about whether the courts should be able to impose an anklet settlement, where today it is the criminal services that sort of settle the case and decide who, following an application, should be given the opportunity to put on an ankle bracelet. In the SF, we are always ready to look at how to make criminal proceedings more flexible so that the time that passes between a crime being committed and the convicted person starting atonement becomes as short as possible. Of course, we would also like to share in thinking out the box and try new ways to ensure simple and effective procedures in our courts, but we cannot support this proposal. We are also well aware of this before I get the question that we actually thought this was a good idea in the past and supported a report. But I still think that some things have happened afterwards. After all, we have a huge case in the courts. We have a lack of resources and, as we understand it, this will impose new and resource-intensive tasks on the courts, which can lead to a major move on the already pressured courts. The court meetings will be longer and the time for the proceedings will also be longer overall, also because the question of ankle-link settlement will be open to appeal and thus risk withdrawing resources from several courts. All in all, it will make the proceedings heavier, and that is probably the last thing our courts need right now. So I don't think it's right now that we should have that talk. Then we must also say that it may well be that the courts take a position on, for example. community service, but when it comes to serving, the courts do not take stock of whether it should be an open or closed prison or a pension. You could say that when you get an ankle bracelet, it's a fine offer that you can apply for today. Actually, I think that's really good. That is why it fits more into the portfolio we already have, where it is actually criminal justice that determines what is the relevant solution when it comes to serving. Then there is the fact that you can only get an ankle bracelet if you are in education or have a job. It's actually almost a requirement to be taken into account in this scheme. That is precisely why it is perhaps a good thing that ankle-cracking is something that can be applied for, because some people will not like the fact that criminal services contact their workplace. In fact, they'd rather have a serving and then maybe quit. You have the opportunity to do that. Then we have also heard from our tour to the institutions of criminal justice that it can be extremely hard to serve with ankle chains and that there are in fact a not insignificant number who are asking to be returned to proper service. It can actually be quite stressful to be locked up behind the four walls of the home with any quarrels it gives with the girlfriend and wife, or because you cannot go to the playground with your child. So there are some who prefer to get into prison because there are exits that are a little more flexible than this solution. I therefore believe that in the SF we are landing on the fact that we cannot support this proposal and actually think that in the seven years that have passed, we have become wiser on the ankle chain system and we cannot therefore support the proposal. I would like to greet the Radicals and say that they say the same thing as us.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154717	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. This means that we move on to Mrs Britt Baker, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154736	Thank you. With this proposal, the Left wishes to transfer the decision-making powers in the case of ankle chains to the courts. Let me start by saying that the Conservative People's Party does not support this proposal. And we do not do so because it will result in both the courts and the criminal services being given extra work and substantial additional costs. The Court of Justice's Board of Justice considers that the transfer of decision-making powers will mean longer hearings and even longer proceedings in the criminal justice chain. And, of course, we in Conservatives are against that. We focus on reducing the length of proceedings in the criminal justice chain, so that the period between the crime is committed and the sentenced person begins to serve his sentence will be shorter. We must constantly look at how we can reduce the length of proceedings in the criminal justice chain. This is something that we are focusing on in the contract circle behind the latest police settlements and behind the multi-year agreement on the criminal justice economy of December. And that is also something that we want to focus on towards the negotiations on the economy of the courts. Here we have to look at this question, but it is right to take it in the negotiations where you can look at several proposals and look at an overall solution. And we in the Conservative People's Party will support that and that is why we do not support this resolution.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154906	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that is why we have now come to Mr Beazley's report. Peter Skaarup, Dansk Folkeparti.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519154919	Thank you for an interesting proposal from the Left to change the decision-making powers in the field of electronic anklet processing. It is, of course, a proposal on which we have had opinions in the past, discussed and made a report, etc., which the rapporteur for the proposers can also tell us about. The proposal here is to decide whether a person should be able to serve with an ankle bracelet or not be able to serve with an ankle bracelet, and whether that decision should be passed from the Department of Justice to the courts, that is to say whether it should be a part of the judgment, so that, even when you get it, you will be told whether it can be done with ankle bracelets, where it is today the Criminal Services which later comes with the assessment, and where, moreover, there is sometimes some time to go. After all, we saw in connection with former Minister Mrs Inger Løjberg that a little too much time went by, also because of some waiting time in the Ministry of Justice. But it is clear that there are basically good intentions, we think, in this proposal, because, as far as it is concerned, it is the courts that can also give other so-called conditions to the individual who gets a judgment which, on the basis of an overall assessment, can give the direction of what is actually to be done with the particular serving, there may well be some sense in it, i.e. that it is the judge and the court who decide on it. Now, as the Conservatives' rapporteur, Mrs Britt Baker, said, we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights have more or less been out visiting some of the courts as a result of the fact that, at some point this year, a multi-year agreement has to be drawn up for the economy of the courts. And we must say there, when we look at what the courts are doing today and what they are doing in the course of proceedings, that, unfortunately, this is a really bitter round for the citizens, for those who have cases in the courts, because it takes a very long time to deal with a great deal of the cases that lie ahead. So there could very much be a need for more resources to be given to deal with matters. And then you can ask: what signal will it send if we in the Danish Parliament decide today or at a third reading that they are now going to get the job where they have to decide whether they should be in an ankle bracelet or can be in an ankle bracelet or not? So the timing of this proposal may not be optimal because you already have a lot of questions to deal with. After all, you have to decide whether a person is guilty and what the penalty is. Is he to be deported? After all, there are more and more cases in which we are dealing with criminal foreigners who are not Danish citizens, and that is why the court must decide whether or not to deport them. We in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights have been told about this during this tour. And the case piles are not going to get any smaller, because corona has also made it possible for there to have been a certain decrease in cases for a period of time, and now the figures are rising again dramatically, and cases are more complicated with more defendants, drug cases etc. And if you already lack judges and people who can support the judges in their work, then perhaps that would be the wrong time to say: you will now have that great task, which it may also be to assess whether you can wear electronic anklet or not. So basically, when you are a criminal, you have to be punished and if you commit serious crime, you have to have a prison sentence. And then it is true that you make a number of different anklet schemes, among others. For reasons of lack of space in prisons, but also because it is believed that some people can administer it and, for example, in prisons. At the same time, take care of an education if you are young. So the ankle bracelet scheme is, in effect, here to stay. Should it be the courts that decide that question? Yes, there might be common sense in that, but is the timing the right one? No, we in the Danish People's Party may not think so right now. So it is unfortunately the case that we have to be as little as the Radical Left is sometimes in the process of dealing with legislative proposals in this Chamber; when they have to choose what to think, it may be a little difficult to find out what they really think. And I'm sorry if it's been like that. This is basically a positive, sensible proposal which the timing may not be quite right in terms of implementing right now.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519155413	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments, and that is why we are now moving on to the rapporteur for the authors of the motion for a resolution, Mr President. Preben Bang Henriksen, Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519155424	Thank you. You have to hear a lot before your ears fall off, even here in the Chamber. I hear Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt say that there are many people who want to go to prison instead of going home to their wives. Yes, if that is true, then I must take note of it. I hear that the length of the proceedings will be extended if we collect the jurisdiction from two places both in court and in the criminal services to one place; even if the place already has the information to be used, which already has personal investigations, has information about defendants who have the defendants in front of them and can ask the questions. No, no, they say it's taking way too long. It is much, much faster to first give a verdict and then three weeks after let the warden go out and hold interviews and write reports etc. etc. That is simply not true. It is possible that you have your information from the Court of Justice, but as we have mentioned in the past, you are very obsessed with not getting any more work there. That's why I can understand Mr. Peter Skaarup's objections that we should not impose any more work on the courts, but I'm sorry. So they were also supposed to have a bag of money. They should have the money that the Department of Justice spends on going out and dealing with this case; they should, of course, be transferred to the courts. And then I should like to say that it does not take longer than that. I would guess that in an ordinary criminal case, where you also had to take a stand on an ankle bracelet, it would take 10-15 minutes... that's where we are. In my opinion, there really was money to be saved here. I think it is appropriate that anyone convicted in a trial should also be able to see whether they are going to jail or are at home. It is not so important for them whether they are three months in prison or five months in prison. No, of course the important thing is whether they are going to jail, to put it in Danish. So today he is not told to do so when he has received his judgment in court; that means waiting for an administrative decision from the criminal services later on. I think that's a wrong way to do it, and I always thought so. I was therefore also pleased that the Committee on Legal Affairs, including those who have spoken earlier here, was able to write in complete agreement seven years ago, and I quote that the courts should therefore be able to decide, in the context of the imposition of sanctions, that the person concerned should serve his sentence using electronic ankle chains. And further, the committee therefore notes with satisfaction that the Minister of Justice, and this was the present Prime Minister, was in favour at first reading of the motion for a resolution, of the fact that the courts will have an influence on the decision on atonement, while at the same time the criminal services will continue to be able to decide on ankle-cracking if the courts have not spoken against it. In other words, it means a shared competence. The Court could decide whether to serve in an anklet; the court could also choose not to do so and then send it out to the old system. I think that is the only right thing to do. But I am not tone-deaf either, and I can hear that that view is not shared among other parties. I find that regrettable. Thank you.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519155743	Thank you to the rapporteur. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the proposal be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519155758	The debate is open. The Minister of Justice.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519155813	Thank you for the floor. And thank you to the Conservatives for putting forward this motion for a resolution. It is a proposal that raises a very important problem which is relevant both to the police and to a number of other professional groups. As it has become easier to take pictures and record each other, because we are all running around with a smartphone, we also see more and more that some people are using or maybe even using this tool to hang public employees. It may be police officers, it may be nurses, it may be sosu assistants, it may be the HK down at the job center that experiences suddenly seeing itself on social media, sometimes in ways that are directly threatening or harassing. It is, of course, totally unacceptable that there should be harassment of public employees. The value that the professional groups give to all of us by helping to look after us in health care, in day care institutions or in the police is invaluable. In the case of the police, we are talking about people who have dedicated their working lives to keeping us all safe. That is also why my predecessor, as Minister of Justice, took the initiative of dialogue with relevant organisations on how best to address this very problem. The first meeting took place in March, in other words a few months ago, where the Ministry of Justice met with a number of organisations. That was among other things. The police union, but also FOA, HK, Danmarks Lærerforening and others, and on the basis of the good input provided by the officials at the meeting, they are now looking at the possibilities for concrete initiatives. After the summer break, the possibilities will be discussed at a new meeting with the organisations. And that is why I think it would be a pity if, in parallel with them, or over the heads of the organisations which organise the employees, which this is actually about, we were to anticipate the work that is being done. But there is no doubt about where I am in this debate. I would also like to say that when I read the resolution by the Conservatives, I felt my inner trade unionist. Of course, people need to be comfortable going to work. The whole prerequisite for our having a good society to live in is that people actually get up in the morning and go to work. It is therefore also my clear view that we should therefore also look forward to discussing the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs during the committee's examination of the resolution, and I am, of course, open to including the ideas behind this resolution in the work already under way in the Ministry of Justice. In this connection, we may be able to look at formalising the work. It could be suggested that a working group be set up with the participation of representatives of the organisations. I would also like to take this opportunity to state that we already have provisions in the criminal code which make it illegal to threaten or harass police officers and other public servants for their work, including on social media. A threat need not be made directly to the person. As a general rule, the threat can also be punished if it has been made public or is intended to spread in a wider range, e.g.: in a discussion forum or the like. Harassment will also be punishable under the applicable rules by, for example, the creation of postings on hate sites on the web or similar sites and, where appropriate, could be punishable under Article 119a of the Penal Code. The fact that we need to get into the penal code is due to the fact that there is also an important counter consideration, namely the need for freedom of expression, and that citizens in a democracy must have the opportunity to express dissatisfaction with people in public service. And that leads me to what I also have to say, namely that unfortunately this issue is not quite as simple as I would like myself, and as I am sure there are many of us in this Chamber who would like us to do. Because if we are to get in and limit what we can do on social media, we are quickly encountering the opposite concern, that is, the need for freedom of expression. No matter that the purpose is to look after police officers or nurses, there is of course this concern, and that is a difficult balance, also legally. Here it is the opinion of the Ministry of Justice that a non-exceptional ban on the publication of pictures and videos where police officers can be recognised cannot be implemented within the framework of the rules of the European Convention on Human Rights on Freedom of expression. It hangs, among other things. As well as the fact that the European Court of Human Rights has established in its practice that persons in the public service in their duties are subject to a wide range of acceptable criticisms and that they must therefore tolerate more than private ones. This is linked to the fact that in a democratic society there must be a broad framework for criticising the authorities. It is such a rather complex issue that the motion for a resolution raises. That is why I also believe it is important that any new rules should be introduced after careful consideration, at the same time as involving the relevant stakeholders, and here I am thinking among other things. On the police union. In relation to the proposal that the names of police circles and not individual officers should be indicated on public access to documents, I can recognise the underlying ambition, namely that police officers should be shielded from harassment. The problem does not only include police officers; in my view, the problem also includes other particularly public-sector people who perform civic functions in our society. It's not long since I went to a family dinner and sat at the table with a police officer who, at least, had his problems in this area. I'm married to a nurse who told similar stories from health care. As most people may know, my predecessor, Nick Hækkerup, has started work on changing legislation so that the names of particularly vulnerable public employees can be exempted from access to documents to a greater extent than is currently the case. A great deal needs to be done today before such access is refused. The officials of the Ministry of Justice are working on the details of such a change of law. Basically, it is a question of finding the right balance: on the one hand, it ensures transparency, which is behind our rules on access to documents, and, on the other hand, it is a question of ensuring that public employees can go to work and feel safe and secure. Finally, the Conservative People's Party proposes that a plan be put in place to ensure that tech giants do what they can to remove material of the nature to which the resolution relates from their platforms. In March of this year, the Minister for Business put forward a bill obliging service providers of communication platforms and certain group messaging services to establish a procedure that makes it easy for anyone to notify content on platforms that are considered illegal. The service provider shall then decide whether the content is assessed illegally and, on that basis, remove, block or retain the content. The bill therefore addresses precisely the desire to ensure that service providers are obliged to ensure that illegal content is removed or blocked from their platforms. So, to summarise briefly, I would say that I very much agree with the proposers that there is an important issue that needs to be looked at. The Ministry of Justice is working on this in cooperation with a number of professional organisations, and I do not wish to anticipate that, but I look forward to discussing the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs in connection with the committee's examination of the motion for a resolution and will look, as I said, at the possibility of formalising that cooperation, for example. by setting up a working group. I am very open to involving those members of the Committee on Legal Affairs who may be behind a joint report on it in the drafting. I am very prepared to involve those Members in the formulation of the solutions to be found. And we will also be able to discuss together how to put forward political proposals on how to deal with the problem. In relation to the issue of access to documents and illegal content on social media, we are both looking at and implementing new legislation in those areas. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160607	Thank you, Minister. There is a request for a brief comment to be made to Mr Seligman. Peter Skaarup, Dansk Folkeparti. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160612	Thank you for your real support for this proposal, or at least the principles of it. I just want to ask the Minister something. I think that everything that is being said sounds good, but if you now agree and think it is a good proposal and a step in the right direction, why should you then set up working groups and ask the Police Association, which supports the proposal? Well, isn't it just voting for it?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160643	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160645	In respect of the work that has started, which is not only about police officers, but also broader about some of the most vulnerable groups in public service, I think that we should complete it and, in view of this, change our legislation. And, as I say in my speech, I am also very keen to see whether there is any way to involve those parties in the Folketing and the rapporteurs in the Legal Affairs Committee who are interested in this in a kind of working group, so that we may jointly try to draw up a legislative proposal. In addition, there are these balances with the freedom of expression that need to be found. As I said in my speech, there is a case law of the European Court of Human Rights that a certain degree of criticism must be accepted as public servants. And I guess it's fair that we should be able to criticise the authorities. Conversely, since we are all running around with a smartphone in our pockets, there must be an obligation on us as legislators to try to relate to the fact that there are many more cameras in public space than there have been in the past and that there is much easier access on public platforms to spread unacceptable criticism and harassment of public employees.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160811	Sir. Peter Skaarup.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160812	I really think that the Minister does not order anything but to speak in favour of there being a problem, but then says that there are also some other professional groups who have the same problem. And that's true. It is true that the police officers, nurses and other people in the criminal services are also exposed to such things, but then we just have to include them. But sometimes I just have such an idea that there is too much bureaucracy in it and too many working groups in it. And that's not an unknown issue. Well, I've heard about this problem raised by policemen for at least a year, and so has the Ministry of Justice. So shouldn't we get started?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160853	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160854	For at least a year too, it seems that for some time now there has been a tendency for people sometimes, I think, quite provocatively to pick up their phones in the head of public servants and also to help escalate some conflicts that should be descaled. I would also like to say that I think we are actually in the process. We are in the process of bringing about legislative changes. Part of the process is just to involve the organisations that organise the employees. What I am saying now is whether we could also include in that process some of the legal rapporteurs who have an interest in this, so that a bill can be put forward, on which we perhaps very broadly agree in the Folketing. That is also why I think that perhaps we could jointly try to write a report on this motion for a resolution, which could then be the basis on which I, as a minister, should call the rapporteurs.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160952	The next brief remark is to Mrs Britt Baker, Conservative People's Party. Here you go.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519160955	Thank you and thank the Minister for meeting part of this proposal and at least acknowledge that there is a problem with the Danish officers who are filmed and put into small clips on special Facebook and other social media. And I am pleased that the Minister is proposing a working group. I would actually just like to make a suggestion which I hope the Minister will be able to accept, namely that we are creating a fast-working working working group, so that this will not be some pickle jar, which will not turn into anything, but that we will all be able to do something about it, hopefully, at least many of us are so concerned about this problem, so that we can do something about it. So if the Minister could just confirm that we are talking about a rapid working group, that we look each other in the eye quite quickly and that hopefully we can make a proposal on this this year?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161055	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161056	I can totally confirm that this has to be fast-working. I would also like to say that there are many aspects to this. Now I mentioned in my speech that I myself have a background in the trade union movement and I am concerned that one should be able to go to work and be protected. Actually, I think so. And I often think: now I'm the Minister of Justice, and what are some of the prints I'm putting on this society in the time I'm now sitting in the chair? There you can point to several different things, but one of the things that fills me up is that you can go to work in the criminal services and in the police and be safe that society cares for you. I think that is actually quite relevant, and I also believe that it has an impact in terms of being able to recruit people for some important functions in our society. So I am completely politically involved and have a heart in relation to this matter, and I myself am extra provoked by the fact that there are some people who are absolutely not highly paid who are putting much at risk by going to work. They perform a crazyly important function in our society and actually meet 24-7, and then there must be someone standing next to, who may be on the support and who does nothing but harass people and then has to make it more healthy to go to work for the people who are employed to look after us. Actually, it's something I'm getting pretty provoked about myself. So we're gonna get to the end of this; I just really don't want to short-circuit the process that's already under way, not only with the Police Union, but also with other professional organisations.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161222	Mrs. Britt Baker.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161223	And neither are we. We should not short-circuit any process; we should set a little fumes in that process. I am very pleased with what the Minister said. The Minister just forgot to answer my question, which is why I just want to hear: is the Minister prepared for this working party to be quick-working and for us to get to the end of this in 2022?
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161246	The minister.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161247	I understand it's gonna be fast-working. The idea is that there are some concrete proposals on the table immediately after the summer break that we can discuss with the organisations. I also think that although the parliamentary year formally opens only at the beginning of October, we, as ministers and as rapporteurs, should be able to meet before, also to discuss some of these proposals, so that we can ask the officials to write a bill. I do not know whether it will be submitted before Christmas, but at least I know that we will have the political discussions with each other during the autumn. I totally agree with that.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161317	Thank you, Minister. There are no more brief remarks to the Minister, and then we start with the number of rapporteurs for the parties, and the first party is the Social Democratic Party by Mr. Bjørn Brandenborg. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161330	Thank you for that, President, and thank you to Mrs Britt Baker and the Conservative People's Party for the resolution. It is a very, very important and central issue that is being raised with this proposal. Basically, our police officers must be able to go to work and carry out their important task of protecting the rest of us without even being threatened or harassed. There we are fully in line with the intentions behind the proposal. The proposal also contains some very specific parts which the proposers wish to implement. We have just heard the Minister for Justice review the work that has already been started on the complex challenges we are facing with harassment of our public employees, and I am pleased that the relevant organisations are involved in this. As I understood the Minister, we need to have a little more meetings with the organisations, and we can consider not just a working group, but a rapid working group with representatives of the organisations, which also means that we obviously have to come to work earlier. So now that work has already begun, we may need to think more in this direction than overtake it with a number of specific measures. The Minister has indicated that further work is being done on the issue and that he is open to including the ideas behind the resolution in the work already under way. So from my point of view and from the point of view of the Social Democrats, we are just very much looking forward to discussing the various solutions with the Minister, the organisations and those of the rapporteurs who want to take part in this very, very important debate. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161505	Thank you to the Socialist rapporteur. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur. The next rapporteur comes from the Left, and that is Mr Seligman. Preben Bang Henriksen. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161517	Thank you. Thank you to the Conservative People's Party for making this proposal. I might as well trigger the tension immediately by saying that we are voting 100% for this proposal. This is a really good subject, namely the relationship with and protection of the Danish police officers. I don't have to make a long speech. I know that many others are concentrating on repeating what has been said before, but I will not do so. I refer to the speech by the Social Democrat rapporteur. That's quite fine. The situation we have today is that you can film police officers. We must continue to do so and, if necessary, if we violate the law, that film must be used to be sent to the Independent Police Prosecutor's Office. It should not be used to be posted on social media and cause some sort of harassment against a police officer. That is why we fully agree with the proposal that police officers should be better protected. They must be given greater anonymity in their work and thus also ensured against the sharing of image material on the media in the face of harassment. However, I would stress that we should not have a society in which we should not be allowed to film the police in general, but, if we are to believe that there is an offence, we should do so with a view to bringing a complaint to the Independent Police Prosecutor's Office. That is absolutely right, as the Minister says: we have provisions in the criminal code that ensure both against threats and other things against public servants, including police officers, namely Paragraph 119b. It is just very rare that it is used in any case it is my impression and therefore I would like us to mark the point of view that lies here in the proposal even more than is the case today. We can fully support the proposal. The only thing that makes me a little nervous is when I hear that a working group has been set up, because such a group tends to be a little longer, but Mrs Britt Baker was so nice to confront the Minister of Justice several times with the fact that it should be a fast-working working working group, and that, I understood, was the result. So with these words there is full support from the Left.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161734	Thank you to the rapporteur from the Left. There are no brief comments. The next rapporteur comes from the Socialist People's Party, and that is Mrs Karina Lorentzen Dehnhardt. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519161751	Thank you. Then it was my turn. As some people noticed, I was a little impatient and was on my way when the Left was coming up here. I think we should thank Conservatives for putting forward the proposal, because it is actually a very important issue and the problem raised is real. After all, I think that public employees should be able to feel safe at work and at leisure, and it is, of course, unacceptable if the rules on access to documents are misused to harass, intimidate public employees. We just have to say that the current rules do not provide the right protection, for example. the security of police and prison staff. The right of access to the name of public servants is, of course, also an important and important consideration at the same time. After all, there may be legitimate reasons why a citizen or the media wants to know the name of a public servant, and openness in the administration is also quite central. In fact, this is also the reason why we in the Danish Parliament want a new public law, at least some of us. In relation to anonymisation, we are faced with a clear dilemma. I think that if this is a harassment of the rules for the purpose of intimidating or exhibiting police or prison staff, we should not accept it, but on the other hand, citizens also have this legitimate right to be able to document something. We've just seen from some cases that Nordjyske has described, that if you don't have that video strip, you're very uncomfortable if you want to complain about the police's treatment. It is, of course, a balance between the two outer poles that you have to walk when you have to make some rules in this area, and that is why I really think that the idea of putting blurry videos out could be a tool in this context. But the short part of the long one, like others here today, is that work has been started in the Ministry of Justice, and that is where I think the elements of this proposal should be included, and I think we are going to wait for that work on an equal footing with others. We really share the intention to ensure better conditions for both police officers, prison officers and, incidentally, other public sector groups. I have to report the same on behalf of the Radicals. Thank you for the floor.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519162027	Thank you to the rapporteur. It is noted that the Radical Left has welcomed it. Then it is the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There is a great desire to come to the platform, but the President insists on sticking in the correct order. So I give the floor to Mr. Peter Skaarup from the Danish People's Party. Welcome.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519162049	Thank you very much. If you are a police officer, you must, of course, be able to do your job without being filmed because someone is running around with a camera and recording everything that is going on and, of course, for the sole purpose of exhibiting this police officer. Poor man just doing his job. If you know of the conditions and work of the officers, you know that they often work under enormous pressure, severe pressure in certain situations. It may be the preparedness that is out trying to resolve a highly tense conflict between some people. It could be an assault going on. So if you want to lie down as a cop, you run the risk of taking a small clip that distorts everything you've been working on in the situation. If you work under pressure, yes, you are in a vulnerable situation, and our legislation and our politicians, as we are in the Folketing, should of course take that into account when what is happening is becoming more and more widespread. We shouldn't want our cops to be acting out or making mistakes just because they're afraid to be photographed in situations. Sometimes we actually see that these recordings are more or less designed so that something is planned to happen. In other words, it is not always random that something happens exactly while someone is on the spot with a camera. I'm not necessarily talking about a camera from a cell phone here. These are quite simply working conditions which we cannot be aware of today to bid our hard-tested officers. Basically, we in the Danish People's Party do not object to filming the policemen's work, but it must of course be done in a proper way that does not make their work difficult or harass them. And if you do so in order to post some recordings on the web, where the individual officer is shown, then it is simply not okay. This public mouth stick has actually been abolished many years ago. There may be recordings that have a value because they document it if a police officer has exceeded his powers, but then it is not a matter for the general public, but rather an errand between those involved, the officer and his employer, not the public. No employee deserves to be in that position. Our good proposers here describe the proposal very well in the comments and, of course, describe how particularly small clips make it problematic, precisely because you do not see the context itself. But even if it's the séance itself that's being put to public viewing, it's still not fair that the clip be published so you can identify the cop. For it can be a small clip that is only a small part of the big context. So, of course, we can support this proposal, which, in its simplicity, ensures that if you have footage of officers who are just doing their job, whatever you think of it, you are obliged to blur the identity of those concerned if the recordings are published. So if you want to show something, it should not be the individual officer and the identity of the person concerned, but rather a policeman who does a job. Because it must also be the case that, when you take off your uniform, the cop must be able to act as a normal civilian citizen, without being seen publicly on all the social platforms in the world. This isn't just about cops. This also applies to prison officers, to nurses and to others. Because, as I said, you have really done your job, and through it you may have come into situations that others do not think are right. It is a well-known fact that a police business for outsiders can easily look strange and violent. On the one hand, you may not know the history and the prelude to the clip that has been made, and on the other you may not know how the police also perform their work perfectly according to the rules. And then it's easy to criticize on the basis of a recording where you show something. If such a recording is posted on the Internet, it will hurt a lot more than it benefits. That's not fair. In this proposal, our proposers, i.e. Conservatives, are also in favour of the tech giants shouldering responsibility for the removal of compromising recordings. We are happy to support this in the Danish People's Party, certainly. But I think that the important thing here is primarily to focus on those who post the videos and get it done so that you publish these footage, so of course the cops have to be blurry. And then it's important to get this proposal adopted quickly, because it's an old problem that we have to deal with in here to support our good cops. That is why there is no delay, no slow-moving working group, if that is where it ends. Fast-working, fast-track legislation, and by 2022, as the rapporteur said we should.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519162616	Thank you to the rapporteur of the Danish People's Party. There are no brief comments to be made to the rapporteur, and I can give the floor to the rapporteur for the authors of the motion, and that is Mrs Britt Baker, the Conservative People's Party.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519162628	Thank you. Last Sunday I was with a family member who is a police officer, and I asked him if he had ever been filmed when he was at work. Yes, he said I was every day when I worked as a cop on the streets of Copenhagen. And he said it quite quietly, as if it were the greatest of course in the whole world. Police officers live every day with the threat that their work will be filmed, cut and hung out on the Internet. One thing is if an entire episode is filmed and laid out, but this is very rarely the case. When small bites of a longer episode are laid out, it shows only a small part of an often very long séance. An arrest is extremely rare without foreplay, without prior scenes and trouble. But that foreplay is very rare in the tiny clip that is brought online. What is being brought is usually the arrest itself, where the arrested person opposes it, and therefore a police officer has to take a hard hold sometimes to have the arrested person locked in handcuffs. Little bits of movies simply undermine the work of cops, and little bits of movies can damage the public's confidence in our police. But it's actually not the worst thing. It can also have serious human consequences and costs for the policeman who is being beaten and harassed. But let me make it clear that no one can misunderstand: this resolution will continue to be legal to film the police, because we believe that it should continue to be legal to film the police in action and that we believe that it should continue to be possible to put it on Facebook, because the police must be responsible for what they are doing. But our skilled police should not be shown, harassed and sought out privately, so you want to bring a bite of a clip on Facebook, the name and number of the officer should be anonymised, and if you want to complain about a cop, it should be done to the independent police prosecutor's office and not to the public court on Facebook. Short video bites are only put on social media for the sole purpose of undermining the work of the cops. They only show a snapshot, often the part where there is force, and they do not show the whole incident, and therefore it is often a distorted picture. When shopkeepers share surveillance photos of burglars stealing arms and legs, we punish shop owners with fines for breaches of personal data rules. So here we are protecting the criminals. But when it comes to the police, who work to protect all of us, we can just film and share, because here the public interest is more important than the safety of the cops. Of course, the legal certainty that we ourselves demand must also be provided for our officers, because those who protect us must also be protected. That is why I am also pleased that so many parties have welcomed this proposal and I am pleased that the Minister will set up a rapid working group with the involvement of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. For the Conservative People's Party, it is absolutely fundamental that we should protect the Danish police, and therefore I thank you for your support for this proposal.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519163011	Thank you to the rapporteur for the authors, Mrs Britt Baker. There are no brief comments. As no one else has asked to speak, the debate is closed. I propose that the draft parliamentary resolution be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee. Are there any comments? It's agreed.
ParlaMint-DK_20220519163026	Then there is no more to be done in this meeting. The next meeting of the Danish Parliament will be held tomorrow, Friday 20 May 2022, kl. 10:00.
